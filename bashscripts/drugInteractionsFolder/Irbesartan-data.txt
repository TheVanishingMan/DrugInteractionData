        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group.",

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX­-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact QUALITEST PHARMACEUTICALS at 1-800-444-4011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo(n=236) (%) Irbesartan(n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3%, 3.8%, and 1% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and / or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function. (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume-or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with AVALIDE were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the AVALIDE treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with AVALIDE as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVALIDE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVALIDE. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), hepatitis and tinnitus. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and AVALIDE. Cases of increased CPK have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of AVALIDE. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone. No patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6) .]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function. (5.7) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue AVALIDE as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Coadministration of AVALIDE with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with Irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of Irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with Irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with Irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the Irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%).

Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving Irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the Irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the Irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) : In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. •NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. •Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. •Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. •Cholestyramine and Colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides. •Lithium: Inreases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity. •NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. •Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Roxane Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide: Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236)(%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan: Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide: Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy: In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3%, 3.8%, and 1% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) •Impaired renal function. (5.8) •Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) •Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide: Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide: In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX­-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist, including irbesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDS including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (eg, Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. • NSAIDS and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risks of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. • Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. • Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required • Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides •Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity • NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk of renal impairment. • Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/ HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration.(5.2). Impaired renal function (5.8). Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (5.4). Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals[see Drug Interactions (7)] . In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "Drug Interactions No significant drug-drug pharmacokinetic (or pharmacodynamic) interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3 occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "Drug Interactions : Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and lithium. Lithium studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In vitro in vitro In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Monitor renal function and serum potassium. (5.3) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume - or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume-or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with irbesartan. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of irbesartan or use a lower starting dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure or death on irbesartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on irbesartan [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]."

It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/ dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomylosis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION.) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "Warnings Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue irbesartan, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to irbesartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (See PRECAUTIONS: PEDIATRIC USE). When pregnant rats were treated with irbesartan from day 0 to day 20 of gestation (oral doses of 50 mg/kg/day, 180 mg/kg/day, and 650 mg/kg/day), increased incidences of renal pelvic cavitation, hydroureter and/or absence of renal papilla were observed in fetuses at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD], 300 mg/day, on a body surface area basis). Subcutaneous edema was observed in fetuses at doses ≥180 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the MRHD on a body surface area basis). As these anomalies were not observed in rats in which irbesartan exposure (oral doses of 50, 150, and 450 mg/ kg/day) was limited to gestation days 6 to 15, they appear to reflect late gestational effects of the drug. In pregnant rabbits, oral doses of 30 mg irbesartan/kg/day were associated with maternal mortality and abortion. Surviving females receiving this dose (about 1.5 times the MRHD on a body surface area basis) had a slight increase in early resorptions and a corresponding decrease in live fetuses. Irbesartan was found to cross the placental barrier in rats and rabbits. Radioactivity was present in the rat and rabbit fetus during late gestation and in rat milk following oral doses of radiolabeled irbesartan. Hypotension in Volume-or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen (<0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume-or sodium-depletion, eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of irbesartan, or a low starting dose should be used (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. Irbesartan (7): NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥ 5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p = 0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥ 1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ Placebo Irbesartan HCTZ (n = 898) (n = 236) (n = 400) (n = 380) (%) (%) (%) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (< 0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.9 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "Drug Interactions Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and lithium. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan- treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hyper-tensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS : Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan tablets was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan tablets. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan tablets, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan tablets (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan tablets group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan tablets. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face,lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis;hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan tablets.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic of diuretic, my lead to increased risk of renal impairment and reduced antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. (7) Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7) Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. (7) Cholestyramine and Colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides (7) Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity (7) Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia. (7) 7.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) Irbesartan In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. 7.2 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). 7.3 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.4 Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. 7.5 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin. 7.6 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium. 7.7 Carbamazepine Concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Monitor electrolytes during concomitant use."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) Hydrochlorothiazide (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide treatment group and there was one reported event in the hydrochlorothiazide treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3%, 3.8%, and 1% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and hydrochlorothiazide alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), hepatitis and tinnitus. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired Renal Function. (5.7) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Alcohol, Barbiturates, Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Corticosteroids, ACTH: Hypokalemia, electrolyte depletion Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Observe patient closely. Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been reported with irbesartan. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with AVALIDE. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5) .] Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when AVALIDE (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on AVALIDE and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide AVALIDE Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with AVALIDE, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with AVALIDE was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of AVALIDE therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with AVALIDE occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with AVALIDE were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the AVALIDE treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with AVALIDE as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVALIDE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVALIDE. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of AVALIDE. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone. No patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6) .]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic hypotension with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion. Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. Not recommended as initial therapy in volume-depleted patients (2.4, 5.2). Impaired hepatic function: Thiazides should be used with caution as minor fluid and electrolyte imbalances may precipitate hepatic coma (5.7). Impaired renal function: Use with caution. Oliguria or azotemia with acute renal failure and/or death has been reported in medications affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (5.8). Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (5.4). 5.1 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality AVALIDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. In several dozen published cases, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Similar renal findings occur in reproductive toxicology studies in rats. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides. [See Drug Interactions (7) .] 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. In diabetic patients, dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus, latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or 4 hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. •NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. •Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. •Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. •Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides. •Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity. •NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. •Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the hydrochlorothiazide treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3%, 3.8%, and 1% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and hydrochlorothiazide alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) •Impaired renal function. (5.7) •Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) •Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (< 0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic of diuretic, may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and reduced antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. (7) Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. (7) Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. (7) Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides (7) Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity (7) Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia. (7) 7.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX- 2 Inhibitors) Irbesartan In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. 7.2 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). 7.3 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.4 Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. 7.5 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that irbesartan -hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin. 7.6 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and lithium. 7.7 Carbamazepine Concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Monitor electrolytes during concomitant use."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on irbesartan -hydrochlorothiazide and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan / HCTZ ( n = 898 )(%) Placebo ( n = 236 )(%) Irbesartan ( n = 400 )(%) HCTZ ( n = 380 )(%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal / Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis and tinnitus. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function (5.7) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium<3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "Drug Interactions No significant drug-drug pharmacokinetic (or pharmacodynamic) interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan- treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hyper-tensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE, Inc. at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com ; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS : Impaired Renal Function.) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hyper-tensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo (See PRECAUTIONS : Impaired Renal Function). Hematologic Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group vs. 6% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% vs. 0.4% in the placebo group."

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Alcohol, Barbiturates, Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Corticosteroids, ACTH: Hypokalemia, electrolyte depletion Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Observe patient closely. Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been reported with irbesartan. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (eg, Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with AVALIDE. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5) .] Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when AVALIDE (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on AVALIDE and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide AVALIDE (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) Tablets has been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with AVALIDE, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with AVALIDE was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of AVALIDE therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with AVALIDE occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 7 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 0 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 7 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 ct2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with AVALIDE were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the AVALIDE treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with AVALIDE as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVALIDE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVALIDE. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of AVALIDE. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone. No patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6) .]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Symptomatic hypotension with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion. Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. Not recommended as initial therapy in volume-depleted patients (2.4, 5.2). Impaired hepatic function: Thiazides should be used with caution as minor fluid and electrolyte imbalances may precipitate hepatic coma (5.7). Impaired renal function: Use with caution. Oliguria or azotemia with acute renal failure and/or death has been reported in medications affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (5.8). Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (5.4). 5.1 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality AVALIDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. In several dozen published cases, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Similar renal findings occur in reproductive toxicology studies in rats. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides. [See Drug Interactions (7) .] 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (eg, increased ventricular irritability). Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis. Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. In diabetic patients, dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus, latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with AVAPRO was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of AVAPRO. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with AVAPRO, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVAPRO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVAPRO. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of AVAPRO. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVAPRO alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving AVAPRO compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving AVAPRO (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the AVAPRO group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

There were no reported events of syncope in the Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablet treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "Drug Interactions Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Avapro and lithium. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on AVAPRO and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with AVAPRO was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of AVAPRO. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with AVAPRO, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan- treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVAPRO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVAPRO. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, and tinnitus. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of AVAPRO. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVAPRO alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving AVAPRO compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving AVAPRO (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the AVAPRO group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. •NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. •Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. •Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required •Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides •Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity •NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. • Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥ 5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p = 0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥ 1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ Placebo Irbesartan HCTZ (n = 898) (n = 236) (n = 400) (n = 380) (%) (%) (%) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) •Impaired renal function. (5.8) •Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) •Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (< 0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with AVAPRO was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of AVAPRO. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with AVAPRO, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVAPRO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVAPRO. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of AVAPRO. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVAPRO alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving AVAPRO compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving AVAPRO (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the AVAPRO group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX‑-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist, including irbesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDS including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (eg, Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. • NSAIDS and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risks of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. • Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. • Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required • Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides •Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity • NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk of renal impairment. • Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain ( 6.1 ).To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/ HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6).]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration.(5.2). •Impaired renal function (5.8). •Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (5.4). •Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals[see Drug Interactions (7)] . In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "Drug Interactions No significant drug-drug pharmacokinetic (or pharmacodynamic) interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan- treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hyper-tensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function. ) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm 3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan (7): NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia. Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on AVALIDE and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with AVALIDE in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with AVALIDE in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. AVALIDE should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with AVALIDE. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5) .] Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when AVALIDE (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use.",
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on AVALIDE and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide AVALIDE Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with AVALIDE, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with AVALIDE was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of AVALIDE therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with AVALIDE occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with AVALIDE were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the AVALIDE treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on AVALIDE, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with AVALIDE as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on AVALIDE and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2) .] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVALIDE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVALIDE. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and AVALIDE. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of AVALIDE. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone. No patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking AVALIDE due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with AVALIDE alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6) .]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function. (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue AVALIDE as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides. [See Drug Interactions (7) .] 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.9 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.",

Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-depleted Patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Impaired Renal Function [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients: The most common adverse reactions which were more frequent than placebo were hyperkalemia dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with potassium>6 mEq/L was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group. In IDNT, the adverse reactions were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms which occurred more frequently in the irbesartan versus placebo group: dizziness (10.2% vs 6.0%), orthostatic dizziness (5.4% vs 2.7%) and orthostatic hypotension (5.4% vs 3.2%). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia; thrombocytopenia; increased CPK; tinitus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Monitor renal function and serum potassium. (5.3) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan as soon as possible [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g. those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with irbesartan. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of irbesartan or use a lower starting dose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4)]. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure or death on irbesartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on irbesartan [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. Irbesartan (7): NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥ 5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, please call the AvKARE Customer Response line at 1-855-361-3993 Monday through Friday 8am-5pm EST (Except Holidays) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p = 0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥ 1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ Placebo Irbesartan HCTZ (n = 898) (n = 236) (n = 400) (n = 380) (%) (%) (%) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥ 110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (< 0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.9 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with AVAPRO was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of AVAPRO. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with AVAPRO, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%).

Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of AVAPRO. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVAPRO alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving AVAPRO compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving AVAPRO (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group.

However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3 occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1 to 3 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "Drug Interactions Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Avapro and lithium. In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites with the known cytochrome CYP 2C9 substrates/inhibitors sulphenazole, tolbutamide and nifedipine. However, in clinical studies the consequences of concomitant irbesartan on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin were negligible. Based on in vitro data, no interaction would be expected with drugs whose metabolism is dependent upon cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. In separate studies of patients receiving maintenance doses of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, or digoxin, irbesartan administration for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin (prothrombin time) or pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by coadministration of nifedipine or hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on AVAPRO and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with AVAPRO in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension AVAPRO has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with AVAPRO was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of AVAPRO. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with AVAPRO, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with AVAPRO (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia, and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan- treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the AVAPRO group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVAPRO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AVAPRO. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, and tinnitus. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of AVAPRO. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with AVAPRO alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving AVAPRO compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving AVAPRO (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0–3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the AVAPRO group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the AVAPRO group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs Additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine) Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine) Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine Concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole Fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular Flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic Pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances Sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal Diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue Musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System Anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary Prostate disorder Respiratory Cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses Vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole Weakness Digestive Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity Purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal Muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric Restlessness Renal Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin Erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses Transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function. (5.8) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 ) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomylosis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS • NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic of diuretic, may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and reduced antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. (7) • Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7) • Antidiabetic drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required. (7) • Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides (7) • Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity (7) • Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia. (7) 7.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) Irbesartan In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs.Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. 7.2 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). 7.3 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tabletswith other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 7.4 Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. 7.5 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets are administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin. 7.6 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and lithium. 7.7 Carbamazepine Concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Monitor electrolytes during concomitant use."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866 210 9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo(n=236) (%) Irbesartan(n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3%, 3.8%, and 1% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2% [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), hepatitis and tinnitus. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and / or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes. Serum Electrolytes: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function. (5.7) Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume-or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Coadministration of Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan tablets was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan tablets. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan tablets, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan tablets (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan tablets group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan (7): NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. Hydrochlorothiazide (7): Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk for renal impairment. Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia. Irbesartan No significant drug-drug interactions have been found in interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, warfarin, and nifedipine. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5) .] Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use."

In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2)] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria, angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue), and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. (5.2) Impaired renal function (5.8). Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. (5.4) Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, e.g., in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides. [See Drug Interactions (7) .] 5.6 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan-Hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.8 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.9 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. Treatment with irbesartan was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. These events generally were mild and transient with no relationship to the dose of irbesartan. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event was required in 3.3% of patients treated with irbesartan, versus 4.5% of patients given placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse event experiences reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs. 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs. 1%), and fatigue (4% vs. 3%). The following adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in patients treated with irbesartan, but were at least as frequent or more frequent in patients receiving placebo: abdominal pain, anxiety/nervousness, chest pain, dizziness, edema, headache, influenza, musculoskeletal pain, pharyngitis, nausea/vomiting, rash, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tachycardia and urinary tract infection. Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was low in irbesartan-treated patients (0.4%), unrelated to dosage, and similar to the incidence among placebo-treated patients (0.2%). Dizziness, syncope, and vertigo were reported with equal or less frequency in patients receiving irbesartan compared with placebo. In addition, the following potentially important events occurred in less than 1% of the 1965 patients and at least 5 patients (0.3%) receiving irbesartan in clinical studies, and those less frequent, clinically significant events (listed by body system). It cannot be determined whether these events were causally related to irbesartan: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardio-respiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: constipation, oral lesion, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: abnormal urination, prostate disorder Respiratory: epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis, other eye disturbance, eyelid abnormality, ear abnormality Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In clinical studies in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetic renal disease, the adverse drug experiences were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms (dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension) observed in IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL). In this trial, orthostatic symptoms occurred more frequently in the irbesartan group (dizziness 10.2%, orthostatic dizziness 5.4%, orthostatic hypotension 5.4%) than in the placebo group (dizziness 6.0%, orthostatic dizziness 2.7%, orthostatic hypotension 3.2%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan. The following have been reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure, has been reported. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension In controlled clinical trials, clinically important differences in laboratory tests were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 0.7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan alone versus 0.9% on placebo. (See PRECAUTIONS: Impaired Renal Function .) Hematologic: Mean decreases in hemoglobin of 0.2 g/dL were observed in 0.2% of patients receiving irbesartan compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm3) occurred at similar frequencies among patients receiving irbesartan (0.3%) and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In IDNT (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Irbesartan Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX­-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist, including irbesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDS including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin): dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other Antihypertensive Drugs: additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken at least one hour before or four hours after these medications. Corticosteroids, ACTH: intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (eg, Norepinephrine): possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, Tubocurarine): possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carbamazepine: concomitant use of carbamazepine and hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with the risk of symptomatic hyponatremia. Electrolytes should be monitored during concomitant use. • NSAIDS and selective COX-2 inhibitors: May lead to increased risks of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. Monitor renal function periodically. • Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. • Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required • Cholestyramine and colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides •Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity • NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics and increase risk of renal impairment. • Carbamazepine: Increased risk of hyponatremia."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (≥5% on Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and more often than on placebo) are dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1694 patients treated for essential hypertension in 6 clinical trials. In Studies I through IV with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, no adverse events peculiar to this combination drug product have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with the combination and placebo. In general, treatment with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 3.6%. This incidence was significantly less (p=0.023) than the 6.8% of patients treated with placebo who discontinued therapy. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events reported with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets occurred in ≥1% of patients, and more often on the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo, regardless of drug relationship: Irbesartan/ HCTZ (n=898) (%) Placebo (n=236) (%) Irbesartan (n=400) (%) HCTZ (n=380) (%) Body as a Whole Chest Pain 2 1 2 2 Fatigue 6 3 4 3 Influenza 3 1 2 2 Cardiovascular Edema 3 3 2 2 Tachycardia 1 0 1 1 Gastrointestinal Abdominal Pain 2 1 2 2 Dyspepsia/heartburn 2 1 0 2 Nausea/vomiting 3 0 2 2 Immunology Allergy 1 0 1 1 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal Pain 6 5 6 10 Nervous System Dizziness 8 4 6 5 Dizziness Orthostatic 1 0 1 1 Renal/Genitourinary Abnormality Urination 2 1 1 2 The following adverse events were also reported at a rate of 1% or greater, but were as, or more, common in the placebo group: headache, sinus abnormality, cough, URI, pharyngitis, diarrhea, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, rash, anxiety/nervousness, and muscle cramp. Adverse events occurred at about the same rates in men and women, older and younger patients, and black and non-black patients. Adverse events in Studies V and VI were similar to those described above in Studies I through IV. Irbesartan Other adverse events that have been reported with irbesartan, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: fever, chills, orthostatic effects, facial edema, upper extremity edema Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, cardiac murmur, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypotension, syncope, arrhythmic/conduction disorder, cardiorespiratory arrest, heart failure, hypertensive crisis Dermatologic: pruritus, dermatitis, ecchymosis, erythema face, urticaria Endocrine/Metabolic/Electrolyte Imbalances: sexual dysfunction, libido change, gout Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, gastroenteritis, flatulence, abdominal distention Musculoskeletal/Connective Tissue: musculoskeletal trauma, extremity swelling, muscle cramp, arthritis, muscle ache, musculoskeletal chest pain, joint stiffness, bursitis, muscle weakness Nervous System: anxiety/nervousness, sleep disturbance, numbness, somnolence, vertigo, emotional disturbance, depression, paresthesia, tremor, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident Renal/Genitourinary: prostate disorder Respiratory: cough, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, tracheobronchitis, congestion, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea, wheezing Special Senses: vision disturbance, hearing abnormality, ear infection, ear pain, conjunctivitis Hydrochlorothiazide Other adverse events that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Initial Therapy In the moderate hypertension Study V (mean SeDBP between 90 and 110 mmHg), the types and incidences of adverse events reported for patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were similar to the adverse event profile in patients on initial irbesartan or HCTZ monotherapy. There were no reported events of syncope in the irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets treatment group and there was one reported event in the HCTZ treatment group. The incidences of pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan, and HCTZ, respectively, were: 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypotension; 3.0%, 3.8%, and 1.0% for dizziness; 5.5%, 3.8%, and 4.8% for headache; 1.2%, 0%, and 1.0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.9%, 0%, and 0% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, irbesartan alone, and HCTZ alone were 6.7%, 3.8%, and 4.8%. In the severe hypertension (SeDBP ≥110 mmHg) Study VI, the overall pattern of adverse events reported through 7 weeks of follow-up was similar in patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy and in patients treated with irbesartan as initial therapy. The incidences of the pre-specified adverse events on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and irbesartan, respectively, were: 0% and 0% for syncope; 0.6% and 0% for hypotension; 3.6% and 4.0% for dizziness; 4.3% and 6.6% for headache; 0.2% and 0% for hyperkalemia; and 0.6% and 0.4% for hypokalemia. The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2.1% and 2.2%. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The following have been very rarely reported: urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); and hepatitis. Hyperkalemia has been rarely reported. Very rare cases of jaundice have been reported with irbesartan. Impaired renal function, including cases of renal failure in patients at risk, has been reported with irbesartan and irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Cases of increased CPK and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone. No patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to increased BUN. One patient discontinued taking irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a minor increase in serum creatinine. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. In patients with essential hypertension treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets alone, one patient was discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration.(5.2). Impaired renal function (5.8). Thiazide diuretics may cause an exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (5.4). Acute myopia and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. (5.9) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients Excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with irbesartan alone (<0.1%) or with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (approximately 1%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume- or sodium-depletion, eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. Such volume depletion should be corrected prior to administration of antihypertensive therapy. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.4 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was <1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide. Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium may lead to increases in serum potassium. Concurrent therapy with hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the frequency of this effect. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals[see Drug Interactions (7)] . In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated. Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Sulfonamide or sulfonamide derivative drugs, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can cause idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy."
