        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Strong to moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors: Coadministration may increase RILUTEK-associated adverse reactions (7.1) -Strong to moderate CYP1A2 inducers: Coadministration may result in decreased efficacy (7.2) -Hepatotoxic drugs: RILUTEK-treated patients that take other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for hepatotoxicity (7.3) 7.1 Agents that may Increase Riluzole Blood Concentrations CYP1A2 inhibitors Co-administration of RILUTEK (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inhibitors was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest an increase in riluzole exposure is likely. The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton) with RILUTEK may increase the risk of RILUTEK-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Agents that may Decrease Riluzole Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 inducers Co-administration of RILUTEK (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest a decrease in riluzole exposure is likely. Lower exposures may result in decreased efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Hepatotoxic Drugs Clinical trials in ALS patients excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). RILUTEK-treated patients who take other hepatotoxic drugs may be at an increased risk for hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: -Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo) were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, and abdominal pain (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Covis Pharmaceuticals Inc at 1-866-488-4423 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials In the placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with ALS (Study 1 and 2), a total of 313 patients received RILUTEK 50 mg twice daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The most common adverse reactions in the RILUTEK group (in at least 5% of patients and more frequently than in the placebo group) were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, and abdominal pain. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the RILUTEK group were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and elevated ALT. There was no difference in rates of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in females and males. However, the incidence of dizziness was higher in females (11%) than in males (4%). The adverse reaction profile was similar in older and younger patients. There were insufficient data to determine if there were differences in the adverse reaction profile in different races. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of RILUTEK-treated patients (50 mg twice daily) in pooled Study 1 and 2, and at a higher rate than placebo. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials (Studies 1 and 2) in Patients with ALS RILUTEK 50 mg twice daily (N=313) Placebo (N=320) Asthenia 19% 12% Nausea 16% 11% Decreased lung function 10% 9% Hypertension 5% 4% Abdominal pain 5% 4% Vomiting 4% 2% Arthralgia 4% 3% Dizziness 4% 3% Dry mouth 4% 3% Insomnia 4% 3% Pruritus 4% 3% Tachycardia 3% 1% Flatulence 3% 2% Increased cough 3% 2% Peripheral edema 3% 2% Urinary Tract Infection 3% 2% Circumoral paresthesia 2% 0% Somnolence 2% 1% Vertigo 2% 1% Eczema 2% 1% 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RILUTEK. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. -Acute hepatitis and icteric toxic hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Renal tubular impairment"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hepatic injury: Use of RILUTEK is not recommended in patients with baseline elevations of serum aminotransferases greater than 5 times upper limit of normal; discontinue RILUTEK if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (5.1) -Neutropenia: Advise patients to report any febrile illness (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease: Discontinue RILUTEK if interstitial lung disease develops (5.3) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Cases of drug-induced liver injury, some of which were fatal, have been reported in patients taking RILUTEK. Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases have also been reported, and in some patients have recurred upon rechallenge with RILUTEK. In clinical studies, the incidence of elevations in hepatic transaminases was greater in RILUTEK-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. The incidence of elevations of ALT above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2% in RILUTEK-treated patients. Maximum increases in ALT occurred within 3 months after starting RILUTEK. About 50% and 8% of RILUTEK-treated patients in pooled Studies 1 and 2, had at least one elevated ALT level above ULN and above 3 times ULN, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury, every month for the first 3 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. The use of RILUTEK is not recommended if patients develop hepatic transaminases levels greater than 5 times the ULN. Discontinue RILUTEK if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (e.g., elevated bilirubin). 5.2 Neutropenia Cases of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per mm3) within the first 2 months of RILUTEK treatment have been reported. Advise patients to report febrile illnesses. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, has occurred in patients taking RILUTEK. Discontinue RILUTEK immediately if interstitial lung disease develops."

        "Drug Interactions There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility. Hepatotoxic Drugs The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Accordingly, there is no information about the safety of administering riluzole in conjunction with such medications. If the practitioner chooses to prescribe such a combination, caution should be exercised. Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Proteins Riluzole is highly bound (96%) to plasma proteins, binding mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. The effect of riluzole (up to 5 mcg/mL) on warfarin (5 mcg/mL) binding did not show any displacement of warfarin. Conversely, riluzole binding was unaffected by the addition of warfarin, digoxin, imipramine and quinine at high therapeutic concentrations. Effect of Other Drugs On Riluzole Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP 1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g., caffeine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline, and quinolones) could decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination. Effect of Riluzole On the Metabolism of Other Drugs CYP 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by CYP 1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole has any potential for enzyme induction in humans."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole more frequently than placebo treated patients were: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia, and somnolence. Asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, somnolence, and circumoral paresthesia were dose related. Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received riluzole in pre-marketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, the rates of discontinuation of riluzole for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT elevation were dose related. Incidence in Controlled ALS Clinical Studies Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients with ALS treated with riluzole (n=794) participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically greater in the patients treated with riluzole 100 mg/day than with placebo or for which a dose response relationship is suggested. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the AE incidences in the population studied.

The overall adverse event profile for riluzole was similar between females and males, and was independent of age. Because the largest non-white racial subgroup was only 2% of patients exposed to riluzole (18/794) in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race. In ALS studies, dizziness did occur more commonly in females (11%) than in males (4%). There was not a difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of riluzole for individual adverse experiences. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Riluzole has been administered to 1713 individuals during all clinical trials, some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 1713 individuals exposed to riluzole who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving riluzole. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "Drug Interactions There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility. Hepatotoxic Drugs The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole more frequently than placebo treated patients were: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia, and somnolence. Asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, somnolence, and circumoral paresthesia were dose related. Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received riluzole in pre-marketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, the rates of discontinuation of riluzole for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT elevation were dose related. Incidence in Controlled ALS Clinical Studies Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients with ALS treated with riluzole (n=794) participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically greater in the patients treated with riluzole 100 mg/day than with placebo or for which a dose response relationship is suggested. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the AE incidences in the population studied.

The overall adverse event profile for riluzole was similar between females and males, and was independent of age. Because the largest non-white racial subgroup was only 2% of patients exposed to riluzole (18/794) in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race. In ALS studies, dizziness did occur more commonly in females (11%) than in males (4%). There was not a difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of riluzole for individual adverse experiences. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Riluzole has been administered to 1713 individuals during all clinical trials, some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 1713 individuals exposed to riluzole who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving riluzole. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.

        "Drug Interactions There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility. Hepatotoxic Drugs The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Accordingly, there is no information about the safety of administering riluzole in conjunction with such medications. If the practitioner chooses to prescribe such a combination, caution should be exercised. Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins Riluzole is highly bound (96%) to plasma proteins, binding mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. The effect of riluzole (up to 5 mcg/mL) on warfarin (5 mcg/mL) binding did not show any displacement of warfarin. Conversely, riluzole binding was unaffected by the addition of warfarin, digoxin, imipramine and quinine at high therapeutic concentrations. Effect of Other Drugs on Riluzole Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP 1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g., caffeine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline, and quinolones) could decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination. Effect of Riluzole on the Metabolism of Other Drugs CYP 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by CYP 1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole has any potential for enzyme induction in humans."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole more frequently than placebo treated patients were: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia, and somnolence. Asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, somnolence, and circumoral paresthesia were dose related. Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received riluzole in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose-response study in ALS patients, the rates of discontinuation of riluzole for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT elevation were dose related. Incidence in Controlled ALS Clinical Studies Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients with ALS treated with riluzole (n = 794) participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically greater in the patients treated with riluzole 100 mg/day than with placebo or for which a dose-response relationship is suggested. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies.

        "Drug Interactions There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility. Hepatotoxic Drugs The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Accordingly, there is no information about the safety of administering riluzole in conjunction with such medications. If the practitioner chooses to prescribe such a combination, caution should be exercised. Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Proteins Riluzole is highly bound (96%) to plasma proteins, binding mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. The effect of riluzole (up to 5 mcg/mL) on warfarin (5 mcg/mL) binding did not show any displacement of warfarin. Conversely, riluzole binding was unaffected by the addition of warfarin, digoxin, imipramine and quinine at high therapeutic concentrations. Effect of Other Drugs On Riluzole Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP 1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g., caffeine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline, and quinolones) could decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination. Effect of Riluzole On the Metabolism of Other Drugs CYP 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by CYP 1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole has any potential for enzyme induction in humans."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole tablets more frequently than placebo treated patients were: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia, and somnolence. Asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, somnolence, and circumoral paresthesia were dose related. Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received riluzole tablets in pre-marketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, the rates of discontinuation of riluzole tablets for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT elevation were dose related. Incidence in Controlled ALS Clinical Studies Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients with ALS treated with riluzole tablets (n=794) participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically greater in the patients treated with riluzole tablets 100 mg/day than with placebo or for which a dose response relationship is suggested. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the AE incidences in the population studied.

The overall adverse event profile for riluzole tablets was similar between females and males, and was independent of age. Because the largest non-white racial subgroup was only 2% of patients exposed to riluzole tablets (18/794) in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race. In ALS studies, dizziness did occur more commonly in females (11%) than in males (4%). There was not a difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of riluzole tablets for individual adverse experiences. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Riluzole tablets has been administered to 1713 individuals during all clinical trials, some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 1713 individuals exposed to riluzole tablets who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving riluzole tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole: Frequent: Hostility= AE frequency <= to placebo .

The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton) with riluzole may increase the risk of riluzole-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Agents that may Decrease Riluzole Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 inducers Co-administration of riluzole (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest a decrease in riluzole exposure is likely. Lower exposures may result in decreased efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Hepatotoxic Drugs Clinical trials in ALS patients excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine).

Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials In the placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with ALS (Study 1 and 2), a total of 313 patients received riluzole 50 mg twice daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The most common adverse reactions in the riluzole group (in at least 5% of patients and more frequently than in the placebo group) were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, and abdominalpain. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the riluzole group were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and elevated ALT. There was no difference in rates of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in females and males. However, the incidence of dizziness was higher in females (11%) than in males (4%). The adverse reaction profile was similar in older and younger patients. There were insufficient data to determine if there were differences in the adverse reaction profile in different races. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of riluzole-treated patients (50 mg twice daily) in pooled Study 1 and 2, and at a higher rate than placebo. Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS · Hepatic injury: Use of riluzole is not recommended in patients with baseline elevations of serum aminotransferases greater than 5 times upper limit of normal; discontinue riluzole if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (5.1) · Neutropenia: Advise patients to report any febrile illness (5.2) · Interstitial lung disease: Discontinue riluzole if interstitial lung disease develops (5.3) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Cases of drug-induced liver injury, some of which were fatal, have been reported in patients taking riluzole. Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases have also been reported, and in some patients have recurred upon rechallenge with riluzole. In clinical studies, the incidence of elevations in hepatic transaminases was greater in riluzole-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. The incidence of elevations of ALT above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2% in riluzole-treated patients. Maximum increases in ALT occurred within 3 months after starting riluzole. About 50% and 8% of riluzole -treated patients in pooled Studies 1 and 2, had at least one elevated ALT level above ULN and above 3 times ULN, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury, every month for the first 3 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. The use of riluzole is not recommended if patients develop hepatic transaminases levels greater than 5 times the ULN. Discontinue riluzole if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (e.g., elevated bilirubin). 5.2 Neutropenia Cases of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil countless than 500 per mm3) within the first 2 months of riluzoletreatment have been reported. Advise patients to report febrile illnesses. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease, including hypersensitivitypneumonitis, has occurred in patients taking riluzole. Discontinue riluzoleimmediately if interstitial lung disease develops."

The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 1713 individuals exposed to RILUTEK who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving RILUTEK. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

The concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton) with riluzole may increase the risk of riluzole-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Agents that may Decrease Riluzole Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 inducers Co-administration of riluzole (a CYP1A substrate) with CYP1A2 inducers was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, in vitro findings suggest a decrease in riluzole exposure is likely. Lower exposures may result in decreased efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Hepatotoxic Drugs Clinical trials in ALS patients excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Riluzole-treated patients who take other hepatotoxic drugs may be at an increased risk for hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: -Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo) were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, and abdominal pain (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1-888-721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials In the placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with ALS (Study 1 and 2), a total of 313 patients received riluzole 50 mg twice daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The most common adverse reactions in the riluzole group (in at least 5% of patients and more frequently than in the placebo group) were asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, and abdominal pain. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the riluzole group were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and elevated ALT. There was no difference in rates of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in females and males. However, the incidence of dizziness was higher in females (11%) than in males (4%). The adverse reaction profile was similar in older and younger patients. There were insufficient data to determine if there were differences in the adverse reaction profile in different races. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of riluzole-treated patients (50 mg twice daily) in pooled Study 1 and 2, and at a higher rate than placebo. Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. -Acute hepatitis and icteric toxic hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Renal tubular impairment"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Click here to enter Warnings and Precautions -Hepatic injury: Use of riluzole is not recommended in patients with baseline elevations of serum aminotransferases greater than 5 times upper limit of normal; discontinue riluzole if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (5.1) -Neutropenia: Advise patients to report any febrile illness (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease: Discontinue riluzole if interstitial lung disease develops (5.3) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Cases of drug-induced liver injury, some of which were fatal, have been reported in patients taking riluzole. Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases have also been reported, and in some patients have recurred upon rechallenge with riluzole. In clinical studies, the incidence of elevations in hepatic transaminases was greater in riluzole-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. The incidence of elevations of ALT above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2% in riluzole-treated patients. Maximum increases in ALT occurred within 3 months after starting riluzole. About 50% and 8% of riluzole-treated patients in pooled Studies 1 and 2, had at least one elevated ALT level above ULN and above 3 times ULN, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury, every month for the first 3 months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. The use of riluzole is not recommended if patients develop hepatic transaminases levels greater than 5 times the ULN. Discontinue riluzole if there is evidence of liver dysfunction (e.g., elevated bilirubin). 5.2 Neutropenia Cases of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per mm3) within the first 2 months of riluzole treatment have been reported. Advise patients to report febrile illnesses. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, has occurred in patients taking riluzole. Discontinue riluzole immediately if interstitial lung disease develops."

        "Drug Interactions There have been no clinical studies designed to evaluate the interaction of riluzole with other drugs. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms is a possibility. Hepatotoxic Drugs: The clinical trials in ALS excluded patients on concomitant medications which were potentially hepatotoxic, (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine). Accordingly, there is no information about the safety of administering Riluzole in conjunction with such medications. If the practitioner chooses to prescribe such a combination, caution should be exercised. Drugs Highly Bound To Plasma Proteins: Riluzole is highly bound (96%) to plasma proteins, binding mainly to serum albumin and to lipoproteins. The effect of riluzole (up to 5 mcg/mL) on warfarin (5 mcg/mL) binding did not show any displacement of warfarin. Conversely, riluzole binding was unaffected by the addition of warfarin, digoxin, imipramine and quinine at high therapeutic concentrations. Effect of Other Drugs On Riluzole Metabolism: In vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations suggest that CYP 1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP 1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP 1A2 (e.g., caffeine, phenacetin, theophylline, amitriptyline, and quinolones) could decrease the rate of riluzole elimination, while inducers of CYP 1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination. Effect of Riluzole On the Metabolism of Other Drugs: CYP 1A2 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by CYP 1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole has any potential for enzyme induction in humans."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of Riluzole more frequently than placebo treated patients were: asthenia, nausea, dizziness, decreased lung function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia, and somnolence. Asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, somnolence, and circumoral paresthesia were dose related. Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received Riluzole in pre-marketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, the rates of discontinuation of Riluzole for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT elevation were dose related. Incidence in Controlled ALS Clinical Studies Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients with ALS treated with Riluzole (n=794) participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically greater in the patients treated with Riluzole 100 mg/day than with placebo or for which a dose response relationship is suggested. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse experiences in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the AE incidences in the population studied.

The overall adverse event profile for Riluzole was similar between females and males, and was independent of age. Because the largest non-white racial subgroup was only 2% of patients exposed to Riluzole (18/794) in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race. In ALS studies, dizziness did occur more commonly in females (11%) than in males (4%). There was not a difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of Riluzole for individual adverse experiences.
