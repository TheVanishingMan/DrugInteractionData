        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. (5.1) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.1) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption. (5.1) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids (5.2, 5.3, 6.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. (5.1, 8.4) 5.1. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, and use of occlusive dressings. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2. Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3. Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4. Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, fluocinolone acetonide topical oil 0.01% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5. Use in Peanut-Sensitive Individuals Physicians should use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% topical oil for peanut-sensitive individuals. [See Description (11) ] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% topical oil should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted."
