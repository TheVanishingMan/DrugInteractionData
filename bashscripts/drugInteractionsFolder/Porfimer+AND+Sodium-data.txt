        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other photosensitizing agents: May increase the risk of photosensitivity reaction (7.1) Concomitant therapy: May decrease the efficacy of PDT (7.2) 7.1 Other Photosensitizing Agents There have been no formal interaction studies of PHOTOFRIN and any other drugs. However, it is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitizing agents (e.g., tetracyclines, sulfonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin, and fluoroquinolones) could increase the risk of photosensitivity reaction. 7.2 Concomitant Therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with PHOTOFRIN causes direct intracellular damage by initiating radical chain reactions that damage intracellular membranes and mitochondria. Tissue damage also results from ischemia secondary to vasoconstriction, platelet activation and aggregation and clotting. Research in animals and in cell culture has suggested that many drugs could influence the effects of PDT, possible examples of which are described below. There are no human data that support or rebut these possibilities. Compounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, β-carotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol would be expected to decrease PDT activity. Preclinical data also suggest that tissue ischemia, allopurinol, calcium channel blockers and some prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors could interfere with PHOTOFRIN PDT. Drugs that decrease clotting, vasoconstriction or platelet aggregation, e.g., thromboxane A2 inhibitors, could decrease the efficacy of PDT. Glucocorticoid hormones given before or concomitant with PDT may decrease the efficacy of the treatment."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (>10% of patients) are (6.2): Esophageal Cancer: Anemia, pleural effusion, pyrexia, constipation, nausea, chest pain, pain, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, photosensitivity reaction, pneumonia, vomiting, insomnia, back pain, pharyngitis Obstructing Endobronchial Cancer: Dyspnoea, photosensitivity reaction, hemoptysis, pyrexia, cough, pneumonia Superficial Endobronchial Tumors: Exudate, photosensitivity reaction, bronchial obstruction, edema, bronchostenosis High-Grade Dysplasia in Barrett’s Esophagus: Photosensitivity reaction, esophageal stenosis, vomiting, chest pain, nausea, pyrexia, constipation, dysphagia, abdominal pain, pleural effusion, dehydration To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pinnacle Biologics, Inc. at 1-866-248-2039 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overall Adverse Reaction Profile Systemically induced effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with PHOTOFRIN consist of photosensitivity and mild constipation. All patients who receive PHOTOFRIN will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid sunlight and bright indoor light [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )]. Photosensitivity reactions occurred in approximately 20% of cancer patients and in 69% of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett’s esophagus (BE) patients treated with PHOTOFRIN. Typically these reactions were mostly mild to moderate erythema but they also included swelling, pruritus, burning sensation, feeling hot, or blisters. In a single study of 24 healthy subjects, some evidence of photosensitivity reactions occurred in all subjects. Other less common skin manifestations were also reported in areas where photosensitivity reactions had occurred, such as increased hair growth, skin discoloration, skin nodule, skin wrinkling and increased skin fragility. These manifestations may be attributable to a pseudoporphyria state (temporary drug-induced cutaneous porphyria). Most toxicities of this therapy are local effects seen in the region of illumination and occasionally in surrounding tissues. The local adverse reactions are characteristic of an inflammatory response induced by the photodynamic effect. A few cases of fluid imbalance have been reported in patients treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT for overtly disseminated intraperitoneal malignancies. Fluid imbalance is an expected PDT-related event. A case of cataracts has been reported in a 51 year-old obese man treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT for HGD in BE. The patient suffered from a PDT response with development of a deep esophageal ulcer. Within two months post PDT, the patient noted difficulty with his distant vision. A thorough eye examination revealed a change in the refractive error that later progressed to cataracts in both eyes. Both of his parents had a history of cataracts in their 70s. Whether PHOTOFRIN directly caused or accelerated a familial underlying condition is unknown. 6.2 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Esophageal Carcinoma The following adverse reactions were reported over the entire follow-up period in at least 5% of patients treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT, who had completely or partially obstructing esophageal cancer. Table 6 presents data from 88 patients who received the currently marketed formulation. The relationship of many of these adverse reactions to PDT with PHOTOFRIN is uncertain. TABLE 6.

Also, patients with large tumors (>10 cm) were more likely to experience anemia. Two of 17 patients with complete esophageal obstruction from tumor experienced esophageal perforations, which were considered to be possibly treatment-associated; these perforations occurred during subsequent endoscopies. Serious and other notable adverse reactions observed in less than 5% of PDT-treated patients with obstructing esophageal cancer in the clinical studies include the following; their relationship to therapy is uncertain. In the gastrointestinal system, esophageal perforation, gastric ulcer, ileus, jaundice, and peritonitis have occurred. Sepsis has been reported occasionally. Cardiovascular reactions have included angina pectoris, bradycardia, myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, and supraventricular tachycardia. Respiratory reactions of bronchitis, bronchospasm, laryngotracheal edema, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and stridor have occurred. The temporal relationship of some gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and respiratory reactions to the administration of light was suggestive of mediastinal inflammation in some patients. Vision-related reactions of abnormal vision, diplopia, eye pain and photophobia have been reported. Obstructing Endobronchial Cancer Table 7 presents adverse reactions that were reported over the entire follow-up period in at least 5% of patients with obstructing endobronchial cancer treated with PHOTOFRIN PDT or Nd:YAG. These data are based on the 86 patients who received the currently marketed formulation. Since it seems likely that most adverse reactions caused by these acute acting therapies would occur within 30 days of treatment, Table 7 presents those reactions occurring within 30 days of a treatment procedure, as well as those occurring over the entire follow-up period. It should be noted that follow-up was 33% longer for the PDT group than for the Nd:YAG group, thereby introducing a bias against PDT when adverse reaction rates are compared for the entire follow-up period. The extent of follow-up in the 30-day period following treatment was comparable between groups (only 9% more for PDT). Transient inflammatory reactions in PDT-treated patients occur in about 10% of patients and manifest as pyrexia, bronchitis, chest pain, and dyspnoea. The incidences of bronchitis and dyspnoea were higher with PDT than with Nd:YAG. Most cases of bronchitis occurred within 1 week of treatment and all but one were mild or moderate in intensity. The reactions usually resolved within 10 days with antibiotic therapy. Treatment-related worsening of dyspnoea is generally transient and self-limiting. Debridement of the treated area is mandatory to remove exudate and necrotic tissue. Life-threatening respiratory insufficiency likely due to therapy occurred in 3% of PDT-treated patients and 2% of Nd:YAG-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. There was a trend toward a higher rate of fatal massive hemoptysis (FMH) occurring on the PDT arm (10%) versus the Nd:YAG arm (5%), however, the rate of FMH occurring within 30 days of treatment was the same for PDT and Nd:YAG (4% total events, 3% treatment-associated events). Patients who have received radiation therapy have a higher incidence of FMH after treatment with PDT and after other forms of local therapy than patients who have not received radiation therapy, but analyses suggest that this increased risk may be due to associated prognostic factors such as having a centrally located tumor. The incidence of FMH in patients previously treated with radiotherapy was 21% (6/29) in the PDT group and 10% (3/29) in the Nd:YAG group. In patients with no prior radiotherapy, the overall incidence of FMH was less than 1%. Characteristics of patients at high risk for FMH are described in Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) . Other serious or notable adverse reactions were observed in less than 5% of PDT-treated patients with endobronchial cancer; their relationship to therapy is uncertain. In the respiratory system, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and lung abscess have occurred. Cardiac failure, sepsis, and possible cerebrovascular accident have also been reported in one patient each. TABLE 7.

The most common reaction to therapy was a mucositis reaction in one-fifth of the patients, which manifested as edema, exudate, and obstruction. The obstruction (mucus plug) is easily removed with suction or forceps. Mucositis can be minimized by avoiding exposure of normal tissue to excessive light [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Three patients experienced life-threatening dyspnoea: one was given a double dose of light, one was treated concurrently in both mainstem bronchi and the other had had prior pneumonectomy and was treated in the sole remaining main airway [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Stent placement was required in 3% of the patients due to endobronchial stricture. Fatal massive hemoptysis occurred within 30 days of treatment in one patient with superficial tumors (1%). High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's Esophagus (BE) Table 9 presents adverse reactions that were reported over the follow-up period in at least 5% of patients with HGD in BE in either controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials. In the PHOTOFRIN PDT + OM group severe adverse reactions included chest pain of non-cardiac origin, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn. The severity of these symptoms decreased within 4 to 6 weeks following treatment. The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred within 90 days following PHOTOFRIN injection and was of mild (68%) or moderate (24%) intensity. Fourteen (10%) patients reported severe reactions, all of which resolved. The typical reaction was described as skin disorder, sunburn or rash, and affected mostly the face, hands, and neck. Associated symptoms and signs were swelling, pruritis, erythema, blisters, burning sensation, and feeling of heat. The majority of esophageal stenosis including strictures reported in the PHOTOFRIN PDT + OM group were of mild (57%) or moderate (35%) intensity, while approximately 8% were of severe intensity. The majority of esophageal strictures were reported during Course 2 of treatment. All esophageal strictures were considered to be due to treatment. Most esophageal strictures were manageable through dilations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )]. Table 9.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistula can occur if esophageal tumor is eroding into trachea or bronchial tree (5.1) Gastrointestinal perforation can occur (5.1) High risk of bleeding in patients with esophageal varices (5.2) High risk for fatal massive hemoptysis with endobronchial tumors that are: large, centrally located; cavitating; extensive, extrinsic to the bronchus (5.2) After treatment of HGD in BE, monitor endoscopic biopsy every three months, until four consecutive negative evaluations for HGD have been recorded (5.3) Photosensitivity can be expected; ocular sensitivity is possible (5.4, 5.5) Allow 2-4 weeks between PDT and subsequent radiotherapy (5.6) Substernal chest pain may occur after treatment (5.7) Treatment induced inflammation can cause airway obstruction. Administer with caution to patients with tumors in locations where treatment-induced inflammation can obstruct the main airway (5.8) Esophageal stenosis occurs frequently after treatment of HGD in BE (5.9) Patients with hepatic or renal impairment may need longer precautionary measures for photosensitivity (5.10) Thromboembolic events can occur following photodynamic therapy with PHOTOFRIN (5.11) 5.1 Gastroesophageal Fistula and Perforation Do not initiate PHOTOFRIN with PDT in patients with esophageal tumors eroding into the trachea or bronchial tree or bronchial wall because of the high likelihood of tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistula. Serious and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal and esophageal necrosis and perforation can occur following treatment with PHOTOFRIN with PDT. 5.2 Pulmonary and Gastroesophageal Hemorrhage Assess patients for tumors eroding into a pulmonary blood vessel [see Contraindications (4)] and esophageal varices. Patients at high risk for fatal massive hemoptysis (FMH) include those with large, centrally located tumors, cavitating tumors or extensive tumors extrinsic to the bronchus. Do not administer light directly to an area with esophageal varices because of the high risk of hemorrhage. 5.3 High-Grade Dysplasia (HGD) in Barrett's Esophagus (BE) The long-term effect of PDT on HGD in BE is unknown. There is always a risk of cancer or abnormal epithelium that is invisible to the endoscopist beneath the new squamous cell epithelium; these facts emphasize the risk of overlooking cancer in such patients and the need for rigorous continuing surveillance despite the endoscopic appearance of complete squamous cell reepithelialization. It is recommended that endoscopic biopsy surveillance be conducted every three months, until four consecutive negative evaluations for HGD have been recorded; further follow-up may be scheduled every 6 to 12 months, as per judgment of physicians. The follow-up period of the randomized study at the time of analysis was a minimum of two years (ranging from 2 to 5.6 years). 5.4 Photosensitivity All patients who receive PHOTOFRIN will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid exposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light (from examination lamps, including dental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity, etc.) for at least 30 days. Some patients may remain photosensitive for up to 90 days or more. The photosensitivity is due to residual drug, which will be present in all parts of the skin. Exposure of the skin to ambient indoor light is, however, beneficial because the remaining drug will be inactivated gradually and safely through a photobleaching reaction. Therefore, patients should not stay in a darkened room during this period and should be encouraged to expose their skin to ambient indoor light. The level of photosensitivity will vary for different areas of the body, depending on the extent of previous exposure to light. Before exposing any area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light, the patient should test it for residual photosensitivity. A small area of skin should be exposed to sunlight for 10 minutes. If no photosensitivity reaction (erythema, edema, blistering) occurs within 24 hours, the patient can gradually resume normal outdoor activities, initially continuing to exercise caution and gradually allowing increased exposure. If some photosensitivity reaction occurs with the limited skin test, the patient should continue precautions for another 2 weeks before retesting. The tissue around the eyes may be more sensitive, and therefore, it is not recommended that the face be used for testing. If patients travel to a different geographical area with greater sunshine, they should retest their level of photosensitivity. Conventional ultraviolet (UV) sunscreens will only protect against UV light-related photosensitivity and will be of no value in protecting against induced photosensitivity reactions caused by visible light. 5.5 Ocular Sensitivity Sensitivity to sun, bright lights, or car headlights, causing ocular discomfort, can occur in patients who receive PHOTOFRIN. For at least 30 days and until ocular sensitivity resolves, instruct patients when outdoors to wear dark sunglasses which have an average white light transmittance of <4%. 5.6 Use Before or After Radiotherapy If PDT is to be used before or after radiotherapy, sufficient time should be allotted between the two therapies to ensure that the inflammatory response produced by the first treatment has subsided before commencing the second treatment. The inflammatory response from PDT will depend on tumor size and extent of surrounding normal tissue that receives light. It is recommended that 2 to 4 weeks be allowed after PDT before commencing radiotherapy. Similarly, if PDT is to be given after radiotherapy, the acute inflammatory reaction from radiotherapy usually subsides within 4 weeks after completing radiotherapy, after which PDT may be given. 5.7 Chest Pain As a result of PDT treatment, patients may complain of substernal chest pain because of inflammatory responses within the area of treatment. Such pain may be of sufficient intensity to warrant the short-term prescription of opiate analgesics. 5.8 Airway Obstruction and Respiratory Distress Photofrin followed by PDT can cause treatment-induced inflammation and obstruct the main airway. Administer with caution to patients with endobronchial tumors in locations where treatment-induced inflammation can obstruct the main airway, e.g., long or circumferential tumors of the trachea, tumors of the carina that involve both mainstreatm bronchi circumferentially, or circumferential tumors in the mainstream bronchus in patients with prior pneumonectomy. Monitor patients closely between laser light therapy and the mandatory debridement bronchoscopy for any evidence of respiratory distress. Inflammation, mucositis, and necrotic debris may cause obstruction of the airway. If respiratory distress occurs, the physician should be prepared to carry out immediate bronchoscopy to remove secretions and debris to open the airway. 5.9 Esophageal Strictures Esophageal strictures occurred in 122 of 318 (38%) patients enrolled in three clinical studies of patients who received PHOTOFRIN with PDT to the esophagus. Nodule pretreatment and re-treating the same mucosal segment more than once may influence the risk of developing an esophageal stricture. A total of 49% of patients who developed a stricture received nodule pretreatment and 82% who developed a stricture had a mucosal segment treated twice. Overall, esophageal strictures occurred within six months following PHOTOFRIN with PDT. Multiple dilations of esophageal strictures may be required, as shown in Table 5 . 5.10 Hepatic and Renal Impairment Hepatic or Renal impairment will likely prolong the elimination of porfimer sodium leading to higher rates of toxicity. Patients with severe renal impairment or mild to severe hepatic impairment should be clearly informed that the period requiring the precautionary measures for photosensitivity may be longer than 90 days. TABLE 5. Esophageal Dilations in Patients with Treatment-Related Strictures Number of Dilations Number of Patients with Strictures N=114 Percentage of Patients with Strictures 1 − 2 Dilations 32 28% 3 − 5 Dilations 32 28% 6 − 10 Dilations 24 21% >10 Dilations 26 23% 5.11 Thromboembolism Thromboembolic events can occur following photodynamic therapy with PHOTOFRIN. Most reported events occurred in patients with other risk factors for thromboembolism including advanced cancer, following major surgery, prolonged immobilization, or cardiovascular disease."
