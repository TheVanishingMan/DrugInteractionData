        "Drug Interactions Formal interaction studies of TNKase with other drugs have not been performed. Patients studied in clinical trials of TNKase were routinely treated with heparin and aspirin. Anticoagulants (such as heparin and vitamin K antagonists) and drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after TNKase therapy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Bleeding The most frequent adverse reaction associated with TNKase is bleeding (see WARNINGS). Should serious bleeding occur, concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. Death or permanent disability can occur in patients who experience stroke or serious bleeding episodes. For TNKase-treated patients in ASSENT-2, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.9% and any stroke was 1.8%. The incidence of all strokes, including intracranial bleeding, increases with increasing age (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use). In the ASSENT-2 study, the following bleeding events were reported (see Table 3). Table 3 ASSENT-2 Non-ICH Bleeding Events TNKase (n = 8461) Accelerated Activase (n = 8488) Relative Risk for TNKase/Activase (95% CI) Major bleedingMajor bleeding is defined as bleeding requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic compromise. 4.7% 5.9% 0.78 (0.69, 0.89) Minor bleeding 21.8% 23.0% 0.94 (0.89, 1.00) Units of transfused blood Any 4.3% 5.5% 0.77 (0.67, 0.89) 1-2 2.6% 3.2% >2 1.7% 2.2% Non-intracranial major bleeding and the need for blood transfusions were lower in patients treated with TNKase. Types of major bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (1.7%) and gastrointestinal tract (1%). Types of major bleeding reported in less than 1% of the patients were urinary tract, puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site), retroperitoneal, respiratory tract, and unspecified. Types of minor bleeding reported in 1% or more of the patients were hematoma (12.3%), urinary tract (3.7%), puncture site (including cardiac catheterization site) (3.6%), pharyngeal (3.1%), gastrointestinal tract (1.9%), epistaxis (1.5%), and unspecified (1.3%). Allergic Reactions Allergic-type reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and urticaria) have rarely (< 1%) been reported in patients treated with TNKase. Anaphylaxis was reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with TNKase; however, causality was not established. When such reactions occur, they usually respond to conventional therapy. Other Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions have been reported among patients receiving TNKase in clinical trials. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of TNKase on the incidence of these events is unknown. These events include cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, pulmonary edema, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent myocardial ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, thrombosis, embolism, and electromechanical dissociation. These events can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting, hypotension, and fever have also been reported."
