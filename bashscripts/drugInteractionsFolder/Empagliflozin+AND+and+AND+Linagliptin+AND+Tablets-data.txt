        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion: May reduce metformin elimination. Use with caution. (7.2) 7.1 Drug Interactions with Empagliflozin Diuretics Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Positive Urine Glucose Test Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. 7.2 Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Cationic Drugs Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of SYNJARDY and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently decrease serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs may induce metabolic acidosis. Use these drugs with caution in patients treated with SYNJARDY, as the risk of lactic acidosis may increase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving SYNJARDY, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving SYNJARDY, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.6, 5.10, 5.11)] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Impairment in Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Impaired Hepatic Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Genital Mycotic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] Most common adverse reactions associated with empagliflozin (5% or greater incidence) were urinary tract infection and female genital mycotic infections. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions associated with metformin (>5%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or 1-800-459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin (daily dose 10 mg and 25 mg) and metformin (mean daily dose of approximately 1800 mg) has been evaluated in 3456 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 16 to 24 weeks, of which 926 patients received placebo, 1271 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1259 patients received a daily dose of empagliflozin 25 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events across treatment groups was 3.0%, 2.8%, and 2.9% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin, there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo. Empagliflozin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin and Sulfonylurea In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin and sulfonylurea, adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥5% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo are presented in Table 1 (see also Table 4). Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥5% of Patients Treated with Empagliflozin added on to Metformin plus Sulfonylurea and Greater than with Placebo in a 24-week Placebo Controlled Clinical Study Number (%) of Patients Placebo n=225 Empagliflozin 10 mg n=224 Empagliflozin 25 mg n=217 Hypoglycemia 22 (9.8) 35 (15.6) 28 (12.9) Urinary tract infection 15 (6.7) 21 (9.4) 15 (6.9) Nasopharyngitis 11 (4.9) 18 (8.0) 13 (6.0) Empagliflozin The data in Table 2 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin. Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to empagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=995), empagliflozin 10 mg (N=999), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N=977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%. Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m2). Table 2 shows common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) associated with the use of empagliflozin. The adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on empagliflozin than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 25 mg. Table 2 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥2% of Patients Treated with Empagliflozin and Greater than Placebo in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Empagliflozin Monotherapy or Combination Therapy aPredefined adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis bFemale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, genital infection, genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, genitourinary tract infection, vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, urogenital infection fungal, vaginitis bacterial. Percentages calculated with the number of female subjects in each group as denominator: placebo (N=481), empagliflozin 10 mg (N=443), empagliflozin 25 mg (N=420). cPredefined adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia dMale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: balanoposthitis, balanitis, genital infections fungal, genitourinary tract infection, balanitis candida, scrotal abscess, penile infection.

Volume Depletion Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Increased Urination In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on empagliflozin than on placebo (see Table 3). Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Impairment in Renal Function Use of empagliflozin was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 3). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Table 3 Changes from Baseline in Serum Creatinine and eGFR in the Pool of Four 24-week Placebo-Controlled Studies and Renal Impairment Study aSubset of patients from renal impairment study with eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. bApproximately 3 weeks after end of treatment.

The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when empagliflozin was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg. Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 2). Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and empagliflozin 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%). Urinary Tract Infections In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo (see Table 2). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Metformin hydrochloride The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Laboratory Tests Empagliflozin Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increase in Hematocrit: In a pool of four placebo-controlled studies, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Metformin hydrochloride In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks’ duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum Vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or Vitamin B12 supplementation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of empagliflozin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis: Warn against excessive alcohol use. SYNJARDY is not recommended in hepatic impairment or hypoxic states and is contraindicated in renal impairment. Ensure normal renal function before initiating and at least annually thereafter. (5.1, 5.4, 5.6, 5.10, 5.11) Hypotension: Before initiating SYNJARDY assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (5.2) Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue SYNJARDY, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating SYNJARDY, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on SYNJARDY may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. (5.3) Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy. (5.4) Radiological studies and surgical procedures: Temporarily discontinue SYNJARDY in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. (5.4) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (5.5) Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating SYNJARDY (5.7) Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.8) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually. (5.9) Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.12) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with SYNJARDY. (5.13) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with SYNJARDY and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of >5 µg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient’s age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The onset of lactic acidosis is often subtle, and accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. More severe acidosis may be associated with signs such as hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Patients should be educated to recognize and promptly report these symptoms. If present, SYNJARDY should be discontinued until lactic acidosis is ruled out. Gastrointestinal symptoms, which are commonly reported during initiation of metformin therapy are less frequently observed in subjects on a chronic, stable, dose of metformin. Gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects on chronic, stable, dose of metformin could be caused by lactic acidosis or other serious disease. To rule out lactic acidosis, serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be due to other mechanisms, such as poorly-controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and supportive measures promptly instituted. Metformin is dialyzable (clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions) and prompt hemodialysis is recommended to remove the accumulated metformin and correct the metabolic acidosis. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Hypotension Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating empagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating SYNJARDY, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin. SYNJARDY is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients treated with SYNJARDY who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with SYNJARDY may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, SYNJARDY should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement. In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified. Before initiating SYNJARDY, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with SYNJARDY consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing SYNJARDY in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). 5.4 Impairment in Renal Function Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of impaired renal function with empagliflozin is increased in elderly patients and patients with moderate renal impairment. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, SYNJARDY is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL for males or 1.4 mg/dL for females, or eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Before initiation of therapy with SYNJARDY and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified to be normal. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g., elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently and SYNJARDY discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present (serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL for males or 1.4 mg/dL for females, or eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Use of concomitant medications that may affect renal function or metformin disposition: Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or interfere with the disposition of metformin should be used with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Radiological studies and surgical procedures: Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (e.g., intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, SYNJARDY should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been confirmed to be normal. SYNJARDY should be temporarily discontinued for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient’s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. 5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Impaired Hepatic Function Because impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis with metformin therapy, SYNJARDY should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.7 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Empagliflozin Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when empagliflozin is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with SYNJARDY. Metformin hydrochloride Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as SUs and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking β-adrenergic blocking drugs. Monitor for a need to lower the dose of SYNJARDY to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients. 5.8 Genital Mycotic Infections Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.9 Vitamin B12 Levels In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (<1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin, and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on SYNJARDY and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful. 5.10 Alcohol Intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving SYNJARDY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.11 Hypoxic States Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause (e.g., acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia) have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on SYNJARDY therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.12 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Increases in LDL-C can occur with empagliflozin. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.13 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with SYNJARDY, or any other antidiabetic drug."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug Interactions with Empagliflozin Diuretics Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Positive Urine Glucose Test Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. 7.2 Drug Interactions with Linagliptin Inducers of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 Enzymes Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of linagliptin may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer. Therefore, use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions associated with GLYXAMBI (a 5% or greater incidence) were urinary tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or 1-800-459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Empagliflozin and Linagliptin The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin (daily dose 10 mg or 25 mg) and linagliptin (daily dose 5 mg) has been evaluated in a total of 1363 patients with type 2 diabetes treated for up to 52 weeks in active-controlled clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions with concomitant administration of empagliflozin and linagliptin based on a pooled analyses of these studies are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥5% of Patients Treated with Empagliflozin and Linagliptin aPredefined adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg n=272 GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg n=273 n (%) n (%) Urinary tract infectiona 34 (12.5) 31 (11.4) Nasopharyngitis 16 (5.9) 18 (6.6) Upper respiratory tract infection 19 (7.0) 19 (7.0) Empagliflozin Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of patients receiving empagliflozin and more commonly than in patients given placebo included (10 mg, 25 mg, and placebo): urinary tract infection (9.3%, 7.6%, and 7.6%), female genital mycotic infections (5.4%, 6.4%, and 1.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.1%, 4.0%, and 3.8%), increased urination (3.4%, 3.2%, and 1.0%), dyslipidemia (3.9%, 2.9%, and 3.4%), arthralgia (2.4%, 2.3%, and 2.2%), male genital mycotic infections (3.1%, 1.6%, and 0.4%), and nausea (2.3%, 1.1%, and 1.4%). Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. Linagliptin Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included: nasopharyngitis (7.0% and 6.1%), diarrhea (3.3% and 3.0%), and cough (2.1% and 1.4%). Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin monotherapy were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin. Hypoglycemia Table 2 summarizes the reports of hypoglycemia with empagliflozin and linagliptin over a treatment period of 52 weeks. Table 2 Incidence of Overalla and Severeb Hypoglycemic Adverse Reactions aOverall hypoglycemic events: plasma or capillary glucose of less than or equal to 70 mg/dL or requiring assistance bSevere hypoglycemic events: requiring assistance regardless of blood glucose Add-on to Metformin (52 weeks) GLYXAMBI 10 mg/5 mg n=136 GLYXAMBI 25 mg/5 mg n=137 Overall (%) 2.2% 3.6% Severe (%) 0% 0% Laboratory Tests Empagliflozin and Linagliptin Changes in laboratory findings in patients treated with the combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin included increases in cholesterol and hematocrit compared to baseline. Empagliflozin Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C): Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increase in Hematocrit: Median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Linagliptin Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the linagliptin group and ≥1% more than in the placebo group were increases in uric acid (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the linagliptin group). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of linagliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Severe and disabling arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Rash"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue GLYXAMBI. (5.1) Hypotension: Before initiating GLYXAMBI assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (5.2) Impairment in Renal Function: Monitor renal function during therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating GLYXAMBI. (5.4) Genital Mycotic Infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.5) Urinary Tract Infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.6) Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin (one of the components of GLYXAMBI) including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. In such cases, promptly discontinue GLYXAMBI, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.7) Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.8) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (5.9) Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLYXAMBI or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.10) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients taking linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue GLYXAMBI and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using GLYXAMBI. 5.2 Hypotension Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating empagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating GLYXAMBI, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Impairment in Renal Function Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. The risk of impaired renal function with empagliflozin is increased in elderly patients and patients with moderate renal impairment. More frequent monitoring of renal function is recommended in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating GLYXAMBI and periodically thereafter. 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of empagliflozin or linagliptin in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI. 5.5 Genital Mycotic Infections Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.6 Urinary Tract Infections Empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin (one of the components of GLYXAMBI). These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with linagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue GLYXAMBI, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with GLYXAMBI. 5.8 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Increases in LDL-C can occur with empagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.9 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.10 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLYXAMBI or any other antidiabetic drug."

Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials evaluating JARDIANCE 10 and 25 mg The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with insulin. JARDIANCE was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to JARDIANCE with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=995), JARDIANCE 10 mg (N=999), or JARDIANCE 25 mg (N=977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%. Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), or neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients (mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m2). Table 1 shows common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) associated with the use of JARDIANCE. The adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on JARDIANCE than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg or JARDIANCE 25 mg. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥2% of Patients Treated with JARDIANCE and Greater than Placebo in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of JARDIANCE Monotherapy or Combination Therapy aPredefined adverse event grouping, including, but not limited to, urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis bFemale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, genital infection, genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, genitourinary tract infection, vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, urogenital infection fungal, vaginitis bacterial.

Volume Depletion JARDIANCE causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., blood pressure (ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) were reported by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg respectively. JARDIANCE may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Increased Urination In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia) occurred more frequently on JARDIANCE than on placebo (see Table 1). Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. Impairment in Renal Function Use of JARDIANCE was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR (see Table 2). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either JARDIANCE 10 or 25 mg. Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients (see Table 1). Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg (less than 0.1%) and JARDIANCE 25 mg (0.1%) than placebo (0%). Urinary Tract Infections In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo (see Table 1). Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.1% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Laboratory Tests Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in patients treated with JARDIANCE. LDL-C increased by 2.3%, 4.6%, and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increase in Hematocrit In a pool of four placebo-controlled studies, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in JARDIANCE 10 mg and 2.8% in JARDIANCE 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6%, 2.7%, and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JARDIANCE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Before initiating JARDIANCE assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (5.1) Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue JARDIANCE, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on JARDIANCE may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. (5.2) Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.3) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (5.4) Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating JARDIANCE (5.5) Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.6) Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate (5.7) Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JARDIANCE (5.8) 5.1 Hypotension JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating JARDIANCE, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.2 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. JARDIANCE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIANCE may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, JARDIANCE should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement. In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified. Before initiating JARDIANCE, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with JARDIANCE consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). 5.3 Impairment in Renal Function JARDIANCE increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of impaired renal function with JARDIANCE is increased in elderly patients and patients with moderate renal impairment. More frequent monitoring of renal function is recommended in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6)]. Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating JARDIANCE and periodically thereafter. 5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including JARDIANCE. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JARDIANCE. 5.6 Genital Mycotic Infections JARDIANCE increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.7 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Increases in LDL-C can occur with JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat as appropriate. 5.8 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JARDIANCE or any other antidiabetic drug."
