        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co–administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Table 5 Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours in healthy adult subjects (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1). Other adverse reactions have been reported. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. Table 1 Adverse reactions in subjects aged 12 years and older reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in the United States Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine capsules at rates of greater than 1% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=680) Placebo Twice Daily (n=674) Frequency Frequency Dysmenorrhea 1.5% 0.3% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=283) Placebo (n=293) Frequency Frequency Headache 10.3% 7.2% Back Pain 2.5% 1.4% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory abnormalities were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Pediatrics: Table 2 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 6 years to 11 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in the United States and Canada. Table 2 Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to 11 years in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily (n=209) Placebo (n=229) Frequency Frequency Cough 3.8% 1.3% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 2.9% 0.9% Pyrexia 2.4% 0.9% Otitis Media 2.4% 0.0% Table 3 lists adverse reactions in subjects 6 months to 5 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride in 3 open single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies and 3 placebo-controlled safety studies with fexofenadine hydrochloride capsule content (484 subjects) and suspension (50 subjects) at doses of 15 mg (108 subjects) and 30 mg (426 subjects) given twice a day. Table 3 Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled studies in pediatric subjects with allergic rhinitis aged 6 months to 5 years of age at rates greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 15 mg Twice Daily Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily Fexofenadine Total Twice Daily Placebo (n=108) Frequency (n=426) Frequency (n=534) Frequency (n=430) Frequency Vomiting 12.0% 4.2% 5.8% 8.6% Diarrhea 3.7% 2.8% 3.0% 2.6% Somnolence/Fatigue 2.8% 0.9% 1.3% 0.2% Rhinorrhea 0.9% 2.1% 1.9% 0.9% Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Adverse reactions reported by subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies were similar to those reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. In placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria clinical trials, 726 subjects 12 years of age and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily. Table 4 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 12 years and older which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg tablets twice daily in controlled clinical studies in the United States and Canada. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 167 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg tablets. Table 4 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. Table 4 Adverse reactions reported in subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in studies in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=191) Frequency Placebo (n=183) Frequency Dizziness 2.1% 1.1% Back Pain 2.1% 1.1% Stomach discomfort 2.1% 0.6% Pain in extremity 2.1% 0.0% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in a study in the United States at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=167) Frequency Placebo (n=92) Frequency Headache 4.8% 3.3% The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 months to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies and listed above, the following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of fexofenadine hydrochloride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co-administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose) was co-administered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table. Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Co-Administration with Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in Healthy Volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug Cmax SS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCSS(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS). Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR In one clinical trial (n=651) in which 215 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis received the 60 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride/120 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination tablet twice daily for up to 2 weeks, adverse events were similar to those reported either in subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg alone (n=218 subjects) or in subjects receiving pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 120 mg alone (n=218). A placebo group was not included in this study. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 3.7% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination group, 0.5% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride group, and 4.1% for the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride group. All adverse events that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination are listed in the following table.

Fexofenadine Hydrochloride In placebo-controlled clinical trials, which included 2461 subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride and placebo-treated subjects. The incidence of adverse events, including drowsiness, was not dose related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 2.2% with fexofenadine hydrochloride vs 3.3% with placebo. Events that have been reported during controlled clinical trials involving subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria at incidences less than 1% and similar to placebo and have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance include: insomnia, nervousness, and sleep disorders or paroniria. In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported. Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity, cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic colitis have been reported. Sympathomimetic drugs have also been associated with other untoward effects such as fear, anxiety, tenseness, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, and cardiovascular collapse."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, coadministration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was coadministered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n = 24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Table 5: Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Coadministration With Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours in Healthy Adult Subjects (n = 24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin coadministration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1) Other adverse reactions have been reported. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at tel: 1-888-838-2872, X6351 and drug.safety@tevausa.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Subjects Aged 12 Years and Older Reported in Placebo-Controlled Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Trials in the United States Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine capsules at rates of greater than 1% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n = 680) Frequency Placebo Twice Daily (n = 674) Frequency Dysmenorrhea 1.5% 0.3% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n = 283) Frequency Placebo (n = 293) Frequency Headache 10.3% 7.2% Back Pain 2.5% 1.4% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory abnormalities were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Pediatrics: Table 2 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 6 years to 11 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in the United States and Canada. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in Placebo-Controlled Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Studies in Pediatric Subjects Aged 6 Years to 11 Years in the United States and Canada at Rates of Greater Than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily (n = 209) Frequency Placebo (n = 229) Frequency Cough 3.8% 1.3% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 2.9% 0.9% Pyrexia 2.4% 0.9% Otitis Media 2.4% 0.0% Table 3 lists adverse reactions in subjects 6 months to 5 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride in 3 open single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies and 3 placebo-controlled safety studies with fexofenadine hydrochloride capsule content (484 subjects) and suspension (50 subjects) at doses of 15 mg (108 subjects) and 30 mg (426 subjects) given twice a day. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Subjects With Allergic Rhinitis Aged 6 Months to 5 Years of Age at Rates Greater Than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 15 mg Twice Daily (n = 108) Frequency Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily (n = 426) Frequency Fexofenadine Total Twice Daily (n = 534) Frequency Placebo (n = 430) Frequency Vomiting 12.0% 4.2% 5.8% 8.6% Diarrhea 3.7% 2.8% 3.0% 2.6% Somnolence/Fatigue 2.8% 0.9% 1.3% 0.2% Rhinorrhea 0.9% 2.1% 1.9% 0.9% Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Adverse reactions reported by subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies were similar to those reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. In placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria clinical trials, 726 subjects 12 years of age and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily. Table 4 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 12 years and older which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg tablets twice daily in controlled clinical studies in the United States and Canada. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 167 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg tablets. Table 4 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older in Placebo-Controlled Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Studies Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in studies in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n = 191) Frequency Placebo (n = 183) Frequency Dizziness 2.1% 1.1% Back Pain 2.1% 1.1% Stomach discomfort 2.1% 0.6% Pain in extremity 2.1% 0.0% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in a study in the United States at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n = 167) Frequency Placebo (n = 92) Frequency Headache 4.8% 3.3% The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 months to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies and listed above, the following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of fexofenadine hydrochloride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table. Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Co-Administration with Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in Healthy Volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug Cmax SS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCSS(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS). Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR In one clinical trial (n=651) in which 215 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis received the 60 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride/120 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination tablet twice daily for up to 2 weeks, adverse events were similar to those reported either in subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg alone (n=218 subjects) or in subjects receiving pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 120 mg alone (n=218). A placebo group was not included in this study. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 3.7% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination group, 0.5% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride group, and 4.1% for the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride group. All adverse events that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination are listed in the following table. Adverse Experiences Reported in One Active-Controlled Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Trial at Rates of Greater than 1% Adverse Experience 60 mg Fexofenadine Hydrochloride/120 mg Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Combination Tablet Twice Daily (n=215) Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 60 mg Twice Daily (n=218) Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride 120 mg Twice Daily (n=218) Headache 13.0% 11.5% 17.4% Insomnia 12.6% 3.2% 13.3% Nausea 7.4% 0.5% 5.0% Dry Mouth 2.8% 0.5% 5.5% Dyspepsia 2.8% 0.5% 0.9% Throat Irritation 2.3% 1.8% 0.5% Dizziness 1.9% 0.0% 3.2% Agitation 1.9% 0.0% 1.4% Back Pain 1.9% 0.5% 0.5% Palpitation 1.9% 0.0% 0.9% Nervousness 1.4% 0.5% 1.8% Anxiety 1.4% 0.0% 1.4% Upper Respiratory Infection 1.4% 0.9% 0.9% Abdominal Pain 1.4% 0.5% 0.5% Many of the adverse events occurring in the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination group were adverse events also reported predominately in the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride group, such as insomnia, headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, agitation, nervousness, anxiety, and palpitation. Fexofenadine Hydrochloride In placebo-controlled clinical trials, which included 2461 subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride and placebo-treated subjects. The incidence of adverse events, including drowsiness, was not dose related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 2.2% with fexofenadine hydrochloride vs 3.3% with placebo. Events that have been reported during controlled clinical trials involving subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria at incidences less than 1% and similar to placebo and have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance include: insomnia, nervousness, and sleep disorders or paroniria. In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported. Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity, cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic colitis have been reported. Sympathomimetic drugs have also been associated with other untoward effects such as fear, anxiety, tenseness, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, and cardiovascular collapse."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co-administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose) was co-administered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table. Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Co-Administration with Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in Healthy Volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug Cmax SS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCSS(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see Warnings). Drug Interactions with AntacidsAdministration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. Interactions with Fruit JuicesFruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR should be taken with water (See Dosage and Administration). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityThere are no animal or in vitro studies on the combination product fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity of fexofenadine hydrochloride were assessed using terfenadine studies with adequate fexofenadine exposure (area-under-the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC]). No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed when mice and rats were given daily oral doses up to 150 mg/kg of terfenadine for 18 and 24 months, respectively. In both species, 150 mg/kg of terfenadine produced AUC values of fexofenadine that were approximately 3 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. Two-year feeding studies in rats and mice conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic potential with ephedrine sulfate, a structurally related drug with pharmacological properties similar to pseudoephedrine, at doses up to 10 and 27 mg/kg, respectively (less than the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride on a mg/m2 basis). In in vitro (Bacterial Reverse Mutation, CHO/HGPRT Forward Mutation, and Rat Lymphocyte Chromosomal Aberration assays) and in vivo (Mouse Bone Marrow Micronucleus assay) tests, fexofenadine hydrochloride revealed no evidence of mutagenicity. Reproduction and fertility studies with terfenadine in rats producedno effect on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day. However, reduced implants and post implantation losses were reported at 300 mg/kg. A reduction in implants was also observed at an oral dose of 150 mg/kg/day. Oral doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg of terfenadine produced AUC values of fexofenadine that were approximately 4 times the AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. In mice, fexofenadine produced no effect on male or female fertility at average dietary doses up to 4438 mg/kg (approximately 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs). Pregnancy Teratogenic EffectsCategory C. Terfenadine alone was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg; 300 mg/kg of terfenadine produced fexofenadine AUC values that were approximately 4 and 30 times, respectively, the AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. In mice, no adverse effects and no teratogenic effects during gestation were observed with fexofenadine at dietary doses up to 3730 mg/kg (approximately 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs). The combination of terfenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in a ratio of 1:2 by weight was studied in rats and rabbits. In rats, an oral combination dose of 150/300 mg/kg produced reduced fetal weight and delayed ossification with a finding of wavy ribs. The dose of 150 mg/kg of terfenadine in rats produced an AUC value of fexofenadine that was approximately 4 times the AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. The dose of 300 mg/kg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in rats was approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR on a mg/m2 basis. In rabbits, an oral combination dose of 100/200 mg/kg produced decreased fetal weight. By extrapolation, the AUC of fexofenadine for 100 mg/kg orally of terfenadine was approximately 10 times the AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. The dose of 200 mg/kg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR on a mg/m2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic EffectsDose-related decreases in pup weight gain and survival were observed in rats exposed to an oral dose of 150 mg/kg of terfenadine; this dose produced an AUC of fexofenadine that was approximately 4 times the AUC at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR. Nursing MothersIt is not known if fexofenadine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be used when fexofenadine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride administered alone distributes into breast milk of lactating human females. Pseudoephedrine concentrations in milk are consistently higher than those in plasma. The total amount of drug in milk as judged by AUC is 2 to 3 times greater than the plasma AUC. The fraction of a pseudoephedrine dose excreted in milk is estimated to be 0.4% to 0.7%. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Caution should be exercised when ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is administered to nursing women. Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR in children below the age of 12 years have not been established. In addition, the doses of the individual components in ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR exceed the recommended individual doses for pediatric patients under 12 years of age. ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is not recommended for pediatric patients under 12 years of age. Geriatric UseClinical studies of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects, although the elderly are more likely to have adverse reactions to sympathomimetic amines. The pseudoephedrine component of ALLEGRA-D 12 HOUR is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co–administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Table 5 Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours in healthy adult subjects (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1). Other adverse reactions have been reported.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, which included 2461 subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. All adverse events that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily), and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo, are listed in Table 1. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, which included 570 subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Table 1 also lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. The incidence of adverse events, including drowsiness, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

In general, fexofenadine hydrochloride was well tolerated in these studies. No unexpected adverse events were seen given the known safety profile of fexofenadine and likely adverse reactions for this patient population. (See PRECAUTIONS Pediatric Use.) Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Adverse events reported by subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies were similar to those reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. In placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria clinical trials, which included 726 subjects 12 years of age and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated patients. Table 3 lists adverse experiences in subjects aged 12 years and older which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg tablets twice daily in controlled clinical studies in the United States and Canada and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, which included 167 subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg tablets, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Table 3 also lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and adolescent patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose (see Pediatric Use).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, coadministration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was coadministered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n = 24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Table 5: Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Coadministration With Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours in Healthy Adult Subjects (n = 24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin coadministration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1) Other adverse reactions have been reported.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older in Placebo-Controlled Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Studies Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in studies in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n = 191) Frequency Placebo (n = 183) Frequency Dizziness 2.1% 1.1% Back Pain 2.1% 1.1% Stomach discomfort 2.1% 0.6% Pain in extremity 2.1% 0.0% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in a study in the United States at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n = 167) Frequency Placebo (n = 92) Frequency Headache 4.8% 3.3% The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 months to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies and listed above, the following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of fexofenadine hydrochloride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co-administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in healthy volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS). Drug Interactions with AntacidsAdministration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. Interactions with Fruit JuicesFruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the bioequivalence study data, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should be taken with water (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fexofenadine Hydrochloride In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, which included 570 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 12 years and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride and placebo-treated subjects. The following table lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. Once daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at rates of greater than 2% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 180 mg once daily (n=283) Placebo (n=293) Headache 10.6% 7.5% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3.2% 3.1% Back Pain 2.8% 1.4% Events that have been reported during controlled clinical trials involving subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis at incidences less than 1% and similar to placebo and have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance include: insomnia, nervousness, and sleep disorders or paroniria. In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported. Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity, cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic colitis have been reported. Sympathomimetic drugs have also been associated with other untoward effects such as fear, anxiety, tenseness, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, and cardiovascular collapse."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS Sympathomimetic amines should be used with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, renal impairment, or prostatic hypertrophy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Sympathomimetic amines may produce central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension. PRECAUTIONS GeneralBecause ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination that cannot be titrated and renal insufficiency increases the bioavailability and prolongs the half-life of fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR tablets should generally be avoided in patients with renal insufficiency (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Information for Patients Patients taking ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR tablets should receive the following information: ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR tablets are prescribed for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients should be instructed to take ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR tablets only as prescribed. Do not exceed the recommended dose. If nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occur, discontinue use and consult the doctor. Patients should also be advised against the concurrent use of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR tablets with over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants. The product should not be used by patients who are hypersensitive to it or to any of its ingredients. Due to its pseudoephedrine component, this product should not be used by patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or by patients receiving a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping use of MAO inhibitor. It also should not be used by patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease. Patients should be told that this product should be used in pregnancy or lactation only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus or nursing infant. Patients should be advised to take the tablet on an empty stomach with water. Patients should be directed to swallow the tablet whole. Patients should be cautioned not to break or chew the tablet. Patients should also be instructed to store the medication in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place, away from children.

Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should be taken with water (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There are no animal or in vitro studies on the combination product fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity of fexofenadine hydrochloride were assessed using terfenadine studies with adequate fexofenadine exposure (area-under-the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC]). No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed when mice and rats were given daily oral doses up to 150 mg/kg of terfenadine for 18 and 24 months, respectively. In both species, 150 mg/kg of terfenadine produced AUC values of fexofenadine that were approximately 2 and 3 times, respectively, the exposure from the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR. Two-year feeding studies in rats and mice conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic potential with ephedrine sulfate, a structurally related drug with pharmacological properties similar to pseudoephedrine, at doses up to 10 and 27 mg/kg, respectively (less than the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride on a mg/m2 basis). In in vitro (Bacterial Reverse Mutation, CHO/HGPRT Forward Mutation, and Rat Lymphocyte Chromosomal Aberration assays) and in vivo (Mouse Bone Marrow Micronucleus assay) tests, fexofenadine hydrochloride revealed no evidence of mutagenicity. Reproduction and fertility studies with terfenadine in rats produced no effect on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs of fexofenadine). However, reduced implants and post-implantation losses were reported at 300 mg/kg. A reduction in implants was also observed at an oral dose of 150 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs). In mice, fexofenadine produced no effect on male or female fertility at average dietary doses up to 4438 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category C Terfenadine alone was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs of fexofenadine) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 300 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs of fexofenadine). In mice, no adverse effects and no teratogenic effects during gestation were observed with fexofenadine at dietary doses up to 3730 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR based on comparison of the AUCs). The combination of terfenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in a ratio of 1:2 by weight was studied in rats and rabbits. In rats, an oral combination dose of 150/300 mg/kg produced reduced fetal weight and delayed ossification with a finding of wavy ribs. The dose of 150 mg/kg of terfenadine in rats produced an AUC value of fexofenadine that was approximately 3 times the AUC of the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR. The dose of 300 mg/kg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in rats was approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR on a mg/m2 basis. In rabbits, an oral combination dose of 100/200 mg/kg produced decreased fetal weight. By extrapolation, the AUC of fexofenadine for 100 mg/kg orally of terfenadine was approximately 8 times the human AUC of the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR. The dose of 200 mg/kg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR on a mg/m2 basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic EffectsDose-related decreases in pup weight gain and survival were observed in rats exposed to an oral dose of 150 mg/kg of terfenadine; this dose produced an AUC of fexofenadine that was approximately 3 times the human AUC of the maximum recommended human daily oral dose of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR. Nursing Mothers It is not known if fexofenadine is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be used when fexofenadine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride administered alone distributes into breast milk of lactating human females. Pseudoephedrine concentrations in milk are consistently higher than those in plasma. The total amount of drug in milk as judged by AUC is 2 to 3 times greater than the plasma AUC. The fraction of a pseudoephedrine dose excreted in milk is estimated to be 0.4% to 0.7%. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Caution should be exercised when ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is administered to nursing women. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR in children below the age of 12 years have not been established. In addition, the doses of the individual components in ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR exceed the recommended individual doses for pediatric patients under 12 years of age. ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is not recommended for pediatric patients under 12 years of age. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, although the elderly are more likely to have adverse reactions to sympathomimetic amines. The pseudoephedrine component of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co–administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table Table 5 Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours in healthy adult subjects (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that ALLEGRA tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2 )]. ALLEGRA ODT can be taken with or without water.(see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1 )]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1) Other adverse reactions have been reported. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, coadministration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in healthy volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) (Peak plasma concentration) Erythromycin +82% +109% (500 mg every 8 hrs) Ketoconazole +135% +164% (400 mg once daily) The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, fexofenadine HCl and pseudoephedrine HCl extended-release tablets (24 hour formulation) are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of fexofenadine HCl and pseudoephedrine HCl extended-release tablets (24 hour formulation) concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS ). Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. Fexofenadine HCl and pseudoephedrine HCl extended-release tablets (24 hour formulation) should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. Interactions with Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the bioequivalence study data, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine HCl and pseudoephedrine HCl extended-release tablets (24 hour formulation) should be taken with water (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported. Pseudoephedrine HydrochloridePseudoephedrine hydrochloride may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity, cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic colitis have been reported. Sympathomimetic drugs have also been associated with other untoward effects such as fear, anxiety, tenseness, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, and cardiovascular collapse."

Table 3 also lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and adolescent patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose (see Pediatric Use).

In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis AdultsIn placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, which included 2461 subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. All adverse events that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily), and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo, are listed in Table 1. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, which included 570 subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Table 1 also lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. The incidence of adverse events, including drowsiness, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. Table 1 Adverse experiences in subjects aged 12 years and older reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in the United States Twice- daily dosing with fexofenadine capsules at rates of greater than 1% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=679) Placebo Twice Daily (n=671) Viral Infection (cold, flu) 2.5% 1.5% Nausea 1.6% 1.5% Dysmenorrhea 1.5% 0.3% Drowsiness 1.3% 0.9% Dyspepsia 1.3% 0.6% Fatigue 1.3% 0.9% Once daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at rates of greater than 2% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=283) Placebo (n=293) Headache 10.6% 7.5% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3.2% 3.1% Back Pain 2.8% 1.4% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory abnormalities were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. PediatricsTable 2 lists adverse experiences in subjects aged 6 to 11 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in the United States and Canada that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. Table 2 Adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily (n=209) Placebo (n=229) Headache 7.2% 6.6% Accidental Injury 2.9% 1.3% Coughing 3.8% 1.3% Fever 2.4% 0.9% Pain 2.4% 0.4% Otitis Media 2.4% 0.0% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 4.3% 1.7% Three clinical safety studies in 845 children aged 6 months to 5 years comparing 15 mg twice daily (n=85) and 30 mg twice daily (n=330) of an experimental formulation of fexofenadine to placebo (n=430) have been conducted. In general, fexofenadine hydrochloride was well tolerated in these studies. No unexpected adverse events were seen given the known safety profile of fexofenadine and likely adverse reactions for this patient population. (See PRECAUTIONS Pediatric Use.) Chronic Idiopathic UrticariaAdverse events reported by subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies were similar to those reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. In placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria clinical trials, which included 726 subjects 12 years of age and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated patients. Table 3 lists adverse experiences in subjects aged 12 years and older which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg tablets twice daily in controlled clinical studies in the United States and Canada and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, which included 167 subjects aged 12 years and older receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg tablets, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Table 3 also lists adverse experiences that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily and that were more common with fexofenadine hydrochloride than placebo. The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and adolescent patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose (see Pediatric Use). Table 3 Adverse experiences reported in subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in studies in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=191) Placebo (n=183) Dyspepsia 4.7% 4.4% Myalgia 2.6% 2.2% Back Pain 2.1% 1.1% Dizziness 2.1% 1.1% Pain in extremity 2.1% 0.0% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in a study in the United States at rates of greater than 2% Adverse experience Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=167) Placebo (n=92) Headache 4.8% 3.3% Nasopharyngitis 2.4% 2.2% Upper respiratory tract infection 2.4% 2.2% Events that have been reported during controlled clinical trials involving seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria subjects with incidences less than 1% and similar to placebo and have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance include: insomnia, nervousness, and sleep disorders or paroniria.

A placebo group was not included in this study. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 3.7% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination group, 0.5% for the fexofenadine hydrochloride group, and 4.1% for the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride group. All adverse events that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of the fexofenadine hydrochloride/pseudoephedrine hydrochloride combination are listed in the following table.

Fexofenadine HydrochlorideIn placebo-controlled clinical trials, which included 2461 subjects receiving fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily, adverse events were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride and placebo-treated subjects. The incidence of adverse events, including drowsiness, was not dose related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. The percent of subjects who withdrew prematurely because of adverse events was 2.2% with fexofenadine hydrochloride vs 3.3% with placebo. Events that have been reported during controlled clinical trials involving subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria at incidences less than 1% and similar to placebo and have been rarely reported during postmarketing surveillance include: insomnia, nervousness, and sleep disorders or paroniria. In rare cases, rash, urticaria, pruritus and hypersensitivity reactions with manifestations such as angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported. Pseudoephedrine HydrochloridePseudoephedrine hydrochloride may cause mild CNS stimulation in hypersensitive patients. Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, or insomnia may occur. Headache, drowsiness, tachycardia, palpitation, pressor activity, and cardiac arrhythmias have been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co-administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose) was co-administered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table. Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Co-Administration with Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in Healthy Volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug Cmax SS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCSS(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, Fexofenadine Hydrochloride and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of Fexofenadine Hydrochloride and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS). Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. Fexofenadine Hydrochloride and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. Interactions with Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that Fexofenadine Hydrochloride and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets should be taken with water (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported (6.1). Other adverse reactions have been reported.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antacids: Do not take at the same time as aluminum and magnesium containing antacids (7.1) Fruit juice: Take with water; not fruit juice 7.1 Antacids Fexofenadine hydrochloride should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. In healthy adult subjects, administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox® ) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, coadministration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine in healthy adult subjects. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In two separate studies in healthy adult subjects, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily (240 mg total daily dose) was coadministered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy adult subjects (n = 24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Table 5 Effects on Steady-State Fexofenadine Pharmacokinetics After 7 Days of Coadministration with Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg Every 12 Hours in Healthy Adult Subjects (n = 24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0-12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole(400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin coadministration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. 7.3 Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from three clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the data from a bioequivalence study, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets should be taken with water [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in subjects age 12 years and older were headache, back pain, dizziness, stomach discomfort, and pain in extremity. In subjects aged 6 to 11 years, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia and otitis media were more frequently reported. In subjects aged 6 months to 5 years, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue and rhinorrhea were more frequently reported. (6.1) Other adverse reactions have been reported. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5,083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3,010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily or 120 mg to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 mg to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 mg to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from one day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2,439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 mg or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to fexofenadine hydrochloride in 5083 patients in trials for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. In these trials, 3010 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 120 to 180 mg once daily. A total of 646 patients 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 60 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 2 weeks. A total of 534 patients 6 months to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 15 to 30 mg twice daily. The duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks. There were 893 patients 12 years of age and older with chronic idiopathic urticaria exposed to fexofenadine hydrochloride at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. The duration of treatment in these trials was 4 weeks. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Adults and Adolescents: In placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in subjects 12 years of age and older, 2439 subjects received fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules at doses of 20 mg to 240 mg twice daily. All adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 1% of subjects who received the recommended daily dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg capsules twice daily) are listed in Table 1. In another placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 571 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 120 or 180 mg once daily. Table 1 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. The incidence of adverse reactions, including somnolence/fatigue, was not dose-related and was similar across subgroups defined by age, gender, and race. Table 1 Adverse reactions in subjects aged 12 years and older reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis clinical trials in the United States Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine capsules at rates of greater than 1% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=680) Placebo Twice Daily (n=674) Frequency Frequency Dysmenorrhea 1.5% 0.3% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=283) Placebo (n=293) Frequency Frequency Headache 10.3% 7.2% Back Pain 2.5% 1.4% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory abnormalities were similar in fexofenadine hydrochloride- and placebo-treated subjects. Pediatrics: Table 2 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 6 years to 11 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at a dose of 30 mg twice daily in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in the United States and Canada. Table 2 Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to 11 years in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily (n=209) Placebo (n=229) Frequency Frequency Cough 3.8% 1.3% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 2.9% 0.9% Pyrexia 2.4% 0.9% Otitis Media 2.4% 0.0% Table 3 lists adverse reactions in subjects 6 months to 5 years of age which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride in 3 open single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies and 3 placebo-controlled safety studies with fexofenadine hydrochloride capsule content (484 subjects) and suspension (50 subjects) at doses of 15 mg (108 subjects) and 30 mg (426 subjects) given twice a day. Table 3 Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled studies in pediatric subjects with allergic rhinitis aged 6 months to 5 years of age at rates greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 15 mg Twice Daily Fexofenadine 30 mg Twice Daily Fexofenadine Total Twice Daily Placebo (n=108) Frequency (n=426) Frequency (n=534) Frequency (n=430) Frequency Vomiting 12.0% 4.2% 5.8% 8.6% Diarrhea 3.7% 2.8% 3.0% 2.6% Somnolence/Fatigue 2.8% 0.9% 1.3% 0.2% Rhinorrhea 0.9% 2.1% 1.9% 0.9% Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Adverse reactions reported by subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies were similar to those reported in placebo-controlled seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. In placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria clinical trials, 726 subjects 12 years of age and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 20 to 240 mg twice daily. Table 4 lists adverse reactions in subjects aged 12 years and older which were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg tablets twice daily in controlled clinical studies in the United States and Canada. In a placebo-controlled clinical study in the United States, 167 subjects aged 12 years and older received fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg tablets. Table 4 also lists adverse reactions that were reported by greater than 2% of subjects treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets at doses of 180 mg once daily. Table 4 Adverse reactions reported in subjects 12 years of age and older in placebo-controlled chronic idiopathic urticaria studies Twice-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in studies in the United States and Canada at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 60 mg Twice Daily (n=191) Frequency Placebo (n=183) Frequency Dizziness 2.1% 1.1% Back Pain 2.1% 1.1% Stomach discomfort 2.1% 0.6% Pain in extremity 2.1% 0.0% Once-daily dosing with fexofenadine hydrochloride in a study in the United States at rates of greater than 2% Adverse reaction Fexofenadine 180 mg Once Daily (n=167) Frequency Placebo (n=92) Frequency Headache 4.8% 3.3% The safety of fexofenadine hydrochloride in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients 6 months to 11 years of age is based on the safety profile of fexofenadine hydrochloride in adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical studies and listed above, the following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of fexofenadine hydrochloride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Events that have been reported rarely during postmarketing experience include: insomnia, nervousness, sleep disorders or paroniria, and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing, pruritus, and rash)."

        "Drug Interactions Fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride do not influence the pharmacokinetics of each other when administered concomitantly. Fexofenadine has been shown to exhibit minimal (ca. 5%) metabolism. However, co-administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride with either ketoconazole or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine. Fexofenadine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either erythromycin or ketoconazole. In 2 separate studies, fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg twice daily was co-administered with either erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 400 mg once daily under steady-state conditions to healthy volunteers (n=24, each study). No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole. The findings of these studies are summarized in the following table: Effects on steady-state fexofenadine pharmacokinetics after 7 days of co-administration with fexofenadine hydrochloride 120 mg every 12 hours (two times the recommended twice daily dose) in healthy volunteers (n=24) Concomitant Drug CmaxSS (Peak plasma concentration) AUCss(0–12h) (Extent of systemic exposure) Erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hrs) +82% +109% Ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) +135% +164% The changes in plasma levels were within the range of plasma levels achieved in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. The mechanism of these interactions has been evaluated in in vitro, in situ, and in vivo animal models. These studies indicate that ketoconazole or erythromycin co-administration enhances fexofenadine gastrointestinal absorption. This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. In vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion. Due to the pseudoephedrine component, ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and for 14 days after stopping use of an MAO inhibitor. Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs which interfere with sympathetic activity (e.g., methyldopa, mecamylamine, and reserpine) may reduce their antihypertensive effects. Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. Care should be taken in the administration of ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines because combined effects on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient (see WARNINGS). Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 × 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox®) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and Cmax by 43%. ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and magnesium containing antacids. Interactions with Fruit Juices Fruit juices such as grapefruit, orange and apple may reduce the bioavailability and exposure of fexofenadine. This is based on the results from 3 clinical studies using histamine induced skin wheals and flares coupled with population pharmacokinetic analysis. The size of wheal and flare were significantly larger when fexofenadine hydrochloride was administered with either grapefruit or orange juices compared to water. Based on the literature reports, the same effects may be extrapolated to other fruit juices such as apple juice. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. In addition, based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of the combined data from grapefruit and orange juices studies with the bioequivalence study data, the bioavailability of fexofenadine was reduced by 36%. Therefore, to maximize the effects of fexofenadine, it is recommended that ALLEGRA-D 24 HOUR should be taken with water (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."
