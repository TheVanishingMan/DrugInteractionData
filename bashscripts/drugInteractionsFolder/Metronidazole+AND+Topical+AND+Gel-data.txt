        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug interaction should be considered when metronidazole vaginal gel is prescribed for patients on this type of anticoagulant therapy. In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term oral metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium levels and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Use of cimetidine with oral metronidazole may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials There were no deaths or serious adverse events related to drug therapy in clinical trials involving 800 non-pregnant women who received metronidazole vaginal gel USP, 0.75%. In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of 505 non-pregnant women who received metronidazole vaginal gel USP, 0.75% once or twice a day, 2 patients (one from each regimen) discontinued therapy early due to drug-related adverse events. One patient discontinued drug because of moderate abdominal cramping and loose stools, while the other patient discontinued drug because of mild vaginal burning. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of drug. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, or possibly related to administration of metronidazole vaginal gel USP, 0.75% once or twice a day were reported for 195/505 (39%) patients. The incidence of individual adverse reactions were not significantly different between the two regimens. Unless percentages are otherwise stipulated, the incidence of individual adverse reactions listed below was less than 1%: Reproductive: Vaginal discharge (12%), Symptomatic Candida cervicitis/vaginitis (10%), Vulva/vaginal irritative symptoms (9%), Pelvic discomfort (3%). Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal discomfort (7%), Nausea and/or vomiting (4%), Unusual taste (2%), Diarrhea/loose stools (1%), Decreased appetite (1%), Abdominal bloating/gas; thirsty, dry mouth. Neurologic: Headache (5%), Dizziness (2%), Depression. Dermatologic: Generalized itching or rash. Other: Unspecified cramping (1%), Fatigue, Darkened urine. In previous clinical trials submitted for approved labeling of metronidazole vaginal gel USP, 0.75% the following was also reported: Laboratory: Increased/decreased white blood cell counts (1.7%). Other Metronidazole Formulations: Other effects that have been reported in association with the use of topical (dermal) formulations of metronidazole include skin irritation, transient skin erythema, and mild skin dryness and burning. None of these adverse events exceeded an incidence of 2% of patients. Metronidazole vaginal gel USP, 0.75% affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUC) of metronidazole compared to 500 mg oral metronidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of metronidazole: Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Central Nervous System: (See WARNINGS.) Headache, dizziness, syncope, ataxia, confusion, convulsive seizures, peripheral neuropathy, vertigo, incoordination, irritability, depression, weakness, insomnia. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an unpleasant metallic taste, anorexia, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, “furry” tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitis, and modification of taste of alcoholic beverages. Genitourinary: Overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decreased libido, proctitis. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, reversible thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Urticaria; erythematous rash; flushing; nasal congestion; dryness of the mouth, vagina, or vulva; fever; pruritus; fleeting joint pains. Renal: Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, a sense of pelvic pressure, darkened urine."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The intravaginal administration of a single 5 gram dose of VANDAZOLE results in relatively lower mean systemic exposure to metronidazole that is approximately 2% to 5% of that achieved following a 500 mg oral dose of metronidazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The following drug interactions were reported for oral metronidazole. Warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants: Prolonged anticoagulant effects reported with oral metronidazole; monitor INR and prothrombin time. (7.3) Lithium: Elevated lithium concentrations reported with oral metronidazole; monitor serum concentrations of lithium. (7.4) 7.1 Disulfiram Use of oral metronidazole has been associated with psychotic reactions in alcoholic patients who are using disulfiram concurrently. VANDAZOLE should not be used by patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 7.2 Alcoholic Beverages Use of oral metronidazole has been associated with a disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) to alcohol. Alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least three days after VANDAZOLE therapy [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 7.3 Coumarin and Other Oral Anticoagulants Use of oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug interaction should be considered when VANDAZOLE is prescribed for patients on this type of anticoagulant therapy. In patients on oral anticoagulants, consider monitoring prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), and other coagulation parameters while on VANDAZOLE. 7.4 Lithium Short-term use of oral metronidazole has been associated with elevation of serum lithium concentrations and, in a few cases signs of lithium toxicity, in patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium. Use VANDAZOLE with caution in patients treated with lithium and consider monitoring lithium serum concentrations while on VANDAZOLE. 7.5 Cimetidine Use of oral metronidazole with cimetidine may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole. No dose adjustment of VANDAZOLE is necessary."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients are: fungal infection, headache, pruritus, abdominal pain, nausea, dysmenorrhea, pharyngitis, rash, infection, diarrhea, breast pain, and metrorrhagia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevausa.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to VANDAZOLE compared to another formulation of vaginal metronidazole in 220 women in a single trial. The population was non-pregnant females (age range 18 to 72 years, the mean was 33 years +/- 11 years) with bacterial vaginosis. The racial demographic of those enrolled was 71 (32%) of White, 143 (65%) of Black, 3 (1%) of Hispanic, 2 (1%) of Asian, and 1 (0%) of other. Patients administered an applicator full of VANDAZOLE intravaginally once daily at bedtime for 5 days. There were no deaths or serious adverse reactions related to drug therapy in the clinical trial. VANDAZOLE was discontinued in 5 patients (2.3%) due to adverse reactions. The incidence of all adverse reactions in VANDAZOLE-treated patients was 42% (92/220). Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients were: fungal infection* (12%), headache (7%), pruritus (6%), abdominal pain (5%), nausea (3%), dysmenorrhea (3%), pharyngitis (2%), rash (1%), infection (1%), diarrhea (1%), breast pain (1%), and metrorrhagia (1%). * Known or previously unrecognized vaginal candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with VANDAZOLE. Approximately 10% of patients treated with VANDAZOLE developed Candida vaginitis during or immediately after therapy. Additional uncommon events, reported by < 1% of those women treated with VANDAZOLE included: General: allergic reaction, back pain, flu syndrome, mucous membrane disorder, pain Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, gingivitis, vomiting Nervous System: depression, dizziness, insomnia Respiratory System: asthma, rhinitis Skin and Appendages: acne, sweating, urticaria Urogenital System: breast enlargement, dysuria, female lactation, labial edema, leucorrhea, menorrhagia, pyleonephritis, salpingitis, urinary frequency, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, vulvovaginal disorder 6.2 Other Metronidazole Formulations Other Vaginal Formulations Other reactions that have been reported in association with the use of other formulations of metronidazole vaginal gel include: unusual taste and decreased appetite. Topical (Dermal) Formulations Other reactions that have been reported in association with the use of topical (dermal) formulations of metronidazole include skin irritation, transient skin erythema, and mild skin dryness and burning. None of these adverse reactions exceeded an incidence of 2% of patients. Oral and Parenteral Formulations The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of metronidazole: Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. In addition, patients have reported syncope, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, irritability, depression, weakness, and insomnia. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an unpleasant metallic taste, anorexia, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, “furry” tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitis, and modification of taste of alcoholic beverages. Genitourinary: Overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decreased libido, proctitis. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, reversible thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Urticaria; erythematous rash; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, flushing; nasal congestion; dryness of the mouth, vagina, or vulva; fever; pruritus; fleeting joint pains [see Contraindications (4.1)].

(5.1) Carcinogenicity in Animals: Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats; unnecessary use should be avoided (5.2, 13.1) Interference with laboratory tests: Metronidazole may interfere with certain serum chemistry laboratory values (5.3) 5.1 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects Use of oral or intravenous metronidazole is associated with convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or parethesia of an extremity [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. VANDAZOLE should be administered with caution to patients with central nervous system diseases. Discontinue VANDAZOLE promptly if a patient develops abnormal neurologic signs. 5.2 Carcinogenicity in Animals Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats [see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility (13.1)]. Unnecessary use of metronidazole should be avoided. Use of VANDAZOLE should be reserved for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [see Indications and Usage (1)] 5.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminostransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and glucose hexokinase. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides (NAD + NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7. Consider postponing chemistry laboratory tests to after treatment with VANDAZOLE."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The intravaginal administration of a single dose of NUVESSA results in lower systemic exposure to metronidazole that is approximately 2% to 4% of that achieved following oral administration of 500 mg metronidazole tablets [see Clinical​​​​ Pharmacology (12.3)​]. The following drug interactions were reported for oral metronidazole. Warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants: Prolonged anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants have been reported with co-administration of oral metronidazole. (7.3) Lithium: Elevated plasma lithium concentrations have been reported with oral metronidazole. (7.4) 7.1 Disulfiram Use of oral metronidazole has been associated with psychotic reactions in alcoholic patients who are using disulfiram concurrently. NUVESSA should not be used by patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks [see​​​​​ Contraindications (4.2)​]. 7.2 Alcoholic Beverages Use of oral metronidazole has been associated with a disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) to alcohol. Alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least 24 hours after NUVESSA therapy [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 7.3 Coumarin and Other Oral Anticoagulants Use of oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug interaction should be considered when NUVESSA is prescribed for patients on this type of anticoagulant therapy. 7.4 Lithium Short-term use of oral metronidazole has been associated with elevation of plasma lithium concentrations and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity in patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium. 7.5 Cimetidine Use of oral metronidazole with cimetidine may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole. No dose adjustment of NUVESSA is necessary."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical studies (incidence ≥1%) were vulvovaginal candidiasis, headache, vulvovaginal pruritus, nausea, diarrhea, and dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety of NUVESSA was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in subjects with bacterial vaginosis. A total of 321 non-pregnant females with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 18 to 67 years) received NUVESSA. Subjects were primarily Black/African American (58.3%) or White (39.3%). Subjects administered a single dose of NUVESSA at bedtime on the first day of the study. There were no deaths or serious adverse events in this trial. Adverse events were reported by 19.0% of subjects treated with NUVESSA versus 16.1% of subjects treated with Vehicle Gel. Adverse events occurring in ≥1% of subjects receiving NUVESSA were: vulvovaginal candidiasis (5.6%), headache (2.2%), vulvovaginal pruritus (1.6%), nausea (1.6%), diarrhea (1.2%), and dysmenorrhea (1.2%). No subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events. ​​​​6.2 Other Metronidazole Formulations Other Vaginal Formulations Other reactions that have been reported in association with the use of other formulations of metronidazole vaginal gel include: unusual taste and decreased appetite. Topical (Dermal) Formulations Other reactions that have been reported in association with the use of topical (dermal) formulations of metronidazole include skin irritation, transient skin erythema, and mild skin dryness and burning. None of these adverse reactions exceeded an incidence of 2% of patients. Oral and Parenteral Formulations The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of metronidazole: Cardiovascular:​​​ Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with oral metronidazole have been convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. In addition, patients have reported syncope, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, irritability, depression, weakness, and insomnia. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an unpleasant metallic taste, anorexia, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, “furry” tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitis, and modification of taste of alcoholic beverages. Genitourinary: Overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decreased libido, proctitis. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, reversible thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Urticaria; erythematous rash; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, flushing; nasal congestion; dryness of the mouth, vagina, or vulva; fever; pruritus; fleeting joint pains [see​​​​​ Contraindications (4)​]. Renal:​ Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, a sense of pelvic pressure, darkened urine."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Central and peripheral nervous system effects: Convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with oral or intravenous metronidazole. Discontinue promptly if abnormal neurologic signs develop (5.1) Interference with laboratory tests: Metronidazole may interfere with certain serum chemistry laboratory values. (5.3) 5.1 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects Convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity, have been reported in patients treated with oral or intravenous metronidazole. NUVESSA should be administered with caution to patients with central nervous system diseases. 5.2 Carcinogenicity in Animals Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic at high doses administered orally in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology​​​ ​ (13.1)]. Unnecessary ​​​use of metronidazole should be avoided. Use of NUVESSA should be reserved for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [see Indications and Usage (1)]. 5.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and glucose hexokinase. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation reduction of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides (NAD + NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7."

        "ADVERSE EVENTS Clinical Trials: There were no deaths or serious adverse events related to drug therapy in clinical trials involving 800 non-pregnant women who received Metronidazole Vaginal Gel. In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of 505 non-pregnant women who received Metronidazole Vaginal Gel once or twice a day, 2 patients (one from each regimen) discontinued therapy early due to drug-related adverse events. One patient discontinued drug because of moderate abdominal cramping and loose stools, while the other patient discontinued drug because of mild vaginal burning. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of drug. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, or possibly related to administration of Metronidazole Vaginal Gel once or twice a day were reported for 195/505 (39%) patients. The incidence of individual adverse reactions were not significantly different between the two regimens. Unless percentages are otherwise stipulated, the incidence of individual adverse reactions listed below was less than 1%: Reproductive: Vaginal discharge (12%), Symptomatic Candida cervicitis/vaginitis (10%), Vulva/vaginal irritative symptoms (9%), Pelvic discomfort (3%). Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal discomfort (7%), Nausea and/or vomiting (4%), Unusual taste (2%), Diarrhea/loose stools (1%), Decreased appetite (1%), Abdominal bloating/gas; thirsty, dry mouth. Neurologic: Headache (5%), Dizziness (2%), Depression. Dermatologic: Generalized itching or rash. Other: Unspecified cramping (1%), Fatigue, Darkened urine. In previous clinical trials submitted for approved labeling of Metronidazole Vaginal Gel the following was also reported: Laboratory: Increased/decreased white blood cell counts (1.7%). Other Metronidazole Formulations: Other effects that have been reported in association with the use of topical (dermal) formulations of metronidazole include skin irritation, transient skin erythema, and mild skin dryness and burning. None of these adverse events exceeded an incidence of 2% of patients Metronidazole Vaginal Gel affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUC) of metronidazole compared to 500 mg oral metronidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of metronidazole: Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials:There were no deaths or serious adverse events related to drug therapy in clinical trials involving 800 non-pregnant women who received METROGEL-VAGINAL. In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of 505 non-pregnant women who received METROGEL-VAGINAL once or twice a day, 2 patients (one from each regimen) discontinued therapy early due to drug-related adverse events. One patient discontinued drug because of moderate abdominal cramping and loose stools, while the other patient discontinued drug because of mild vaginal burning. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of drug. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, or possibly related to administration of METROGEL-VAGINAL once or twice a day were reported for 195/505 (39%) patients. The incidence of individual adverse reactions were not significantly different between the two regimens. Unless percentages are otherwise stipulated, the incidence of individual adverse reactions listed below was less than 1%: Reproductive: Vaginal discharge (12%), Symptomatic Candida cervicitis/vaginitis (10%), Vulva/vaginal irritative symptoms (9%), Pelvic discomfort (3%). Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal discomfort (7%), Nausea and/or vomiting (4%), Unusual taste (2%), Diarrhea/loose stools (1%), Decreased appetite (1%), Abdominal bloating/gas; thirsty, dry mouth. Neurologic: Headache (5%), Dizziness (2%), Depression. Dermatologic: Generalized itching or rash. Other: Unspecified cramping (1%), Fatigue, Darkened urine. In previous clinical trials submitted for approved labeling of METROGEL-VAGINAL the following was also reported: Laboratory: Increased/decreased white blood cell counts (1.7%). Other Metronidazole Formulations:Other effects that have been reported in association with the use of topical (dermal) formulations of metronidazole include skin irritation, transient skin erythema, and mild skin dryness and burning. None of these adverse events exceeded an ­incidence of 2% of patients METROGEL-VAGINAL affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUC) of metronidazole compared to 500 mg oral metro­nidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common ­reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of metronidazole: Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Central Nervous System: (See WARNINGS .) Headache, dizziness, syncope, ataxia, confusion, convulsive seizures, peripheral neuropathy, vertigo, incoordination, irritability, depression, weakness, insomnia. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an unpleasant metallic taste, anorexia, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, “furry” tongue, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitis, and modification of taste of alcoholic beverages. Genitourinary: Overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decreased libido, proctitis. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, reversible thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Urticaria; erythematous rash; flushing; nasal congestion; dryness of the mouth, vagina, or vulva; fever; pruritus; fleeting joint pains. Renal: Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, a sense of pelvic pressure, darkened urine."
