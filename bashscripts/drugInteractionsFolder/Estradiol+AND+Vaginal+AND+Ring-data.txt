        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, such as CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs. (7) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on CHCs Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs and potentially diminishing the effectiveness of CHCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of CHCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between CHCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with NuvaRing, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. The serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol were not affected by concomitant administration of oral amoxicillin or doxycycline in standard dosages during 10 days of antibiotic treatment. The effects of other antibiotics on etonogestrel or ethinyl estradiol concentrations have not been evaluated. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Co-administration of vaginal miconazole nitrate and NuvaRing increases the serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol by up to 40% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and /or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of CHCs on Other Drugs CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control, therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of CHCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling. Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by CHC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥2%) in clinical trials were: vaginitis, headache (including migraine), mood changes (e.g., depression, mood swings, mood altered, depressed mood, affect lability), device-related events (e.g., expulsion/discomfort/foreign body sensation), nausea/vomiting, vaginal discharge, increased weight, vaginal discomfort, breast pain/discomfort/tenderness, dysmenorrhea, abdominal pain, acne, and decreased libido. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck, Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Trials with a duration of 6 to 13 28-day cycles provided safety data. In total, 2,501 women, aged 18 to 41 contributed 24,520 cycles of exposure. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2%): vaginitis (13.8%), headache (including migraine) (11.2%), mood changes (e.g., depression, mood swings, mood altered, depressed mood, affect lability) (6.4%), device-related events (e.g., expulsion/discomfort/foreign body sensation) (6.3%), nausea/vomiting (5.9%), vaginal discharge (5.7%), increased weight (4.9%), vaginal discomfort (4.0%), breast pain/discomfort/tenderness (3.8%), dysmenorrhea (3.5%), abdominal pain (3.2%), acne (2.4%), and decreased libido (2.0%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: 13.0% of the women discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were device-related events (2.7%), mood changes (1.7%), headache (including migraine) (1.5%) and vaginal symptoms (1.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions: deep vein thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], anxiety, cholelithiasis, and vomiting. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NuvaRing. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity Nervous system disorders: stroke/cerebrovascular accident Vascular disorders: arterial events (including arterial thromboembolism and myocardial infarction), aggravation of varicose veins Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria, chloasma Reproductive system and breast disorders: penile disorders, including local reactions on penis (in male partners of women using NuvaRing), galactorrhea"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop NuvaRing use if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop NuvaRing use at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS): If patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment. (5.2) Liver disease: Discontinue NuvaRing use if jaundice develops. (5.3) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop NuvaRing use if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue NuvaRing use if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop NuvaRing use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop NuvaRing use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] If feasible, stop NuvaRing at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization. Start NuvaRing no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)]. Two epidemiologic studies1, 2, 3 that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of NuvaRing are described below. In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, NuvaRing users had a risk of VTE similar to COC users (see Table 1 for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of NuvaRing (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting NuvaRing or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among NuvaRing users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY. A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of NuvaRing to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel. 8.2 events per 10,000 WY. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Users of NuvaRing Compared to Users of Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product(s) Hazard Ratios (HR) (95% CI) TASC (Dinger, 2012) Initiators, including new users, switchers and restarters All COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, ethynodiol diacetate, gestodene, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, norgestimate, or norgestrel COCs available excluding DSG- or GSD -containing OCs HRAdjusted for age, BMI, duration of use, VTE history: 0.8 (0.5-1.5) HR: 0.8 (0.4-1.7) FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases (Sidney, 2011) First use of a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) during the study period COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HRAdjusted for age, site, year of entry into study: 1.1 (0.6-2.2) LNG/0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol HR: 1.0 (0.5-2.0) An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of CHCs is well-established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1). The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE *CHC=combination hormonal contraception **Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY. Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in NuvaRing, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk. Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. Use NuvaRing with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Figure 1 5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) Cases of TSS have been reported by NuvaRing users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the NuvaRing users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of NuvaRing and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment. 5.3 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use NuvaRing in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Discontinue NuvaRing use if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors NuvaRing is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (>8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users. 5.4 High Blood Pressure NuvaRing is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop NuvaRing use if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Vaginal Use NuvaRing may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration. Vaginal/cervical erosion or ulceration in women using NuvaRing has been reported. In some cases, the ring adhered to vaginal tissue, necessitating removal by a healthcare provider. Some women are aware of the ring on occasion during the 21 days of use or during intercourse, and sexual partners may feel NuvaRing in the vagina. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using NuvaRing. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Some women will have adverse lipid changes while on CHCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using CHCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman using NuvaRing develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue NuvaRing if indicated. Consider discontinuation of NuvaRing in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC. Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512). Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of NuvaRing. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.10 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of NuvaRing into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in NuvaRing users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring. 5.11 CHC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue NuvaRing if pregnancy is confirmed. 5.12 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue NuvaRing use if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.13 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Cervix NuvaRing is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that CHCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.14 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.15 Monitoring A woman who is using NuvaRing should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.16 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.17 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using NuvaRing."

        "Drug Interactions Effects of Drospirenone on Other Drugs Metabolic Interactions Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies (see Metabolism). In in vitro studies, DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the systemic clearance of the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole (40 mg) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy-omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrated that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two further clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4, were each performed in 24 healthy, postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady-state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Based on the available results of in vivo and in vitro studies, it can be concluded that, at clinical dose level, DRSP is unlikely to interact significantly with cytochrome P450 enzymes. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John's Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects. Co-Administration with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking drospirenone with other drugs that may affect electrolytes, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Electrolytes were studied in 230 postmenopausal women with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus requiring an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Of these, 26 patients had a creatinine clearance >50 mL/min to <80 mL/min. Patients were given 1 mg estradiol (E2) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) (n=112) or placebo (n=118) over 28 days. Non-diabetic patients also received ibuprofen 1200 mg/day for 5 days during the study. There was a single case of serum potassium >6.0 mEq/L and a single case of serum sodium <130 mEq/L on treatment, both occurring following five days of ibuprofen therapy in two women taking E2/DRSP. Serum potassium levels ≥5.5 mEq/L were observed in 8 (7.3%) E2/DRSP-treated subjects (3 diabetic and 5 non-diabetic) and in 3 (2.6%) placebo-treated subjects (2 diabetic and 1 non-diabetic). After 28 days of exposure, the mean change from baseline in serum potassium was 0.11 mEq/L for the E2/DRSP group and 0.08 mEq/L for the placebo group. None of the subjects with serum potassium levels ≥5.5 mEq/L had cardiovascular adverse events. A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium levels were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium levels in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple timepoints over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.080), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations >5.5 mEq/L). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the ANGELIQ clinical trials."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Dienogest is a substrate of CYP3A4. Women who take medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of increased breakthrough bleeding and/or decreased contraceptive efficacy. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Multiple dose co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin with estradiol valerate/dienogest tablets in healthy postmenopausal women led to a decrease in dienogest and estradiol systemic exposure at steady state. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] Substances Increasing the Systemic Exposure of COCs (enzyme inhibitors): Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like azole antifungals (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (for example, clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit increase the serum concentrations of both estradiol and dienogest. In a multiple dose study investigating the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole and erythromycin) on Natazia, steady state estradiol and dienogest exposures were increased when co-administered with ketoconazole or erythromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors : Significant changes (increase and decrease) in plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] In vitro studies with human CYP enzymes did not indicate an inhibitory potential of dienogest at clinically relevant concentrations. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

Contraception and Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Studies A total of 2,131 women, 18 to 54 years of age, who took at least one dose of Natazia were enrolled in four clinical phase 3 trials. A total of 1,867 subjects were included in two clinical phase 3 studies with a treatment duration up to 28 cycles with Natazia as an oral contraceptive and 264 subjects in the two phase 3 clinical trials with a treatment duration of 7 cycles evaluating Natazia in the treatment of heavy, prolonged, and/or frequent menstrual bleeding in women without organic pathology. [See Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2.)] Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 11.4% of the women discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were menstrual disorder (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, genital hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding) (2.3%); mood changes (depression, mood swings, mood altered, depressed mood, dysthymic disorder, crying) (1.2%); acne (1.1%), headache (including migraines) (1.1%), and weight increased (0.7 %). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2%): headache (including migraines) (12.7%), breast pain, discomfort or tenderness (7.0%), menstrual disorders (metrorrhagia, menstruation irregular, menorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, genital hemorrhage, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, uterine hemorrhage) (6.9%), nausea or vomiting (6.0%), acne (3.9%), mood changes (depression, mood swings, depressed mood, mood altered, affect lability, dysthymic disorder, crying) (3.0%) and increased weight (2.9%). Serious Adverse Reactions: myocardial infarction (2 cases), ruptured ovarian cyst (2 cases), deep vein thrombosis, focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, uterine leiomyoma, acute cholecystitis, and chronic acalculous cholecystitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Natazia. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Fluid retention, hypertriglyceridemia Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal symptoms (for example, abdominal pain) Infections and infestations: Vulvovaginal candidiasis"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Natazia if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Natazia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Natazia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue Natazia if jaundice occurs. (5.3) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Natazia for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Natazia. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Natazia if indicated. (5.7) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) • CYP3A4 induction: Women taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. (5.13, 7.1) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Natazia if an arterial or venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. The use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Natazia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Natazia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Natazia if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Natazia because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. Endometrial biopsies performed in a subset of subjects in a Phase 3 Natazia clinical trial did not reveal any unexpected or concerning findings for subjects taking COCs. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Natazia if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Natazia if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Natazia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Natazia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Natazia if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Women who are not pregnant and use Natazia, may experience amenorrhea. Based on patient diaries, amenorrhea occurs in approximately 16% of cycles in women using Natazia. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea occurring in two or more consecutive cycles. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Based on patient diaries from three clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Natazia for contraception, 10-23% of women experienced intracyclic bleeding per cycle. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Natazia discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Drug Interactions Women who take medications that are strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Yaz with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]",

Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yaz in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 – 36 who took at least one dose of Yaz. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of Yaz on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18–35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14–45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of Yaz, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the Contraception and Acne studies as compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated safety and efficacy of Yaz during up to 3 cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD and who took at least one dose of Yaz. Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Of 285 women, 11.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: nausea/vomiting (4.6%), menstrual irregularity (including vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, menstruation irregular and metrorrhagia) (4.2%), fatigue (1.8%), breast tenderness (1.4%), depression (1.4%), headache (1.1%), and irritability (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials PMDD Clinical Trials: cervical dysplasia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Yaz. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Yaz if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Yaz in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Yaz if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Yaz for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Yaz. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Yaz if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Yaz if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Yaz in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Yaz at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Yaz no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Yaz if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] fig 1 Figure 2 Likelihood of Developing a VTE 5.2 Hyperkalemia Yaz contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Yaz is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Yaz because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Yaz if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra‑abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long‑term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Yaz if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Yaz. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Yaz develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Yaz if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of Yaz, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Yaz may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb‑reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yaz discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma levels of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes (increase and decrease) in plasma levels of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DRSP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro and clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interactions that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking Yaz with other drugs that may increase serum potassium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4.0%) and mood changes (2.2%). The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions in PMDD clinical trials were: menstrual irregularities (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yaz in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 – 36 who took at least one dose of Yaz. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of Yaz on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18–35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14–45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of Yaz, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the Contraception and Acne studies as compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated safety and efficacy of Yaz during up to 3 cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD and who took at least one dose of Yaz. Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%) . PMDD Clinical Trials Of 285 women, 11.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: nausea/vomiting (4.6%), menstrual irregularity (including vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, menstruation irregular and metrorrhagia) (4.2%), fatigue (1.8%), breast tenderness (1.4%), depression (1.4%), headache (1.1%), and irritability (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials PMDD Clinical Trials: cervical dysplasia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Yaz. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Yaz if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Hyperkalemia: DRSP has antimineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium level during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium. (5.2, 7.3) Liver disease: Discontinue Yaz if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Yaz for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Yaz. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Yaz if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Yaz if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. The use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Interim data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Interim data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Yaz at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Yaz no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Yaz if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Epidemiologic studies including a DRSP-containing COC Several studies have investigated the relative risks of thromboembolism in women using a different DRSP-containing COC (Yasmin, which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) compared to those in women using COCs containing other progestins. Two prospective cohort studies, both evaluating the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism and death, were initiated at the time of Yasmin approval.1,2 The first (EURAS) showed the risk of thromboembolism (particularly venous thromboembolism) and death in Yasmin users to be comparable to that of other oral contraceptive preparations, including those containing levonorgestrel (a so-called second generation COC). The second prospective cohort study (Ingenix) also showed a comparable risk of thromboembolism in Yasmin users compared to users of other COCs, including those containing levonorgestrel. In the second study, COC comparator groups were selected based on their having similar characteristics to those being prescribed Yasmin. Two additional epidemiological studies, one case-control study (van Hylckama Vlieg et al.3) and one retrospective cohort study (Lidegaard et al.4) suggested that the risk of venous thromboembolism occurring in Yasmin users was higher than that for users of levonorgestrel-containing COCs and lower than that for users of desogestrel/gestodene-containing COCs (so-called third generation COCs). In the case-control study, however, the number of Yasmin cases was very small (1.2% of all cases) making the risk estimates unreliable. The relative risk for Yasmin users in the retrospective cohort study was greater than that for users of other COC products when considering women who used the products for less than one year. However, these one-year estimates may not be reliable because the analysis may include women of varying risk levels. Among women who used the product for 1 to 4 years, the relative risk was similar for users of Yasmin to that for users of other COC products. 5.2 Hyperkalemia Yaz contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Yaz should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium should have their serum potassium level checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Yaz because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Yaz if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Yaz if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Yaz. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Yaz develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Yaz if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of Yaz, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Yaz may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yaz discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. The following interactions have been reported in the literature for COCs in general or were studied in clinical trials with Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest. CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include barbiturates, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when moderate or weak enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Dienogest is a substrate of CYP3A4. Women who take medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. The effect of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin was studied in healthy postmenopausal women. Co-administration of rifampicin with estradiol valerate/dienogest tablets led to a 52 % and 83% decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC (0–24hr), respectively, for dienogest and a 25% and 44% decrease in Cmax and AUC (0–24hr), respectively, for estradiol at steady state. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole increased hormone serum concentrations. In a study investigating the effect of ketoconazole on dienogest and estradiol pharmacokinetics, co-administration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 186% increase of AUC (0–24hr) at steady state for dienogest and a 57% increase for estradiol. There was also a 94% and 65% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol when co-administered with ketoconazole. Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors : The AUC (0–24hr) of dienogest and estradiol at steady state were increased by 62% and 33%, respectively, when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin. There was also a 33% and 51% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol, respectively, when co-administered with erythromycin. Other known CYP3A4 inhibitors like azole antifungals, cimetidine, verapamil, macrolides, diltiazem, antidepressants, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of dienogest. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors : Significant changes (increase and decrease) in plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro studies with human CYP enzymes did not indicate an inhibitory potential of dienogest at clinically relevant concentrations. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

Contraception and Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Studies A total of 2,131 women, 18 to 54 years of age, who took at least one dose of Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest were enrolled in four clinical phase 3 trials. A total of 1,867 subjects were included in two clinical phase 3 studies with a treatment duration up to 28 cycles with Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest as an oral contraceptive and 264 subjects in the two phase 3 clinical trials with a treatment duration of 7 cycles evaluating Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest in the treatment of heavy, prolonged, and/or frequent menstrual bleeding in women without organic pathology. [See Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2.)] Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 11.4% of the women discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were menstrual disorder (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, genital hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding) (2.3%); mood changes (depression, mood swings, mood altered, depressed mood, dysthymic disorder, crying) (1.2%); acne (1.1%), headache (including migraines) (1.1%), and weight increased (0.7 %). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2%): headache (including migraines) (12.7%), breast pain, discomfort or tenderness (7.0%), menstrual disorders (metrorrhagia, menstruation irregular, menorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, genital hemorrhage, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, uterine hemorrhage) (6.9%), nausea or vomiting (6.0%), acne (3.9%), mood changes (depression, mood swings, depressed mood, mood altered, affect lability, dysthymic disorder, crying) (3.0%) and increased weight (2.9%). Serious Adverse Reactions: myocardial infarction (2 cases), ruptured ovarian cyst (2 cases), deep vein thrombosis, focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, uterine leiomyoma, acute cholecystitis, and chronic acalculous cholecystitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Fluid retention, hypertriglyceridemia Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Gastrointestinal symptoms (for example, abdominal pain) Infections and infestations: Vulvovaginal candidiasis"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if jaundice occurs. (5.3) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if indicated. (5.7) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) • CYP3A4 induction: Women taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest as their oral contraceptive due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. (5.13, 7.1) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if an arterial or venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. The use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. Endometrial biopsies performed in a subset of subjects in a Phase 3 Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest clinical trial did not reveal any unexpected or concerning findings for subjects taking COCs. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Women who are not pregnant and use Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest, may experience amenorrhea. Based on patient diaries, amenorrhea occurs in approximately 16% of cycles in women using Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea occurring in two or more consecutive cycles. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Based on patient diaries from three clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest for contraception, 10-23% of women experienced intracyclic bleeding per cycle. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Drug Interactions Women who take medications that are strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with GENERESS Fe. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Ethinyl Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

A phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of GENERESS Fe for pregnancy prevention. The study was a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study with a treatment duration of 12 months (thirteen 28-day cycles). A total of 1,677 women aged 18-46 were enrolled and took at least one dose of GENERESS Fe. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 8.5% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.0%), weight increase (0.8%), acne (0.8%), metrorrhagia (0.7%), altered mood (0.4%), hypertension (0.4%), irritability (0.3%), migraine (0.3%), decreased libido (0.3%) and mood swings (0.3%). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of all treated subjects): nausea/vomiting (8.8%), headaches/migraine (7.5%), depression/mood complaints (4.1%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), acne (3.2%), anxiety symptoms (2.4%), breast pain/tenderness (2.4%), and increased weight (2.3%).

Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.

If feasible, stop GENERESS Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start GENERESS Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Patient diaries from the clinical trial of GENERESS Fe showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking GENERESS Fe had unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. From Cycle 2-13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21-31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6 – 4.2 in cycles 2-13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation. Women who are not pregnant and use GENERESS Fe may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2-13 was 3.7 days. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other drugs a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include barbiturates, rifampin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. Since desogestrel is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP 2C9) to form etonogestrel, the active progestin, there is a possibility of interaction with CYP 2C9 substrates or inhibitors (such as: ibuprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, phenytoin, fluconazole, diclofenac, tolbutamide, glipizide, celecoxib, sulfamethoxazole, isoniazid, torsemide, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan). The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The efficacy and safety of these oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma hormone levels associated with co-administered drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain ethinyl estradiol containing oral contraceptives increased AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with CYCLESSA®."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking OCELLA with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA at 1-888-838-2872 (x6351) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of OCELLA (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 -35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of OCELLA vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17-40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OCELLA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop OCELLA if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating OCELLA in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue OCELLA if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe OCELLA for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking OCELLA. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue OCELLA if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop OCELLA if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on OCELLA, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of OCELLA in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 3 mg of DRSP and 0.03 mg of EE) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users\"New users\" - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van HylckamaVlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van HylckamaVlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2 Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop OCELLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start OCELLA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop OCELLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] fig 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use OCELLA because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue OCELLA if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop OCELLA if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking OCELLA. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking OCELLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue OCELLA if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took OCELLA and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the OCELLA trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use OCELLA may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and OCELLA discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Camrese. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Camrese if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Camrese at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Camrese no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Camrese if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Camrese for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Camrese. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Camrese if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Camrese if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Camrese provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop Camrese at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Camrese no earlier than 4-6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Camrese if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Camrese because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Camrese if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Camrese if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Camrese. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Camrese develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Camrese if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing Camrese, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Camrese also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Camrese, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28-Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 10 6.9 1.7 4th 0 1 4 3.2 0.8 Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting. 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28-Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 11 7.4 1.9 4th 0 2 7 4.4 1.1 Figure 1 shows the percentage of Camrese subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Camrese who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Camrese discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid andacetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DRSP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the CYP system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache •The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4.0%) and mood changes (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problem Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospierenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol 3 mg/0.03 mg Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the study HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van HylckamaVlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets 3 mg/0.03 mg Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish reanalysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] fig 1 fig 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra‑abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long‑term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb‑reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin and bosentan. Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interaction between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results. Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combined hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Concurrent use of bosentan and norethisterone/ethinyl estradiol may result in decreased concentrations of these contraceptive hormones, thereby increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy and unscheduled bleeding. Increase in plasma levels associated with co-administered drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs Combined hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. Combined hormonal contraceptives have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine when co-administered due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.95 Healthcare professionals are advised to also refer to prescribing information of co-administered drugs for recommendations regarding management of concomitant therapy."

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other drugs a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include barbiturates, rifampin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and griseofulvin. Since desogestrel is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP 2C9) to form etonogestrel, the active progestin, there is a possibility of interaction with CYP 2C9 substrates or inhibitors (such as: ibuprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, phenytoin, fluconazole, diclofenac, tolbutamide, glipizide, celecoxib, sulfamethoxazole, isoniazid, torsemide, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan). The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The efficacy and safety of these oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: Previfem®: headache/migraine, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, vaginal infection, genital discharge, breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered), flatulence, nervousness, rash. (6.1) Tri-Previfem®: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Qualitest Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-444-4011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg: The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5.0%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5.0%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg: The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adver se Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if jaundice occurs. (5.2) • High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension monitor blood pressure and stop Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Previfem® or Tri-Previfem®. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if indicated. (5.6) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. Stop Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If feasible, stop Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4) ]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Previfem® and Tri-Previfem® are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Previfem® and Tri-Previfem® are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Previfem® and Tri-Previfem® if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Previfem® or Tri-Previfem®. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg and norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg and 231 (4.8%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14-34% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.25 mg/0.035 mg experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year; for norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, the respective numbers were 13-38%. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Previfem® or Tri-Previfem® if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix Previfem® and Tri-Previfem® are contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Previfem® or Previfem®."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: Estarylla™: headache/migraine, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, vaginal infection, genital discharge, breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered), flatulence, nervousness, rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz, Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Estarylla™ was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Estarylla™ for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Estarylla™ if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) •Liver disease: Discontinue Estarylla™ if jaundice occurs. (5.2) •High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Estarylla™ if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Estarylla™. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Estarylla™ if indicated. (5.6) •Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems •Stop Estarylla™ if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop Estarylla™ if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Estarylla™ at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Estarylla™ no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Estarylla™ in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Estarylla™ if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Estarylla™ is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Estarylla™ is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Estarylla™ if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Estarylla™. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Estarylla™ develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Estarylla™ if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Estarylla™ in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of Estarylla™, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued Estarylla™, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14 to 34% of women using Estarylla™ experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Estarylla™ may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Estarylla™ use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Estarylla™ if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix •Estarylla™ is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. •Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Estarylla™."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes : In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration : There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets vs. 0.15 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (greater than or equal to 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks : Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1). COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE (5.1). Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) Liver disease : Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure : Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study ( Author , Year of Publication ) Population Studied Comparator Product ( all are low - dose COCs ; with less than or equal to 0 . 04 mg of EE ) Hazard Ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % CI ) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users “New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5 to 1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) HR: 1 (0.6 to 1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE Other COCs available during the course of the study Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3 to 2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1 to 2.2) HR: 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2 to 1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio less than 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, greater than 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6).] 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2% to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets trials (less than 1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1% to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure Figure"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Minastrin 24 Fe. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (greater than or equal to 2%) were: headache, vaginal candidiasis, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, bacterial vaginitis, abnormal cervical smear, acne, mood swings, and weight gain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data presented in Section 6.1 are from a clinical trial conducted with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Minastrin 24 Fe is bioequivalent to these norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets. Common Adverse Reactions (Greater Than or Equal to 2% of all Treated Subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), abnormal cervical smear (3.1%), acne (2.7%), mood swings (2.2%), and weight gain (2.0%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal or irregular bleeding (1.3%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.5%), and increased blood pressure (0.4%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes. Vascular disorders: thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein). Hepatobiliary disorders: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma of liver. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction. Skin and subcutaneous disorders: alopecia, rash (generalized and allergic), pruritus, skin discoloration. GI disorders: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia. Eye disorders: blurred vision, visual impairment, corneal thinning, change in corneal curvature (steepening). Infections and infestations: fungal infection, vaginal infection. Investigations: change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease), fatigue, malaise, peripheral edema, blood pressure increased. Nervous system disorders: headache, dizziness, migraine, loss of consciousness. Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, depression, insomnia, anxiety, suicidal ideation, panic attack, changes in libido. Renal and urinary disorders: cystitis-like syndrome. Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast changes (tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion), premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea. Cardiovascular: chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, myocardial infarction."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs (5.2) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Minastrin 24 Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated (5.6) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop Minastrin 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Start Minastrin 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Minastrin 24 Fe in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Minastrin 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Minastrin 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Minastrin 24 Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Minastrin 24 Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24-35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally-sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Minastrin 24 Fe."

( 7 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop LoSeasonique if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop LoSeasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start LoSeasonique no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue LoSeasonique if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe LoSeasonique for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking LoSeasonique. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue LoSeasonique if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Vascular Events Stop COCs if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Use of LoSeasonique provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year.) If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing LoSeasonique, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of LoSeasonique also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued LoSeasonique, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2-3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking LoSeasonique who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting (Based on Daily Diaries) Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: ORTHO-CYCLEN: headache/migraine, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, vaginal infection, genital discharge, breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered), flatulence, nervousness, rash. (6.1) ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. ORTHO-CYCLEN The safety of ORTHO-CYCLEN was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of ORTHO-CYCLEN for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5.0%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5.0%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN The safety of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. Stop ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If feasible, stop ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if indicated. Consider discontinuation of ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued ORTHO-CYCLEN and 231 (4.8%) women discontinued ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14–34% of women using ORTHO-CYCLEN experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year; for ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN, the respective numbers were 13–38%. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue ORTHO-CYCLEN or ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix ORTHO-CYCLEN and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN are contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN or ORTHO-CYCLEN."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Enter section text here Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Women taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. The following interactions have been reported in the literature for COCs in general or were studied in clinical trials with Natazia. CYP3A4 Inducers: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include barbiturates, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when moderate or weak enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Dienogest is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Women who take medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. The effect of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin was studied in healthy postmenopausal women. Co-administration of rifampicin with estradiol valerate/dienogest tablets led to a 52 % and 83% decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC(0 –24hr), respectively, for dienogest and a 25% and 44% decrease in Cmax and AUC(0–24hr), respectively, for estradiol at steady state. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole increased hormone serum concentrations. In a study investigating the effect of ketoconazole on dienogest and estradiol pharmacokinetics, co-administration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in a 186% increase of AUC (0 –24hr) at steady state for dienogest and a 57% increase for estradiol. There was also a 94% and 65% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol when co-administered with ketoconazole. Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors : The AUC (0–24hr) of dienogest and estradiol at steady state were increased by 62% and 33%, respectively, when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, erythromycin. There was also a 33% and 51% increase of Cmax at steady state for dienogest and estradiol, respectively, when co-administered with erythromycin. Other known CYP.3A4 inhibitors like azole antifungals, cimetidine, verapamil, macrolides, diltiazem, antidepressants, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma levels of dienogest. HIV Protease Inhibitors : Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Antibiotics : There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (or mestranol), may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro studies with human CYP enzymes did not indicate an inhibitory potential of dienogest at clinically relevant concentrations."

Contraception StudiesTwo multicenter phase 3 clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of Natazia for pregnancy prevention. Both were non-comparative, open-labeled, single-arm studies with a treatment duration up to 28 cycles. A total of 1,867 women aged 18–50 were enrolled and took at least one dose of Natazia. [See Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ).] Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 11.5% of the women discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were metrorrhagia and irregular menstruation (1.9%), acne (1.2%), headache and migraine (1.0%), and weight increase (0.7 %). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 2%): headache (including migraines) (13.2%), metrorrhagia and irregular menstruation (8.0%), breast pain, discomfort or tenderness (6.6%), nausea or vomiting (6.5%), acne (3.9%) and increased weight (2.8%). Serious Adverse Reactions: deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, uterine leiomyoma, and ruptured ovarian cyst."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Vascular risks: Stop Natazia if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Natazia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Natazia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Natazia if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Natazia for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Natazia. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Natazia if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) CYP3A4 induction: Women taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. (5.13) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop COCs if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. Endometrial biopsies performed in a subset of subjects in a Phase 3 Natazia clinical trial did not reveal any unexpected or concerning findings for subjects taking COCs. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ).] 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Women who are not pregnant and use Natazia, may experience amenorrhea. Based on patient diaries, amenorrhea occurs in approximately 16% of cycles in women using Natazia. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea occurring in two or more consecutive cycles. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Based on patient diaries from three clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Natazia, 10-23% of women experienced intracyclic bleeding per cycle. A total of 38 subjects out of 2,266 (1.7%) discontinued due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the COC discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Drug Interactions Women who take medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Ashlyna. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: •barbiturates •bosentan •carbamazepine •felbamate •griseofulvin •oxcarbazepine •phenytoin •rifampin •St. John’s wort •topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in clinical trials for Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets are irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, weight gain, and acne. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Generics Inc., USA at 1 (888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women): irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency of establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Investigations: blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: dizziness, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders: dysmenorrhea Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Vascular disorders: thrombosis"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Vascular risks: Stop Ashlyna if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Ashlyna at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Ashlyna no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) •Liver disease: Discontinue Ashlyna if jaundice occurs. (5.3) •High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Ashlyna for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Ashlyna. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Ashlyna if indicated. (5.7) •Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Ashlyna if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Ashlyna provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop Ashlyna at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Ashlyna no earlier than 4-6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Ashlyna if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Ashlyna because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Ashlyna if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Ashlyna if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Ashlyna. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Ashlyna develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Ashlyna if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing Ashlyna, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Figure1 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Ashlyna discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Lo-Marzia. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Lo-Marzia was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects) The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver Disease: Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High Blood Pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri-Lo-Marzia. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. If feasible, stop Tri-Lo-Marzia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start Tri-Lo-Marzia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Lo-Marzia in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Lo-Marzia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Tri-Lo-Marzia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Lo-Marzia in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued Tri-Lo-Marzia, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using Tri-Lo-Marzia experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Lo-Marzia may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Lo-Marzia."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Kaitlib Fe. 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampicin St. John's wort topiramate HIV Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Ethinyl Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see BOXED WARNING, and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Kaitlib Fe for pregnancy prevention. The study was a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study with a treatment duration of 12 months (thirteen 28-day cycles). A total of 1,677 women aged 18 to 46 were enrolled and took at least one dose of Kaitlib Fe. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation 8.5% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.0%), weight increase (0.8%), acne (0.8%), metrorrhagia (0.7%), altered mood (0.4%), hypertension (0.4%), irritability (0.3%), migraine (0.3%), decreased libido (0.3%) and mood swings (0.3%). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of all treated subjects) Nausea/vomiting (8.8%), headaches/migraine (7.5%), depression/mood complaints (4.1%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), acne (3.2%), anxiety symptoms (2.4%), breast pain/tenderness (2.4%), and increased weight (2.3%). Serious Adverse Reactions Hypertension, depression, cholecystitis, and deep vein thrombosis."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Kaitlib Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding.(5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Kaitlib Fe. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Kaitlib Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Kaitlib Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Kaitlib Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Kaitlib Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Kaitlib Fe because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Kaitlib Fe if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Kaitlib Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease may be increased among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Kaitlib Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Kaitlib Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Kaitlib Fe if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Patient diaries from the clinical trial of Kaitlib Fe showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking Kaitlib Fe had unscheduled bleeding and/ or spotting. From Cycle 2 to 13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21 to 31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6 to 4.2 in cycles 2 to 13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation. Women who are not pregnant and use Kaitlib Fe may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2 to 13 was 3.7 days. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Kaitlib Fe use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Kaitlib Fe discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with CamreseLo. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. ( 7 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs Combination OCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Combination OCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see BOXED WARNING] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions for COCs are irregular uterine bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness, and headaches. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Women’s Health at 1-800-222-0190 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of CamreseLo was a 12-month, multicenter, non-comparative open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-41, of whom 2,185 took at least one dose of CamreseLo. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 11% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, headache, mood changes, nausea, acne, and weight gain. Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women): headaches (33%); irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (13%), dysmenorrhea (11%), nausea and/or vomiting (11%), back pain (8%)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop CamreseLo if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop CamreseLo at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start CamreseLo no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue CamreseLo if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe CamreseLo for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking CamreseLo. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue CamreseLo if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Vascular Events Stop COCs if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Use of CamreseLo provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year.) If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing CamreseLo, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of CamreseLo also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued CamreseLo, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2-3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking CamreseLo who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting (Based on Daily Diaries) Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.

Post-Marketing Experience A few cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body. A few cases of ring adherence to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have been reported. Vaginal wall ulceration or erosion should be carefully evaluated. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete in order to prevent the ring from adhering to the healing tissue. A few cases of bowel obstruction and vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Minastrin 24 Fe. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Warner Chilcott at 1-800-521-8813 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data presented in Section 6.1 are from a clinical trial conducted with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Minastrin 24 Fe is bioequivalent to these norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets. Common Adverse Reactions (Greater Than or Equal to 2% of all Treated Subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), abnormal cervical smear (3.1%), acne (2.7%), mood swings (2.2%), and weight gain (2.0%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol tablets, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal or irregular bleeding (1.3%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.5%), and increased blood pressure (0.4%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes. Vascular disorders: thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein). Hepatobiliary disorders: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma of liver. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction. Skin and subcutaneous disorders: alopecia, rash (generalized and allergic), pruritus, skin discoloration. GI disorders: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia. Eye disorders: blurred vision, visual impairment, corneal thinning, change in corneal curvature (steepening). Infections and infestations: fungal infection, vaginal infection. Investigations: change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease), fatigue, malaise, peripheral edema, blood pressure increased. Nervous system disorders: headache, dizziness, migraine, loss of consciousness. Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, depression, insomnia, anxiety, suicidal ideation, panic attack, changes in libido. Renal and urinary disorders: cystitis-like syndrome. Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast changes (tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion), premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea. Cardiovascular: chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, myocardial infarction."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs (5.2) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Minastrin 24 Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated (5.6) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Minastrin 24 Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop Minastrin 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Start Minastrin 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Minastrin 24 Fe in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Minastrin 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Minastrin 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Minastrin 24 Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Minastrin 24 Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets, 24-35% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. A total of 10 subjects out of 743 (1.3%) discontinued due to bleeding or spotting. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 24-day regimen of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets, 22 to 36% of the women using norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.020 mg tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets experienced amenorrhea in at least one of 6 cycles of use. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Minastrin 24 Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Minastrin 24 Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally-sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Minastrin 24 Fe."

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products: a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of combination oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma levels of estradiol associated with co-administered drugs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of combination oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation have been noted when these drugs were administered with combination oral contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events reported by 2 - 6% of the 743 women using Microgestin 24 Fe were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache, vaginal candidiasis, upper respiratory infection, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, sinusitis, vaginitis (bacterial), abnormal cervical smear, acne, urinary tract infection, mood swings, weight gain, vomiting, and metrorrhagia. Among the 743 women using Microgestin 24 Fe, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal bleeding (0.9%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.4%), increased blood pressure (0.4%), and irregular bleeding (0.4%). An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see WARNINGS section): Thrombophlebitis Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of oral contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema/fluid retention Melasma/chloasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion Change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease) Change in cervical ectropion and secretion Possible diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine headache Rash (allergic) Mood changes, including depression Vaginitis, including candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses Decrease in serum folate levels Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus Exacerbation of porphyria Exacerbation of chorea Aggravation of varicose veins Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives, and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Acne Budd-Chiari syndrome Cataracts Colitis Changes in libido Cystitis-like syndrome Dizziness Dysmenorrhea Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Headache Hemorrhagic eruption Hemolytic uremic syndrome Hirsutism Impaired renal function Loss of scalp hair Nervousness Optic neuritis, which may lead to partial or complete loss of vision Pancreatitis Premenstrual syndrome"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DRSP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the CYP system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro and clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Effects of Folates on Other Drugs Folates may modify the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain antifolate drugs, e.g., antiepileptics (such as phenytoin), methotrexate or pyrimethamine, and may result in a decreased pharmacological effect of the antifolate drug. 7.4 Effects of Other Drugs on Folates Several drugs have been reported to reduce folate concentrations by inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (e.g., methotrexate and sulfasalazine) or by reducing folate absorption (e.g., cholestyramine), or via unknown mechanisms (e.g., antiepileptics such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and valproic acid). 7.5 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]"

(6.1) •The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in PMDD clinical trials are menstrual irregularities (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception, Acne and Folate Supplementation Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of YAZ (3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE), in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056), for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536) and folate supplementation (N=379). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17-36 who took at least one dose of YAZ. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of YAZ on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18-35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14–45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of YAZ, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. For folate supplementation, the primary efficacy study using Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled US trial in 379 healthy women aged 18- 40 who were treated with Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium or YAZ for up to 24 weeks. The adverse reactions seen across the 3 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (5.9%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting], metrorrhagia and menorrhagia) (4.1%), nausea/vomiting (3.5%), and breast pain/tenderness (3.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the OC, Acne and Folate Supplementation studies as compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated safety and efficacy of YAZ during up to 3 cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD and who took at least one dose of YAZ. Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were:menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). Folate Clinical Trial Of 285 women, 4.6% who used Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium or YAZ discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; no reaction leading to discontinuation occurred in ≥ 1% of women. PMDD Clinical Trials Of 285 women, 11.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: nausea/vomiting (4.6%), menstrual irregularity (including vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, menstruation irregular and metrorrhagia) (4.2%), fatigue (1.8%), breast tenderness (1.4%), depression (1.4%), headache (1.1%), and irritability (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials Folate Supplementation Clinical Trial: cervix carcinoma stage 0 PMDD Clinical Trials: cervical dysplasia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of YAZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Vascular risks: Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) •Hyperkalemia: DRSP has antimineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.3) •Liver disease: Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if jaundice occurs. (5.4) •High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if indicated. (5.8) •Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin®), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied ComparatorProduct (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95%CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study b HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyc Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Fig 1 Fig 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data for Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium show the average number of episodes of bleeding per reference period (90 days) was 3.2 in Cycles 4-6. The average number of bleeding and/or spotting days with Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium was 15.1 days. The intensity of bleeding for Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium based on the ratio of spotting-only days versus total bleeding and/or spotting days was 5.2/15.1 days. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of YAZ®, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued YAZ due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from YAZ contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events reported by 2 to 6% of the 743 women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache, vaginal candidiasis, upper respiratory infection, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, sinusitis, vaginitis (bacterial), abnormal cervical smear, acne, urinary tract infection, mood swings, weight gain, vomiting, and metrorrhagia. Among the 743 women using norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal bleeding (0.9%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.4%), increased blood pressure (0.4%), and irregular bleeding (0.4%).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20% to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (greater than or equal to 2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: ● Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ● Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ● Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: ● Irregular uterine bleeding ● Nausea ● Breast tenderness ● Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (greater than or equal to 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%) , fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions: carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems ● Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. ● Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. ● If feasible, stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. ● Start norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. ● The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. ● Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. ● Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7% to 17% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix ● Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. ● Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM . Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. ( 6.1 )To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz, Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects) The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%) , fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if jaundice occurs. (5.2) • High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM . Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if indicated. (5.6) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems •Stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3High Blood Pressure Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6Headache If a woman taking Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.9Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix •Tri-Lo-EstaryllaTM is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted for Femring. Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism (7.1) 7.1 Metabolic Interactions In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin may decrease the plasma concentration of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase the plasma concentration of estrogens and may result in side effects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Disorders [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Malignant Neoplasms [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5 percent) are vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Warner Chilcott at 1-800-521-8813 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a 13-week clinical trial that included 225 postmenopausal women treated with Femring and 108 women treated with placebo vaginal rings, adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of ≥ 2 percent are summarized in Table 1.

A few cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body. 2. A few cases of ring adherence to the vaginal or bladder wall, making ring removal difficult, have been reported in women using vaginal rings. Patients should be carefully evaluated for vaginal or bladder wall ulceration or erosion. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete to prevent the ring from adhering to the vaginal tissue. 3. A few cases of bowel obstruction associated with vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated. 4. A few cases of inadvertent ring insertion into the urinary bladder, which may require surgical removal, have been reported for women using vaginal rings. Persistent unexplained urinary symptoms should be carefully evaluated. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Femring. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Genitourinary system Uterine cancer, vaginal hemorrhage, ovarian cyst, irregular menstruation, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, uterine enlargement. Breasts Breast cancer, fibrocystic breast disease, breast disorder, breast mass, breast enlargement, breast pain, nipple pain, breast discharge. Cardiovascular Chest pain, increased blood pressure, irregular heart rate, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), hemiparesis, transient ischemic attack, thrombosis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Femring is used only in the vagina, however, the risks associated with oral estrogens should be taken into account. Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (5.4) Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (5.5, 5.6, 5.9, 5.10) Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (5.11, 5.18) 5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 woman-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS) treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80)5 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86 and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors and prior mammogram results. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 5.3 Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary substudies were conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 5.6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 5.7 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.9 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. 5.11 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.12 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed. 5.13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered. 5.15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatic hemangiomas, and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. 5.17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. 5.18 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglycerides levels. Impaired glucose tolerance. 5.19 Vaginal Use and Expulsion Femring may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration, or make expulsions more likely, such as narrow vagina, vaginal stenosis, vaginal infection, cervical prolapse, rectoceles and cystoceles. If local treatment of a vaginal infection is required, Femring can remain in place during treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE concentrations by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentration. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DSRP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the CYP system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro and clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]",
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (> 2%) adverse reactions in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4.0%) and mood changes (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Contraception Clinical Trials : migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Vestura if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Vestura in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) Hyperkalemia: DRSP has antimineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.3) Liver disease: Discontinue Vestura if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Vestura for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Vestura. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Vestura if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Vestura if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin*), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Vestura in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin* (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin* Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins a) “New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months b) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate c) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone d) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin* Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-­analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE * Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY. If feasible, stop Vestura at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Vestura no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Vestura if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin* Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin* Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE 5.2 Hyperkalemia Vestura contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Vestura should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Vestura because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Vestura if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Vestura if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Vestura. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Vestura develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Vestura if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol tablets, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Vestura may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Vestura discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with LoSeasonique. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. ( 7 ) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs Combination OCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Combination OCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see BOXED WARNING] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1)] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions for COCs are irregular uterine bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness, and headaches. ( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Women’s Health at 1-800-222-0190 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of LoSeasonique was a 12-month, multicenter, non-comparative open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-41, of whom 2,185 took at least one dose of LoSeasonique. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 11% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, headache, mood changes, nausea, acne, and weight gain. Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women): headaches (33%); irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (13%), dysmenorrhea (11%), nausea and/or vomiting (11%), back pain (8%)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop LoSeasonique if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop LoSeasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start LoSeasonique no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue LoSeasonique if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe LoSeasonique for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking LoSeasonique. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue LoSeasonique if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Vascular Events Stop COCs if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Use of LoSeasonique provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year.) If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing LoSeasonique, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of LoSeasonique also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued LoSeasonique, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2-3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking LoSeasonique who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting (Based on Daily Diaries) Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin with certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitorsand non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DRSP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the CYP system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro and clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Effects of Folates on Other Drugs Folates may modify the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain antifolate drugs, e.g., antiepileptics (such as phenytoin), methotrexate or pyrimethamine, and may result in a decreased pharmacological effect of the antifolate drug. 7.4 Effects of Other Drugs on Folates Several drugs have been reported to reduce folate concentrations by inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (e.g., methotrexate and sulfasalazine) or by reducing folate absorption (e.g., cholestyramine), or via unknown mechanisms (e.g., antiepileptics such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and valproic acid). 7.5 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in contraception and folate clinical trials are premenstrual syndrome (12.4%), headache/migraine (10.3%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.1%), nausea/vomiting (4.4%), mood changes (2.3%) and abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Folate Supplementation Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837) and folate supplementation (N=172). For contraception, the US pivotal clinical study (N=326) for the oral contraception indication for Yasmin was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 -35 who were treated with Yasmin for up to 13 cycles. The second contraceptive pivotal study (N=442) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of Yasmin vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17-40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The primary efficacy study using Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium for folate supplementation was a randomized, single-center European trial in 172 healthy, female subjects aged 18-40 years comparing the pharmacodynamic effects of Yasmin + 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium to Yasmin co-administered with folic acid during 24 weeks of treatment followed by 20 weeks of open-label Yasmin. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (12.4%), headache/migraine (10.3%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.1%), nausea/vomiting (4.4%), mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%), and abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Contraception Clinical Trials Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Folate Clinical Trial There were no subjects who discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Serious Adverse Reactions: Contraception Clinical Trials: depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. Folate Supplementation Clinical Trial: none reported in the clinical trial 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Yasmin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has antimineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.3) • Liver disease: Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin®), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1:Estimates(Hazard Ratios)ofVenous ThromboembolismRisk in CurrentUsersof YasminCompared to Users of OralContraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied ComparatorProduct (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95%CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study b HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyc Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Fig 1 Fig 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten Yasmin contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 –13, 1 - 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. Discontinue Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Drospirenone/Ethinyl Estradiol/Levomefolate Calcium and Levomefolate Calcium discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "8. Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and bosentan. Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases.The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Concurrent use of bosentan and ethinyl estradiol containing products may result in decreased concentrations of these contraceptive hormones thereby increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy and unscheduled bleeding. Increase in plasma levels associated with co-administered drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see WARNINGS Section). Thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without embolism Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of oral contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug-related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema Melasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, enlargement, secretion Change in weight (increase or decrease) Change in cervical erosion and secretion Diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine Allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria, angioedema Mental depression Reduced tolerance to carbohydrates Vaginal candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Pre-menstrual syndrome Cataracts Changes in appetite Cystitis-like syndrome Headache Nervousness Dizziness Hirsutism Loss of scalp hair Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Hemorrhagic eruption Vaginitis Porphyria Impaired renal function Hemolytic uremic syndrome Acne Changes in libido Colitis Budd-Chiari Syndrome"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets vs. 0.15 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/ tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyb HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyc Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study d Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) a)“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months b)Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate c)Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone d)Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish reanalysis [Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. figure1 figure2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycim [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with MonoNessa or TriNessa. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: MonoNessa: headache/migraine, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, vaginal infection, genital discharge, breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered), flatulence, nervousness, rash. (6.1) TriNessa: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. MonoNessa The safety of MonoNessa was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of MonoNessa for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5.0%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5.0%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). TriNessa The safety of TriNessa was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of TriNessa for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop MonoNessa or TriNessa if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop MonoNessa or TriNessa if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking MonoNessa or TriNessa. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop MonoNessa or TriNessa if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. Stop MonoNessa or TriNessa if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If feasible, stop MonoNessa or TriNessa at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start MonoNessa or TriNessa no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use MonoNessa or TriNessa in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors MonoNessa and TriNessa are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure MonoNessa and TriNessa are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop MonoNessa and TriNessa if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take MonoNessa or TriNessa. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking MonoNessa or TriNessa develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa if indicated. Consider discontinuation of MonoNessa or TriNessa in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of MonoNessa and TriNessa, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued MonoNessa and 231 (4.8%) women discontinued TriNessa, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14–34% of women using MonoNessa experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year; for TriNessa, the respective numbers were 13–38%. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use MonoNessa or TriNessa may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix MonoNessa and TriNessa are contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking MonoNessa or TriNessa."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Gianvi with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]"

Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Gianvi in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 – 36 who took at least one dose of Gianvi. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of Gianvi on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18–35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14–45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of Gianvi, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the Contraception and Acne studies as compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated safety and efficacy of Gianvi during up to 3 cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD and who took at least one dose of Gianvi. Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Of 285 women, 11.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: nausea/vomiting (4.6%), menstrual irregularity (including vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, menstruation irregular and metrorrhagia) (4.2%), fatigue (1.8%), breast tenderness (1.4%), depression (1.4%), headache (1.1%), and irritability (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials PMDD Clinical Trials: cervical dysplasia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Gianvi. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Gianvi if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Gianvi in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Gianvi if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Gianvi for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Gianvi. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Gianvi if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Gianvi if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Gianvi in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Gianvi at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Gianvi no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Gianvi if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] fig 1 Figure 2 Likelihood of Developing a VTE 5.2 Hyperkalemia Gianvi contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Gianvi is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Gianvi because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Gianvi if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra‑abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long‑term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Gianvi if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Gianvi. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Gianvi develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Gianvi if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of Gianvi, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Gianvi may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb‑reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Gianvi discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted for Angeliq. •Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration (7.1) •Serum potassium concentration may increase in women taking drospirenone with other drugs that have the potential to increase potassium (7.1) 7.1 Metabolic Interactions Effect of Drospirenone on Other Drugs The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. No significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrated that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two further clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4, respectively, were performed and the results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady-state DRSP concentrations. Co-administration of DRSP and drugs that may increase serum potassium: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking DRSP with other drugs that may affect electrolytes, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or NSAIDs, more pronounced in diabetic women [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Electrolytes were studied in postmenopausal women with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus requiring an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. After 28 days of exposure to 1 mg E2 and 3 mg DRSP (n=112) or placebo (n=118). The mean change from baseline in serum potassium was 0.11 mEq/L for the E2/DRSP group and 0.08 mEq/L for the placebo group. None of the subjects with serum potassium concentrations ≥5.5 mEq/L had cardiovascular adverse events. A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/E2 1 mg versus placebo was performed in mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium concentrations were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium concentrations in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.01 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations >5.5 mEq/L). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the Angeliq clinical trials. Effect of Other Drugs on Estrogens and Progestins In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens and progestins are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/E2 1.5 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of exposure and a mild increase of peak concentration for DRSP. The E2 exposure and peak concentration were unaffected by ketoconazole, although the exposure and peak concentration of estrone (E1) increased. Although no clinically relevant effects on any safety or laboratory parameters including serum potassium were observed, this study only assessed subjects for 10 days. The clinical impact for a woman taking a DRSP-containing combination hormone and chronic use of a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is unknown. Substances decreasing the exposure and possibly diminishing the efficacy of estrogens and progestins (enzyme inducers) Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens and progestins, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Substances increasing the exposure of estrogens and progestins (enzyme inhibitors) Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (for example, clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice did increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. HIV/HCV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 7.2 Interaction with Alcohol Acute alcohol ingestion during use of hormone therapy may lead to elevations of circulating E2 concentrations."

From clinical trials with different dose formulations of Angeliq containing E2 dose ranging from 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg combined with DRSP dose ranging from 0.25 mg to 3 mg: •The most common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal and abdominal pain, female genital bleeding, breast pain and headache. The frequencies of common adverse reactions, in general, were higher for the Angeliq dose formulation containing E2 1 mg compared to Angeliq containing E2 0.5 mg. •The most common adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation in controlled clinical trials were abdominal pain, headache, postmenopausal bleeding, breast tenderness, and weight increased. Placebo-Controlled Trial: In a placebo-controlled trial evaluating Angeliq 0.25 mg DRSP/0.5 mg E2, 183 postmenopausal women received at least one dose of DRSP 0.25 mg/0.5 mg E2 and 180 received placebo. Study subjects were treated for 3 cycles of 28 days each for a total of 12 weeks of treatment. The median age was 53 years (range: 40-77 years) and over 50% of subjects had a hysterectomy, 68% were Caucasian and 24% were Black. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of subjects receiving Angeliq 0.25 mg DRS/0.5 mg E2 and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Do not use with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (5.2) •Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (5.5) •Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10) •Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (5.11, 5.19) 5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI have been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. An increased risk of stroke and DVT have been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and/or obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) [for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, systemic lupus erythematosus] should be managed appropriately. Stroke In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women years) [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on CHD events was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE 0.625 mg compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n=2,763), average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS]), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted3 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years4 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately. If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.2 Hyperkalemia Angeliq contains the progestin DRSP that has antialdosterone activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients. Angeliq is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Use caution when prescribing Angeliq to women who regularly take other medications that can increase potassium, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, heparin and aldosterone antagonists. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentrations during the first month of dosing in high-risk patients who take strong CYP3A4 inhibitors long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors (for example, indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24 and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86 and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09 and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups5 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 In some epidemiological studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 5.4 Probable Dementia In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.6 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium concentration. 5.7 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.9 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued. The clearance of drospirenone was decreased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 5.11 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone concentrations in an acceptable range. 5.12 Fluid Retention Estrogens and progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. 5.13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur. 5.14 Hyponatremia As an aldosterone antagonist, drospirenone may increase the possibility of hyponatremia in high-risk patients. 5.15 Exacerbation of Endometriosis Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. 5.16 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. 5.17 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus otosclerosis, chorea minor and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions. In women with hereditary angioedema exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.18 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol concentrations have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. 5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII–X complex, II–VII–X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased concentrations of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased concentrations of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased TBG concentrations leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 concentrations (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 concentrations by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin, leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-l-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglyceride concentrations. Impaired glucose tolerance. Reduced response to metyrapone test."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Seasonique. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in clinical trials for Seasonique are irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, weight gain, and acne. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Duramed Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-222-0190 or FDA 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Seasonique was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Seasonique. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women): irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Seasonique. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency of establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Investigations: blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: dizziness, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders: dysmenorrhea Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Vascular disorders: thrombosis"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Seasonique if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Seasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Seasonique no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Seasonique if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Seasonique for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Seasonique. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Seasonique if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Seasonique if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Seasonique provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop Seasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Seasonique no earlier than 4-6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Seasonique if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Seasonique because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Seasonique if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Seasonique if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Seasonique. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Seasonique develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Seasonique if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing Seasonique, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Seasonique also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Seasonique, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28-Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 10 6.9 1.7 4th 0 1 4 3.2 0.8 Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting. 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28-Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 11 7.4 1.9 4th 0 2 7 4.4 1.1 Figure 1 shows the percentage of Seasonique subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Seasonique who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Seasonique discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1.

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [for example, nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [for example, indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [for example, boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [for example, nevirapine] or increase [for example, etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (for example, cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in clinical trials were nausea/vomiting, headache, bleeding irregularities, dysmenorrhea, weight change, breast tenderness, acne, abdominal pain, anxiety and depression (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Warner Chilcott at 1-800-521-8813 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data presented in Section 6.1 are from a clinical trial conducted with a 28-day regimen consisting of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 24 days followed with ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 2 days and ferrous fumarate tablets for 2 days. Lo Minastrin Fe is bioequivalent to this 28-day regimen. A multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 28-day regimen for pregnancy prevention. The study was a one year, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled study. A total of 1,660 women aged 18 to 45 were enrolled and took at least one dose of the 28-day regimen and 1,582 had at least one post-treatment evaluation [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Common Adverse Reactions (Greater Than or Equal to 2% of all Treated Subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,660 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: nausea/vomiting (7%), headache (7%), bleeding irregularities (including metrorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage and dysfunctional uterine bleeding) (5%), dysmenorrhea (4%), weight fluctuation (4%), breast tenderness (4%), acne (3%), abdominal pain (3%), anxiety (2%), and depression (2%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 10.7% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were in decreasing order: menstrual irregularities (including metrorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (4%), headache/migraine (1%), mood disorder (including mood swings, depression, anxiety) (1%), and weight fluctuation (1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: deep vein thrombosis, ovarian vein thrombosis, cholecystitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of a 28-day regimen consisting of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 24 days followed with ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 2 days and ferrous fumarate tablets for 2 days. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes. Vascular disorders: thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein) Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Skin and subcutaneous tissues: urticaria, rash, pruritis Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/discomfort, diarrhea Nervous system disorders: headache, dizziness, migraine headache Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, depression, anxiety Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, dyspnea Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast enlargement, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, irregular menstruation, metrorrhagia"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Vascular risks: Stop Lo Minastrin Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1) •Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs (5.2) •High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Lo Minastrin Fe if blood pressure rises significantly (5.3) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Lo Minastrin Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (5.5) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated (5.6) •Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Lo Minastrin Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Lo Minastrin Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop Lo Minastrin Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Start Lo Minastrin Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Lo Minastrin Fe in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompressed) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Lo Minastrin Fe if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Lo Minastrin Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Lo Minastrin Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Lo Minastrin Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Lo Minastrin Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Lo Minastrin Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Lo Minastrin Fe if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Lo Minastrin Fe in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 28-day regimen consisting of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 24 days followed with ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 2 days and ferrous fumarate tablets for 2 days, 36-53% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle. Among these women, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting during a 28-day cycle ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 days. A total of 58 subjects out of 1,582 discontinued the study due to bleeding or spotting. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use Lo Minastrin Fe may experience amenorrhea. In the clinical trial with a 28-day regimen consisting of norethindrone acetate 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 24 days followed with ethinyl estradiol 10 mcg tablets for 2 days and ferrous fumarate tablets for 2 days, 31-49% of the women experienced amenorrhea in at least one cycle between Cycles 2 to 13. Some women may experience post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Lo Minastrin Fe if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Lo Minastrin Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Lo Minastrin Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Lo Minastrin Fe."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Estarylla™. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine.

(6.1) Tri-Estarylla™: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz, Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Estarylla™ was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Tri-Estarylla™ for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl.

(5.3) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri-Estarylla™. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Estarylla™ if indicated. (5.6) •Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems •Stop Tri-Estarylla™ if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop Tri-Estarylla™ if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Tri-Estarylla™ at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Tri-Estarylla™ no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Estarylla™ in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Estarylla™ if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Estarylla™ is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Tri-Estarylla™ is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Estarylla™ if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Estarylla™. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Tri-Estarylla™ develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Estarylla™ if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Estarylla™ in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of Tri-Estarylla™, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 231 (4.8%) women discontinued Tri-Estarylla™ at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 13 to 38% of women using Tri-Estarylla™ experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Estarylla™ may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.

Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Estarylla™."

        "8. Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Rifampin: Metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and some progestins (e.g., norethindrone) is increased by rifampin. A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and an increase in menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. Minocycline: Minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progesterone, FSH and LH plasma levels, breakthrough bleeding, or contraceptive failure cannot be ruled out. Anticonvulsants: Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine have been shown to increase the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and/or some progestins, which could result in a reduction of contraceptive effectiveness. Antibiotics: Pregnancy while taking combined hormonal contraceptives has been reported when the combined hormonal contraceptives were administered with antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, and griseofulvin. However, clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not demonstrated any consistent effects of antibiotics (other than rifampin-see above) on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. See also separate discussion on minocycline (above). Atorvastatin: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively. St. John’s Wort: Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and emergency contraceptive pills. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Other: Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma concentrations of some synthetic estrogens, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Effects of Drospirenone on Other Drugs Metabolic Interactions Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies (see Metabolism). In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady-state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Interactions with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs (see BOLDED WARNING). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the clinical trials with 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets. A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium levels were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium levels in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple timepoints over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.01 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.08), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations >5.5 mEq/L). Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs Combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. In addition, oral contraceptives may induce the conjugation of other compounds. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance on temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives."

        "8. Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other drugs: a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include barbiturates, rifampin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. Since desogestrel is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP 2C9) to form etonogestrel, the active progestin, there is a possibility of interaction with CYP 2C9 substrates or inhibitors (such as ibuprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, phenytoin, fluconazole, diclofenac, tolbutamide, glipizide, celecoxib, sulfamethoxazole, isoniazid, torsemide, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan). The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The efficacy and safety of these oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7) No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs Combination OCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Combination OCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact www.birthcontrolhealth.com Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 and FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking[see BOXED WARNING] Vascular events[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets was a 12-month, multicenter, non-comparative open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-41, of whom 2,185 took at least one dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation 11% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, headache, mood changes, nausea, acne, and weight gain. Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women) headaches (33%); irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (13%), dysmenorrhea (11%), nausea and/or vomiting (11%), back pain (8%)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Vascular Events Stop COCs if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year.) If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2-3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled Bleeding Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 0 5 11 7.5 2.5 4th 0 0 5 3.5 1.2 Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 3 10 19 14.0 4.7 4th 0 3 10 6.5 2.2 Figure 1 shows the percentage of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects participating in the primary clinical trial with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or just unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting (Based on Daily Diaries) Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. fig 1"

The most frequent system-organ class adverse events leading to discontinuation in one to 2.5% of women using NuvaRing® in the trials included the following: device-related events (foreign body sensation, coital problems, device expulsion), vaginal symptoms (discomfort/vaginitis/vaginal secretion), headache, emotional lability, and weight gain. Listed below are adverse reactions that have been associated with the use of combination hormonal contraceptives. These are also likely to apply to combination vaginal hormonal contraceptives, such as NuvaRing®. An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of combination hormonal contraceptives (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS): Thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without embolism Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of combination hormonal contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in users of combination hormonal contraceptives and are believed to be drug-related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema/fluid retention Melasma/chloasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion Decrease in serum folate levels Exacerbation of porphyria Aggravation of varicose veins Change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease) Change in cervical ectropion and secretion Possible diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine headache Rash (allergic) Mood changes, including depression Vaginitis, including candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus Exacerbation of chorea Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in users of combination hormonal contraceptives and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Pre-menstrual syndrome Cataracts Cystitis-like syndrome Headache Nervousness Dizziness Hirsutism Loss of scalp hair Erythema multiforme Dysmenorrhea Pancreatitis Erythema nodosum Hemorrhagic eruption Impaired renal function Hemolytic uremic syndrome Acne Changes in libido Colitis Budd-Chiari Syndrome Optic neuritis, which may lead to partial or complete loss of vision"

        "8.Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. •Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Beyaz with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Effects of Folates on Other Drugs Folates may modify the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain antifolate drugs, e.g., antiepileptics (such as phenytoin), methotrexate or pyrimethamine, and may result in a decreased pharmacological effect of the antifolate drug. 7.4 Effects of Other Drugs on Folates Several drugs have been reported to reduce folate concentrations by inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (e.g., methotrexate and sulfasalazine) or by reducing folate absorption (e.g., cholestyramine), or via unknown mechanisms (e.g., antiepileptics such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and valproic acid). 7.5 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2).]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache •The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in contraception, acne and folate clinical trials are headache/migraine (5.9%), menstrual irregularities (4.1%), nausea/vomiting (3.5%) and breast pain/tenderness (3.2%). (6.1) •The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in PMDD clinical trials are menstrual irregularities (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception, Acne and Folate Supplementation Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of YAZ (3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE), in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056), for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536) and folate supplementation (N=379). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17–36 who took at least one dose of YAZ. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of YAZ on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18–35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14–45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of YAZ, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. For folate supplementation, the primary efficacy study using Beyaz was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled US trial in 379 healthy women aged 18–40 who were treated with Beyaz or YAZ for up to 24 weeks. The adverse reactions seen across the 3 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (5.9%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting], metrorrhagia and menorrhagia) (4.1%), nausea/vomiting (3.5%), and breast pain/tenderness (3.2%). PMDD Clinical Trials Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the OC, Acne and Folate Supplementation studies as compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two (one parallel and one crossover designed) multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated safety and efficacy of YAZ during up to 3 cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD and who took at least one dose of YAZ. Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%) . Folate Clinical Trial Of 285 women, 4.6% who used Beyaz or YAZ discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; no reaction leading to discontinuation occurred in ≥ 1% of women. PMDD Clinical Trials Of 285 women, 11.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were: nausea/vomiting (4.6%), menstrual irregularity (including vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, menstruation irregular and metrorrhagia) (4.2%), fatigue (1.8%), breast tenderness (1.4%), depression (1.4%), headache (1.1%), and irritability (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials Folate Supplementation Clinical Trial: cervix carcinoma stage 0 PMDD Clinical Trials: cervical dysplasia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of YAZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Beyaz if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Beyaz in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Beyaz if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Beyaz for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Beyaz. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Beyaz if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Beyaz if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Beyaz in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users\"New users\" - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Beyaz at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Beyaz no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Beyaz if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] figure 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Beyaz contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Beyaz is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Beyaz because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Beyaz if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Beyaz if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Beyaz. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Beyaz develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Beyaz if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data for Beyaz show the average number of episodes of bleeding per reference period (90 days) was 3.2 in Cycles 4-6. The average number of bleeding and/or spotting days with Beyaz was 15.1 days. The intensity of bleeding for Beyaz based on the ratio of spotting-only days versus total bleeding and/or spotting days was 5.2/15.1 days. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of YAZ, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued YAZ due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Beyaz may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from YAZ contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Beyaz if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Beyaz discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Sprintec. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Sprintec was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Tri-Sprintec for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Tri-Sprintec if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver Disease: Discontinue Tri-Sprintec if jaundice occurs. (5.2) • High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri-Sprintec. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Sprintecif indicated. (5.6) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems •Stop Tri-Sprintec if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop Tri-Sprintec if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Tri-Sprintec at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Tri-Sprintec no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Sprintec in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Sprintec if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Sprintec is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Tri-Sprintec is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Sprintec. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Tri-Sprintec develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Sprintec if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Sprintecin the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of Tri-Sprintec, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles). A total of 231 (4.8%) women discontinued Tri-Sprintec, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 13 to 38% of women using Tri-Sprintec experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Sprintec may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Sprintec use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Sprintec if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix •Tri-Sprintec is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. •Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Sprintec."

TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body. A few cases of ring adherence to the vaginal or bladder wall, making ring removal difficult, have been reported in women using vaginal rings. Patients should be carefully evaluated for vaginal or bladder wall ulceration or erosion. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete to prevent the ring from adhering to the vaginal tissue. A few cases of bowel obstruction associated with vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated. A few cases of inadvertent ring insertion into the urinary bladder, which may require surgical removal, have been reported for women using vaginal rings. Persistent unexplained urinary symptoms should be carefully evaluated. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Femring.

This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

(6.1) Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1(888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg The safety of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5.0%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5.0%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg The safety of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Click here to enter Warnings and Precautions • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.2) • High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.6) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems •Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, and Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, and 231 (4.8%) women discontinued Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14-34% of women using Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year; for Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets, 0.18 mg/0.035 mg, 0.215 mg/0.035 mg, 0.25 mg/0.035 mg, the respective numbers were 13-38%. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix •Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. •Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets."

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products: a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or break-through bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of combination oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma levels of estradiol associated with co-administered drugs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of combination oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation have been noted when these drugs were administered with combination oral contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events reported by 2 to 6% of the 743 women using Lomedia 24 Fe were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache, vaginal candidiasis, upper respiratory infection, nausea, menstrual cramps, breast tenderness, sinusitis, vaginitis (bacterial), abnormal cervical smear, acne, urinary tract infection, mood swings, weight gain, vomiting, and metrorrhagia. Among the 743 women using Lomedia 24 Fe, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal bleeding (0.9%), nausea (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.4%), increased blood pressure (0.4%), and irregular bleeding (0.4%). An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see WARNINGS section): Thrombophlebitis Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of oral contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema/fluid retention Melasma/chloasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion Change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease) Change in cervical ectropion and secretion Possible diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine headache Rash (allergic) Mood changes, including depression Vaginitis, including candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses Decrease in serum folate levels Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus Exacerbation of porphyria Exacerbation of chorea Aggravation of varicose veins Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives, and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Acne Budd-Chiari syndrome Cataracts Colitis Changes in libido Cystitis-like syndrome Dizziness Dysmenorrhea Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Headache Hemorrhagic eruption Hemolytic uremic syndrome Hirsutism Impaired renal function Loss of scalp hair Nervousness Optic neuritis, which may lead to partial or complete loss of vision Pancreatitis Premenstrual syndrome"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]."

The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular Disorders Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary Disorders Gallbladder disease Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hyperkalemia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Chloasma"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks : Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) Liver disease : Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure : Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins a)“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months b) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate c) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone d) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel Epidemiologic Study ( Author , Year of Publication ) Population Studied Comparator Product ( all are low - dose COCs ; with ≤ 0 . 04 mg of EE ) Hazard Ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % CI ) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study b HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyc Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. * Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study # Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablet is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy and [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1 Figure 2"

        "8. Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin and bosentan. Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Concurrent use of bosentan and ethinyl estradiol-containing products may result in decreased concentrations of these contraceptive hormones, thereby increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy and unscheduled bleeding. Increase in plasma levels associated with co-administered drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. Combined hormonal contraceptives have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine when co-administered due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.101 Healthcare professionals are advised to also refer to prescribing information of co-administered drugs for recommendations regarding management of concomitant therapy."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (see WARNINGS). Thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without embolism Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of oral contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug-related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema Melasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, enlargement, secretion Change in weight (increase or decrease) Change in cervical erosion and secretion Diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine Allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria, angioedema Mental depression Reduced tolerance to carbohydrates Vaginal candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Pre-menstrual syndrome Cataracts Changes in appetite Cystitis-like syndrome Headache Nervousness Dizziness Hirsutism Loss of scalp hair Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Hemorrhagic eruption Vaginitis Porphyria Impaired renal function Hemolytic uremic syndrome Acne Changes in libido Colitis Budd-Chiari Syndrome"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Seasonique. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in clinical trials for Seasonique are irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, weight gain, and acne. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-832-8537 or FDA 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Seasonique was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Seasonique. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women): irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Seasonique. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency of establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Investigations: blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: dizziness, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders: dysmenorrhea Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Vascular disorders: thrombosis"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Seasonique if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Seasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Seasonique no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Seasonique if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Seasonique for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Seasonique. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Seasonique if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Seasonique if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Seasonique provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop Seasonique at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Seasonique no earlier than 4-6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Seasonique if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Seasonique because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Seasonique if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Seasonique if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Seasonique. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Seasonique develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Seasonique if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing Seasonique, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Seasonique also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Seasonique, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle.

Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Seasonique who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Seasonique discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin with certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV ) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Effect on DRSP: The main metabolites of DRSP in human plasma are generated without involvement of the CYP system. Inhibitors of this enzyme system are therefore unlikely to influence the metabolism of DRSP. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. In vitro and clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Yasmin with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity[ see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 -35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of Yasmin vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17-40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Yasmin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Yasmin if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Hyperkalemia: DRSP has antimineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.3) Liver disease: Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Yasmin for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Yasmin. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Yasmin if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. The use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Yasmin at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Yasmin no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Yasmin if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. Epidemiologic studies including a DRSP-containing COC Several studies have investigated the relative risks of thromboembolism in women using Yasmin compared to those in women using COCs containing other progestins. Two prospective cohort studies, both evaluating the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism and death, were initiated at the time of Yasmin approval.1,2 The first (EURAS) showed the risk of thromboembolism (particularly venous thromboembolism) and death in Yasmin users to be comparable to that of other oral contraceptive preparations, including those containing levonorgestrel (a so-called second generation COC). The second prospective cohort study (Ingenix) also showed a comparable risk of thromboembolism in Yasmin users compared to users of other COCs, including those containing levonorgestrel. In the second study, COC comparator groups were selected based on their having similar characteristics to those being prescribed Yasmin. Two additional epidemiological studies, one case-control study (van Hylckama Vlieg et al. 3) and one retrospective cohort study (Lidegaard et al. 4) suggested that the risk of venous thromboembolism occurring in Yasmin users was higher than that for users of levonorgestrel-containing COCs and lower than that for users of desogestrel/gestodene-containing COCs (so-called third generation COCs). In the case-control study, however, the number of Yasmin cases was very small (1.2% of all cases) making the risk estimates unreliable. The relative risk for Yasmin users in the retrospective cohort study was greater than that for users of other COC products when considering women who used the products for less than one year. However, these one-year estimates may not be reliable because the analysis may include women of varying risk levels. Among women who used the product for 1 to 4 years, the relative risk was similar for users of Yasmin to that for users of other COC products. 5.2 Hyperkalemia Yasmin contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Yasmin should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Yasmin because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term ( 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Yasmin if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Yasmin. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Yasmin develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the Yasmin trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use Yasmin may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yasmin discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin with certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Safyral with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Effects of Folates on Other Drugs Folates may modify the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain antifolate drugs, e.g., antiepileptics (such as phenytoin), methotrexate or pyrimethamine, and may result in a decreased pharmacological effect of the antifolate drug. 7.4 Effects of Other Drugs on Folates Several drugs have been reported to reduce folate concentrations by inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (e.g., methotrexate and sulfasalazine) or by reducing folate absorption (e.g., cholestyramine), or via unknown mechanisms (e.g., antiepileptics such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and valproic acid). 7.5 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.

Contraception and Folate Supplementation Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837) and folate supplementation (N=172). For contraception, the US pivotal clinical study (N=326) for the oral contraception indication for Yasmin was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18–35 who were treated with Yasmin for up to 13 cycles. The second contraceptive pivotal study (N=442) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of Yasmin vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17–40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The primary efficacy study using Safyral for folate supplementation was a randomized, single-center European trial in 172 healthy, female subjects aged 18–40 years comparing the pharmacodynamic effects of Yasmin + 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium to Yasmin co-administered with folic acid during 24 weeks of treatment followed by 20 weeks of open-label Yasmin. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (12.4%), headache/migraine (10.3%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.1%), nausea/vomiting (4.4%), mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%), and abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Contraception Clinical Trials Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Folate Clinical Trial There were no subjects who discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Serious Adverse Reactions: Contraception Clinical Trials: depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. Folate Supplementation Clinical Trial: none reported in the clinical trial 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Yasmin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Safyral if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Safyral in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Safyral if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Safyral for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Safyral. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Safyral if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Safyral if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Safyral in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users\"New users\" - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Safyral at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Safyral no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Safyral if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] figure 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Safyral contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Safyral is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Safyral because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Safyral if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Safyral if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Safyral. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Safyral develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Safyral if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten Yasmin contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin and Safyral trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%–88%) was 4–7 days. Women who use Safyral may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1–11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. Discontinue Safyral if pregnancy is confirmed and initiate a prenatal vitamin containing folate supplementation. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Safyral discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Folates may mask vitamin B12 deficiency. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Quartette. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in clinical trials for Quartette were headaches, heavy/irregular vaginal bleeding, nausea/vomiting, acne, dysmenorrhea, weight increased, mood changes, anxiety/panic attack, breast pain and migraines (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-832-8537 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below are from a 12-month, US, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 3,597 took at least one dose of Quartette (2,661 woman-years of exposure) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 13.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were heavy/irregular bleeding (5.0%), mood swings/alteration/affect lability (1.4%), headaches/migraines (1.3%), weight increased (1.3%) and acne (1.0%). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of women): headaches (12.2%), heavy/irregular vaginal bleeding (9.7%), nausea/vomiting (8.8%), acne (5.4%), dysmenorrhea (5.4%), weight increased (4.6%), mood changes (depression, depressed mood, crying, major depression, affective disorder, depression suicidal, dysthymic disorder) (2.9%), anxiety/panic attack (2.4%), breast tenderness/pain/discomfort (2.2%), migraine (2.0%). Serious Adverse Reactions (≥ 2 women): Abortion Spontaneous, Suicide Attempt, Cholecystitis/ Cholelithiasis, Deep Vein Thrombosis, Ectopic Pregnancy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of other extended-cycle COCs containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Investigations: blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: dizziness, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders: dysmenorrhea Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Vascular disorders: thrombosis",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Vascular risks: Stop Quartette if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Quartette at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Quartette no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) •Liver disease: Discontinue Quartette if jaundice occurs. (5.2) •High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Quartette for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.3) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Quartette. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.5) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Quartette if indicated. (5.6) •Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Quartette if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Quartette if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop Quartette at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Start Quartette no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4-week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Quartette provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). In the clinical trial, three cases of deep vein thrombosis were reported. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Quartette in women with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Quartette if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Quartette is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Quartette is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Quartette if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Quartette. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Quartette develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Quartette if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Quartette in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets (light pink, pink and purple) of each extended-cycle regimen is considered “unscheduled” bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven tablets (yellow) containing 10 mcg of ethinyl estradiol is considered “scheduled” bleeding. Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on Quartette, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Before prescribing Quartette, consider the occurrence of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. A 12-month open-label study of the efficacy of Quartette in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,597 women who completed 34,087 28-day cycles of exposure. A total of 178 (4.9%) of the women discontinued Quartette, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly stable over time, with an average of 3 to 4 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle.

Figure 1: Percent of Women Taking Quartette Who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use Quartette may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 1.9% of women during Cycle 1, 7.7% during Cycle 2, 10.7% during Cycle 3, and 10.1% during Cycle 4 using Quartette. Rule out pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Figure 1 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Quartette if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Quartette if depression recurs to a serious degree. Six cases of suicidality (suicide attempts and suicidal behavior) were reported in the clinical trial; several of these cases occurred in women with a psychiatric history. 5.10 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Quartette is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occur with COC use, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Advise women who tend to develop chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Quartette.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18–45 (nonsmoker if 35–45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%) , fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: In the clinical trial of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions: carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop ORTHO TRI‑CYCLEN Lo if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Stop ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If feasible, stop ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if indicated. Consider discontinuation of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7–17% of women using ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN Lo."

The serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol were not affected by concomitant administration of oral amoxicillin or doxycycline in standard dosages during 10 days of antibiotic treatment. The effects of other antibiotics on etonogestrel or ethinyl estradiol concentrations have not been evaluated. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Co-administration of vaginal miconazole nitrate and NuvaRing increases the serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol by up to 40% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and /or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of CHCs on Other Drugs CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control, therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

(5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop NuvaRing use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop NuvaRing use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] If feasible, stop NuvaRing at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization. Start NuvaRing no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)]. Two epidemiologic studies1, 2, 3 that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of NuvaRing are described below. In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, NuvaRing users had a risk of VTE similar to COC users (see Table 1 for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of NuvaRing (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting NuvaRing or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among NuvaRing users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY. A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of NuvaRing to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel. 8.2 events per 10,000 WY. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Users of NuvaRing Compared to Users of Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product(s) Hazard Ratios (HR) (95% CI) TASC (Dinger, 2012) Initiators, including new users, switchers and restarters All COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, ethynodiol diacetate, gestodene, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, norgestimate, or norgestrel COCs available excluding DSG- or GSD -containing OCs HRAdjusted for age, BMI, duration of use, VTE history: 0.8 (0.5-1.5) HR: 0.8 (0.4-1.7) FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases (Sidney, 2011) First use of a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) during the study period COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HRAdjusted for age, site, year of entry into study: 1.1 (0.6-2.2) LNG/0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol HR: 1.0 (0.5-2.0) An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of CHCs is well-established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1). The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE *CHC=combination hormonal contraception **Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY. Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in NuvaRing, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk. Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. Use NuvaRing with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Figure 1 5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) Cases of TSS have been reported by NuvaRing users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the NuvaRing users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of NuvaRing and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment. 5.3 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use NuvaRing in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Discontinue NuvaRing use if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors NuvaRing is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (>8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users. 5.4 High Blood Pressure NuvaRing is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop NuvaRing use if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Vaginal Use NuvaRing may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration. Vaginal/cervical erosion or ulceration in women using NuvaRing has been reported. In some cases, the ring adhered to vaginal tissue, necessitating removal by a healthcare provider. Some women are aware of the ring on occasion during the 21 days of use or during intercourse, and sexual partners may feel NuvaRing in the vagina. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using NuvaRing. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Some women will have adverse lipid changes while on CHCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using CHCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman using NuvaRing develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue NuvaRing if indicated. Consider discontinuation of NuvaRing in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC. Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512). Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of NuvaRing. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.10 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of NuvaRing into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in NuvaRing users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring. 5.11 CHC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue NuvaRing if pregnancy is confirmed. 5.12 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue NuvaRing use if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.13 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Cervix NuvaRing is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that CHCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.14 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.15 Monitoring A woman who is using NuvaRing should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.16 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.17 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using NuvaRing."

        "8. Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with coadministration of other drugs: a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include barbiturates, rifampin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. Since desogestrel is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP 2C9) to form etonogestrel, the active progestin, there is a possibility of interaction with CYP 2C9 substrates or inhibitors (such as ibuprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, phenytoin, fluconazole, diclofenac, tolbutamide, glipizide, celecoxib, sulfamethoxazole, isoniazid, torsemide, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan). The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The efficacy and safety of these oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma hormone levels associated with coadministered drugs: Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain ethinyl estradiol containing oral contraceptives increased AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of coadministered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Velivet."

        "8. Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Daysee was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Daysee. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women) Irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%).

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Daysee if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Daysee at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Daysee no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Daysee if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Daysee for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Daysee. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Daysee if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Daysee if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of Daysee provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop Daysee at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Daysee no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Daysee if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Daysee because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Daysee if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Daysee if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Daysee. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Daysee develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Daysee if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing Daysee, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 1: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Daysee discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (7.1) Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Nikki with other drugs that may increase serum potassium [see WARNING AND PRECAUTION (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) .]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions (> 2%) in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4.0%) and mood changes (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. Toll free at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Nikki in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of Nikki. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of Nikki on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of Nikki, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (> 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Contraception Clinical Trials: Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials: Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Nikki. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular Disorders Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary Disorders Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks : Stop Nikki if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Nikki in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) Liver disease : Discontinue Nikki if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure : Do not prescribe Nikki for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Nikki. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Nikki if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Nikki if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Nikki in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study ( Author , Year of Publication ) Population Studied Comparator Product ( all are low - dose COCs ; with ≤ 0 . 04 mg of EE ) Hazard Ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % CI ) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5 to 1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) Initiators, including new users Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6 to 1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3 to 2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1 to 2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2 to 1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1 Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish reanalysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Nikki at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Nikki no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Nikki if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] 5.2 Hyperkalemia Nikki contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Nikki is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Nikki because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Nikki if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Nikki if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Nikki. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC's. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Nikki develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Nikki if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of Nikki, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Nikki may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ] 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Nikki discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Fig-1 Fig-2"

TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body. Vaginal erosion, vaginal ulceration, adherence of the vaginal ring to the vaginal wall: Cases of ring adherence to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have occurred. Some cases have required surgical removal of vaginal rings. Cases of vaginal erosion and vaginal ulceration that may manifest as vaginal irritation, erythema. abrasion or spotting have occurred. Vaginal wall ulceration or erosion should be carefully evaluated. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete in order to prevent the ring from adhering to the healing tissue. Cases of bowel obstruction and vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated. Cases of hypersensitivity have been reported. The following additional adverse events were reported at least once by patients receiving ESTRING in the worldwide clinical program, which includes controlled and uncontrolled studies. A causal relationship with ESTRING has not been established. Body as a Whole: allergic reaction CNS/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness Gastrointestinal: enlarged abdomen, vomiting Metabolic/Nutritional Disorders: weight decrease or increase Musculoskeletal: arthropathy (including arthrosis) Psychiatric: depression, decreased libido, nervousness Reproductive: breast engorgement, breast enlargement, intermenstrual bleeding, genital edema, vulval disorder Skin/Appendages: pruritus, pruritus ani Urinary: micturition frequency, urethral disorder Vascular: thrombophlebitis Vision: abnormal vision"

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Rifampin: Metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and some progestins (e.g., norethindrone) is increased by rifampin. A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and an increase in menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. Anticonvulsants: Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine have been shown to increase the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and/or some progestins, which could result in a reduction of contraceptive effectiveness. Antibiotics: Pregnancy while taking combined hormonal contraceptives has been reported when the combined hormonal contraceptives were administered with antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, and griseofulvin. However, clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not demonstrated any consistent effects of antibiotics (other than rifampin) on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Atorvastatin: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively. St. John’s Wort: Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and emergency contraceptive pills. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Other: Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma concentrations of some synthetic estrogens, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and an increased incidence of menstrual irregularities has been suggested with phenylbutazone. Effects of Drospirenone on Other Drugs Metabolic Interactions Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies (see Metabolism). In in vitro studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose). Based on the available results of in vivo and in vitro studies it can be concluded that, at clinical dose level, DRSP shows little propensity to interact to a significant extent with cytochrome P450 enzymes. Interactions with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol with other drugs (see BOLDED WARNING ). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol clinical trials. A drug-drug interaction study of DRSP 3 mg/estradiol (E2) 1 mg versus placebo was performed in 24 mildly hypertensive postmenopausal women taking enalapril maleate 10 mg twice daily. Potassium levels were obtained every other day for a total of 2 weeks in all subjects. Mean serum potassium levels in the DRSP/E2 treatment group relative to baseline were 0.22 mEq/L higher than those in the placebo group. Serum potassium concentrations also were measured at multiple timepoints over 24 hours at baseline and on Day 14. On Day 14, the ratios for serum potassium Cmax and AUC in the DRSP/E2 group to those in the placebo group were 0.955 (90% CI: 0.914, 0.999) and 1.010 (90% CI: 0.944, 1.080), respectively. No patient in either treatment group developed hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L). Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs Combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. In addition, oral contraceptives may induce the conjugation of other compounds. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance on temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives."

        "8. DRUG INTERACTIONS Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other drugs: a. Anti-infective agents and anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include barbiturates, rifampin, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. Since desogestrel is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP 2C9) to form etonogestrel, the active progestin, there is a possibility of interaction with CYP 2C9 substrates or inhibitors (such as: ibuprofen, piroxicam, naproxen, phenytoin, fluconazole, diclofenac, tolbutamide, glipizide, celecoxib, sulfamethoxazole, isoniazid, torsemide, irbesartan, losartan, and valsartan). The clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown. b. Anti-HIV protease inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The efficacy and safety of these oral contraceptive products may be affected with co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal products Herbal products containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma hormone levels associated with co-administered drugs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain ethinyl estradiol containing oral contraceptives increased AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with CYCLESSA®."

A reduction in contraceptive effectiveness and an increase in menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin. Minocycline: Minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progesterone, FSH and LH plasma levels, breakthrough bleeding, or contraceptive failure cannot be ruled out. Anticonvulsants: Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine have been shown to increase the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and/or some progestins, which could result in a reduction of contraceptive effectiveness. Antibiotics: Pregnancy while taking combined hormonal contraceptives has been reported when the combined hormonal contraceptives were administered with antimicrobials such as ampicillin, tetracycline, and griseofulvin.

Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 in vivo. Two additional clinical drug-drug interaction studies using simvastatin and midazolam as marker substrates for CYP3A4 were each performed in 24 healthy postmenopausal women. The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. Interactions with Drugs that Have the Potential to Increase Serum Potassium There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium in women taking Gianvi with other drugs (see BOLDED WARNING). Of note, occasional or chronic use of NSAID medication was not restricted in any of the clinical trials with Gianvi.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding.Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Linyah. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs ● COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. ● COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: ● Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ● Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] ● Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: ● Irregular uterine bleeding ● Nausea ● Breast tenderness ● Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tri-cycle norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of tri-cycle norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets for contraception. Two trials were randomized activecontrolled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. ● Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Linyah if indicated. ● Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems ● Stop Tri-Linyah if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. ● Stop Tri-Linyah if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. ● If feasible, stop Tri-Linyah at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. ● Start Tri-Linyah no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. ● The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. ● Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. ● Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Linyah in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Linyah if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Linyah is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Tri-Linyah is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Linyah if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Linyah. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Tri-Linyah develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Linyah if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Linyah in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tricycle tablets, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles). A total of 231 (4.8%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tricycle tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 13-38% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tricycle tablets experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Linyah may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Linyah use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Linyah if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix ● Tri-Linyah is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. ● Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Linyah."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (7.1) Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Nikki with other drugs that may increase serum potassium [see WARNING AND PRECAUTION (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) .]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions (> 2%) in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4.0%) and mood changes (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. Toll free at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Nikki in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of Nikki. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of Nikki on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of Nikki, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (> 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Contraception Clinical Trials: Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1.0%). Acne Clinical Trials: Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Nikki. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular Disorders Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary Disorders Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks : Stop Nikki if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Nikki in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) Liver disease : Discontinue Nikki if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure : Do not prescribe Nikki for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Nikki. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Nikki if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Nikki if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Nikki in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study ( Author , Year of Publication ) Population Studied Comparator Product ( all are low - dose COCs ; with ≤ 0 . 04 mg of EE ) Hazard Ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % CI ) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5 to 1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) Initiators, including new users Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6 to 1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3 to 2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1 to 2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2 to 1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1 Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish reanalysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Nikki at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Nikki no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Nikki if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] 5.2 Hyperkalemia Nikki contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Nikki is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Nikki because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Nikki if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Nikki if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Nikki. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC's. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Nikki develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Nikki if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of Nikki, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use Nikki may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ] 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Nikki discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Fig-1 Fig-2"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Yasmin with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 -35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of Yasmin vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17-40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Yasmin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Yasmin if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1). COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Yasmin in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE (5.1). • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Yasmin for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Yasmin. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Yasmin if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on Yasmin, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Yasmin in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users \"New users\" - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study\" (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Yasmin at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Yasmin no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Yasmin if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] fig 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Yasmin contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Yasmin is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Yasmin because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Yasmin if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Yasmin. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Yasmin develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the Yasmin trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use Yasmin may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yasmin discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.

Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds.

A phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Layolis Fe for pregnancy prevention. The study was a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study with a treatment duration of 12 months (thirteen 28-day cycles). A total of 1,677 women aged 18-46 were enrolled and took at least one dose of Layolis Fe. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 8.5% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.0%), weight increase (0.8%), acne (0.8%), metrorrhagia (0.7%), altered mood (0.4%), hypertension (0.4%), irritability (0.3%), migraine (0.3%), decreased libido (0.3%) and mood swings (0.3%). Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of all treated subjects): nausea/vomiting (8.8%), headaches/migraine (7.5%), depression/mood complaints (4.1%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), acne (3.2%), anxiety symptoms (2.4%), breast pain/tenderness (2.4%), and increased weight (2.3%).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Layolis Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Layolis Fe. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Layolis Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Layolis Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Layolis Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Layolis Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Layolis Fe because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Layolis Fe if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Layolis Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease may be increased among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Layolis Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Layolis Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Layolis Fe if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Patient diaries from the clinical trial of Layolis Fe showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking Layolis Fe had unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. From Cycle 2-13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21-31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6 – 4.2 in cycles 2-13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation. Women who are not pregnant and use Layolis Fe may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2-13 was 3.7 days. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Layolis Fe use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.10 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Layolis Fe discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Lo Loestrin Fe. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Ethinyl Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 percent. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (for example, ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2 percent) are nausea/vomiting (7 percent), headache (7 percent), bleeding irregularities (5 percent), dysmenorrhea (4 percent), weight change (4 percent), breast tenderness (4 percent), acne (3 percent), abdominal pain (3 percent), anxiety (2 percent) and depression (2 percent) (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Warner Chilcott at 1-800-521-8813 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Lo Loestrin Fe for pregnancy prevention. The study was a one year, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled study. A total of 1,660 women aged 18 to 45 were enrolled and took at least one dose of Lo Loestrin Fe [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2 percent of all Treated Subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2 percent of the 1,660 women using Lo Loestrin Fe were the following in order of decreasing incidence: nausea/vomiting (7 percent), headache (7 percent), bleeding irregularities (including metrorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage and dysfunctional uterine bleeding) (5 percent), dysmenorrhea (4 percent), weight fluctuation (4 percent), breast tenderness (4 percent), acne (3 percent), abdominal pain (3 percent), anxiety (2 percent), and depression (2 percent). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 10.7 percent of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥1 percent of subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were in decreasing order: menstrual irregularities (including metrorrhagia, irregular menstruation, menorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (4 percent), headache/migraine (1 percent), mood disorder (including mood swings, depression, anxiety) (1 percent), and weight fluctuation (1 percent). Serious Adverse Reactions: deep vein thrombosis, ovarian vein thrombosis, cholecystitis."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop Lo Loestrin Fe if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Lo Loestrin Fe at least 4 weeks before through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Lo Loestrin Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue Lo Loestrin Fe if jaundice occurs (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Lo Loestrin Fe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Lo Loestrin Fe. Consider an alternative contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Lo Loestrin Fe if indicated (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop Lo Loestrin Fe if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop Lo Loestrin Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Lo Loestrin Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest in older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Lo Loestrin Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Lo Loestrin Fe because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue Lo Loestrin Fe if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Lo Loestrin Fe if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Lo Loestrin Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Lo Loestrin Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Lo Loestrin Fe if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lo Loestrin Fe also assessed unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,582 who had at least one post-treatment evaluation) completed over 15,000 cycles of exposure. A total of 1,257 women (85.9 percent) experienced unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting at some time during Cycles 2 to 13 of this study. The incidence of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was highest during Cycle 2 (53 percent) and lowest at Cycle 13 (36 percent). Among these women, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting during a 28-day cycle ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 days. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over the one year study, with an average of less than 2 days per cycle. Women who are not pregnant and use Lo Loestrin Fe may experience amenorrhea (absence of scheduled and unscheduled bleeding/spotting). In the clinical trial with Lo Loestrin Fe, the incidence of amenorrhea increased from 32 percent in Cycle 1 to 49 percent by Cycle 13. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent. 5.9 COC Use before or during Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Lo Loestrin Fe use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Lo Loestrin Fe discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration : There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache •The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in contraception and acne clinical trials were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4 %) and mood changes (2.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Contraception and Acne Clinical Trials The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=1,056) and for moderate acne vulgaris (N=536). For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. The adverse reactions seen across the 2 indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%) and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood and affect lability) (2.2%). Adverse Reactions (≥1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Contraception Clinical Trials Of 1,056 women, 6.6% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.6%) and nausea/vomiting (1%). Acne Clinical Trials Of 536 women, 5.4% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was menstrual irregularities (including menometrorrhagia, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and vaginal hemorrhage) (2.2%) . Serious Adverse Reactions Contraception Clinical Trials: migraine and cervical dysplasia Acne Clinical Trials: none reported in the clinical trials 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are grouped into System Organ Classes, and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, retinal thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease, liver function disturbances, liver tumors Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia, hypertriglyceridemia, changes in glucose tolerance or effect on peripheral insulin resistance (including diabetes mellitus) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma, angioedema, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal disorders: Inflammatory bowel disease Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Vascular risks: Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Loryna™ in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) •Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.3) •Liver disease: Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) •High blood pressure: Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) •Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) •Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated. (5.8) •Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the studyIncludes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCS available in Europe during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE Other COCs available during the course of the study Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See ADVERSE REACTIONS (6).] Figure 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP which has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDS. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose intolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COC’s. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs. [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild antimineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable). 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampicin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Ethinyl Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable). Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. If feasible, stop norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (greater than 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Patient diaries from the clinical trial of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) showed that on the first cycle of use, 37% of subjects taking norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) had unscheduled bleeding and/ or spotting. From Cycle 2 to 13, the percent of women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting ranged from 21% to 31% per cycle. For those women with unscheduled bleeding/spotting, the mean number of days of unscheduled bleeding/spotting was 5.2 in the first cycle of use and ranged from 3.6 to 4.2 in Cycles 2 to 13. A total of 15 subjects out of 1,677 (0.9%) discontinued the study prematurely due to metrorrhagia or irregular menstruation. Women who are not pregnant and use norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (chewable) and ferrous fumarate tablets (chewable) may not have scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding every cycle or may experience amenorrhea (absence of any bleeding and spotting). The incidence of amenorrhea in the clinical trial increased from 8.1% of the subjects in Cycle 2 to 18.4% by Cycle 13. For those women who had scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, the average duration of bleeding per cycle in Cycles 2 to 13 was 3.7 days. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year.) If feasible, stop COCs at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start COCs no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Stop COCs if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use COCs because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue COCs if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop COCs if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2-3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled Bleeding Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 0 5 11 7.5 2.5 4th 0 0 5 3.5 1.2 Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 3 10 19 14.0 4.7 4th 0 3 10 6.5 2.2 Figure 1 shows the percentage of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects participating in the primary clinical trial with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or just unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting (Based on Daily Diaries) Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. fig 1"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLGY ( 12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) AND DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)]."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING AND WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] •Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Syeda™ in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue SyedaTM if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe SyedaTM for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking SyedaTM. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue SyedaTM if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users* All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study † HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users* All COC’s available in Europe during the conduct of the study‡ Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6 -1.4) HR: 1 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New users* All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study§ Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE Other COCs available during the course of the study§ Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) HR: (1.7) (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) *“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months †Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate ‡Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone §Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs ‡LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] Figure 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

(7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, topiramate and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes: In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration: There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking Yasmin with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache /migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%), abdominal pain/tenderness/discomfort (2.3%), mood changes (2.3%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Yasmin (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 -35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of Yasmin vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17-40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation: Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Yasmin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency. Vascular disorders: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, sagittal sinus thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, myocardial infarction and stroke), hypertension Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder disease Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Hyperkalemia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Chloasma"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Yasmin if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding (5.1). COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating Yasmin in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE (5.1). • Hyperkalemia: DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) • Liver disease: Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice occurs. (5.4) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Yasmin for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Yasmin. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. (5.8) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Yasmin if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on Yasmin, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of Yasmin in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Yasmin Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied Comparator Product (all are low-dose COCs; with ≤ 0.04 mg of EE) Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new users \"New users\" - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new users All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) FDA-funded study” (2011) New users Other COCs available during the course of the study Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the study HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these “regulatory studies,” other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Yasmin Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. *Comparator “Other COCs”, including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study #Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]1, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]2, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]3, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]4, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]5, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]6, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]7, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]8, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]9) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop Yasmin at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start Yasmin no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop Yasmin if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ).] fig 1 Figure 2 5.2 Hyperkalemia Yasmin contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Yasmin is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Yasmin because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Yasmin if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Yasmin. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking Yasmin develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Yasmin if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the Yasmin trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use Yasmin may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yasmin discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Sprintec. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

The safety of Sprintec was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Sprintec for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Sprintec at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Sprintec no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Sprintec in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Sprintec if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Sprintec is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Sprintec is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Sprintec. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Sprintec develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Sprintec if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Sprintec in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of Sprintec, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles). A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued Sprintec, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14 to 34% of women using Sprintec experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Sprintec may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Sprintec use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Sprintec if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix •Sprintec is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. •Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Sprintec."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Sprintec. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs •COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge), vaginal infection, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression), genital discharge, changes in weight (including weight increased or decreased). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Sprintec was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Tri-Sprintec for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials. In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush; Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

Concomitant administration of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole), verapamil, macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin), diltiazem, and grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentrations of the estrogen or the progestin or both. In a clinical drug-drug interaction study conducted in premenopausal women, once daily co-administration of DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02 mg containing tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 10 days resulted in a moderate increase of DRSP systemic exposure. The exposure of EE was increased mildly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations. COCs Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of CYP450 Enzymes In clinical studies, administration of a hormonal contraceptive containing EE did not lead to any increase or only to a weak increase in plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam) while plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., omeprazole and voriconazole) and CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline and tizanidine) can have a weak or moderate increase. Clinical studies did not indicate an inhibitory potential of DRSP towards human CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. Potential to Increase Serum Potassium Concentration There is a potential for an increase in serum potassium concentration in women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets with other drugs that may increase serum potassium concentration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]."

The data provided reflect the experience with the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets (3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE) in the adequate and well-controlled studies for contraception (N=2,837). The US pivotal clinical study (N=326) was a multicenter, open-label trial in healthy women aged 18 to 35 who were treated for up to 13 cycles. The second pivotal study (N=442)was a multicenter, randomized, open-label comparative European study of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets vs. 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.03 mg EE conducted in healthy women aged 17 to 40 who were treated for up to 26 cycles. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were: premenstrual syndrome (13.2%), headache/migraine (10.7%), breast pain/tenderness/discomfort (8.3%), nausea/vomiting (4.5%) abdominal pain/discomfort/tenderness (2.3%) and mood changes (depression, depressed mood, irritability, mood swings, mood altered and affect lability (2.3%). Adverse Reactions (≥ 1%) Leading to Study Discontinuation Of 2,837 women, 6.7% discontinued from the clinical trials due to an adverse reaction; the most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was headache/migraine (1.5%). Serious Adverse Reactions Depression, pulmonary embolism, toxic skin eruption, and uterine leiomyoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions, including fatalities, are grouped into System Organ Classes and ordered by frequency.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks : Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) COCs containing DRSP may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Before initiating drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. (5.1) Hyperkalemia : DRSP has anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Do not use in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia. Check serum potassium concentration during the first treatment cycle in women on long-term treatment with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration. (5.2, 7.1, 7.2) Liver disease : Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.4) High blood pressure : Do not prescribe drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.5) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.7) Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.8) Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.9) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Based on presently available information on drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Compared to Users of Oral Contraceptives that Contain Other Progestins a)“New users” - no use of combination hormonal contraception for at least the prior 6 months b) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, norgestrel, medroxyprogesterone, or ethynodiol diacetate c) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, chlormadinone acetate, gestodene, cyproterone acetate, norgestimate, or norethindrone d) Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel Epidemiologic Study ( Author , Year of Publication ) Population Studied Comparator Product ( all are low - dose COCs ; with ≤ 0 . 04 mg of EE ) Hazard Ratio ( HR ) ( 95 % CI ) i3 Ingenix (Seeger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in the US during the conduct of the study b HR: 0.9 (0.5-1.6) EURAS (Dinger 2007) Initiators, including new usersa All COCs available in Europe during the conduct of the studyc Levonorgestrel/EE HR: 0.9 (0.6-1.4) HR: 1.0 (0.6-1.8) “FDA-funded study” (2011) New usersa All users (i.e., initiation and continuing use of study combination hormonal contraception) Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE Other COCs available during the course of the studyd Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg EE HR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4) HR: 1.6 (1.1-2.2) HR: 1.7 (1.4-2.1) HR: 1.5 (1.2-1.8) In addition to these \"regulatory studies,\" other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 1): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 1), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1: VTE Risk with Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Relative to LNG-Containing COCs (adjusted risk#) Risk ratios displayed on logarithmic scale; risk ratio < 1 indicates a lower risk of VTE for DRSP, > 1 indicates an increased risk of VTE for DRSP. * Comparator \"Other COCs\", including LNG- containing COCs † LASS is an extension of the EURAS study # Some adjustment factors are indicated by superscript letters: a) Current heavy smoking, b) hypertension, c) obesity, d) family history, e) age, f) BMI, g) duration of use, h) VTE history, i) period of inclusion, j) calendar year, k) education, l) length of use, m) parity, n) chronic disease, o) concomitant medication, p) smoking, q) duration of exposure, r) site (References: Ingenix [Seeger 2007]2, EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]3, LASS (Long-Term Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger, unpublished document on file], FDA-funded study [Sidney 2011]4, Danish [Lidegaard 2009]5, Danish re-analysis [ Lidegaard 2011]6, MEGA study [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009]7, German Case-Control study [Dinger 2010]8, PharMetrics [Jick 2011]9, GPRD study [Parkin 2011]10) Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE If feasible, stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] 5.2 Hyperkalemia Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contain 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablet is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] 5.3 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer is a hormonally sensitive tumor. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.4 Liver Disease Discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.5 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.6 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.7 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.8 Headache If a woman taking drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.9 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.10 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect when COCs are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy and [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]. 5.11 Depression Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) ]. DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Figure 1 Figure 2"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John's wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

Start levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

(5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (greater than 35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COC also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (greater than 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had less than or equal to this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had less than or equal to this number of days of unscheduled bleeding 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 10 6.9 1.7 4th 0 1 4 3.2 0.8 Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had less than or equal to this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had less than or equal to this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had less than or equal to this number of days of unscheduled spotting. 91 - Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84 - Day Interval Days per 28 - Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 11 7.4 1.9 4th 0 2 7 4.4 1.1 Figure 1 shows the percentage of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with greater than or equal to 7 days or greater than or equal to 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs. Graph"

In the two pivotal controlled studies, discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event was required by 5.4 percent of patients receiving ESTRING and 3.9 percent of patients receiving conjugated estrogens vaginal cream. The most common reasons for withdrawal from ESTRING treatment due to an adverse event were vaginal discomfort and gastrointestinal symptoms. The adverse events reported with a frequency of 3 percent or greater in the two pivotal controlled studies by patients receiving ESTRING or conjugated estrogens vaginal cream are listed in Table 4.

Post-Marketing Experience A few cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body. A few cases of ring adherence to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have been reported. Vaginal wall ulceration or erosion should be carefully evaluated. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete in order to prevent the ring from adhering to the healing tissue. A few cases of bowel obstruction and vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated. The following additional adverse events were reported at least once by patients receiving ESTRING in the worldwide clinical program, which includes controlled and uncontrolled studies. A causal relationship with ESTRING has not been established. Body as a Whole: allergic reaction CNS/Peripheral Nervous System: dizziness Gastrointestinal: enlarged abdomen, vomiting Metabolic/Nutritional Disorders: weight decrease or increase Musculoskeletal: arthropathy (including arthrosis) Psychiatric: depression, decreased libido, nervousness Reproductive: breast engorgement, breast enlargement, intermenstrual bleeding, genital edema, vulval disorder Skin/Appendages: pruritus, pruritus ani Urinary: micturition frequency, urethral disorder Vascular: thrombophlebitis Vision: abnormal vision The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with estrogens: Genitourinary system: abnormal uterine bleeding/spotting; dysmenorrheal/pelvic pain; increase in size of uterine leiomyomata; vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis; change in amount of cervical secretion; changes in cervical ectropion; ovarian cancer; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial cancer Breasts: tenderness, enlargement, pain, nipple discharge, galactorrhea; fibrocystic breast changes; breast cancer Cardiovascular: deep and superficial venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; thrombophlebitis; myocardial infarction; stroke; increase in blood pressure Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting; abdominal cramps, bloating; cholestatic jaundice; increased incidence of gallbladder disease; pancreatitis, enlargement of hepatic hemangiomas Skin: chloasma or melasma that may persist when drug is discontinued; erythema multiforme; erythema nodosum; hemorrhagic eruption; loss of scalp hair; hirsutism, rash Eyes: retinal vascular thrombosis; intolerance to contact lenses Central Nervous System: headache; migraine; dizziness; mental depression; exacerbation of chorea; nervousness; mood disturbances; irritability; exacerbation of epilepsy, dementia Miscellaneous: increase or decrease in weight; glucose intolerance; aggravation of porphyria; edema; arthralgias; leg cramps; changes in libido; angioedema; anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions; hypocalcemia (preexisting condition); exacerbation of asthma; increased triglycerides"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri-Lo-Marzia. 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Vascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Tri-Lo-Marzia was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects) The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions Carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps) Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety, insomnia Nervous System Disorders Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness Eye Disorders Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Vertigo Cardiac Disorders Tachycardia, palpitations Vascular Events Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush Arterial Events Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver Disease: Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High Blood Pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri-Lo-Marzia. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. If feasible, stop Tri-Lo-Marzia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start Tri-Lo-Marzia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri-Lo-Marzia in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Lo-Marzia if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Lo-Marzia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking Tri-Lo-Marzia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Tri-Lo-Marzia in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued Tri-Lo-Marzia, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using Tri-Lo-Marzia experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri-Lo-Marzia may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix Tri-Lo-Marzia is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Lo-Marzia."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with TriNessa Lo. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol (EE). The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, breast issues, abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, mood disorders, acne, vulvovaginal infection, abdominal distension, weight increased, fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of TriNessa Lo was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of TriNessa Lo for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18–45 (nonsmoker if 35–45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.1%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: In the clinical trial of TriNessa Lo 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%). Serious Adverse Reactions: carcinoma of the cervix in situ (1 subject) and cervical dysplasia (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop TriNessa Lo if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue TriNessa Lo if jaundice occurs. (5.2) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop TriNessa Lo if blood pressure rises significantly. (5.3) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking TriNessa Lo. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.5) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue TriNessa Lo if indicated. (5.6) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.7) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop TriNessa Lo if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs. Stop TriNessa Lo if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If feasible, stop TriNessa Lo at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start TriNessa Lo no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use TriNessa Lo in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue TriNessa Lo if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors TriNessa Lo is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood Pressure TriNessa Lo is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop TriNessa Lo if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take TriNessa Lo. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 Headache If a woman taking TriNessa Lo develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue TriNessa Lo if indicated. Consider discontinuation of TriNessa Lo in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In the clinical trial of TriNessa Lo, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued TriNessa Lo, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7–17% of women using TriNessa Lo experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use TriNessa Lo may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue TriNessa Lo use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue TriNessa Lo if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix TriNessa Lo is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking TriNessa Lo."

The data described below reflect exposure to norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in 3330 sexually active women (3322 of whom had safety data) who participated in three Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate contraceptive efficacy and safety. These subjects received six or 13 cycles of contraception (norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or an oral contraceptive comparator in two of the trials). The women ranged in age from 18 to 45 years and were predominantly white (91%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported during clinical trials were breast symptoms, nausea/vomiting, headache, application site disorder, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, and mood, affect and anxiety disorders. The most common events leading to discontinuation were application site reaction, breast symptoms (including breast discomfort, engorgement and pain), nausea and/or vomiting, headache and emotional lability. Adverse drug reactions reported by ≥ 2.5% of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system-treated subjects in these trials are shown in Table 3.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vascular risks: Stop Xulane if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) • Liver disease: Discontinue Xulane if jaundice occurs. (5.3) • High blood pressure: Do not prescribe Xulane for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Xulane. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) • Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Xulane if indicated. (5.7) • Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Xulane if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop Xulane if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop Xulane at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Discontinue use of Xulane during prolonged immobilization and resume treatment based on clinical judgment. Start Xulane no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)]. Five epidemiologic studies1- 9 that assessed the risk of VTE associated with use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system are described below. These are four case control studies, that compared VTE rates among women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system to rates among women using an OC comparator, and an FDA-funded cohort study that estimated and compared VTE rates among women using various hormonal contraceptives, including norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. All five studies were retrospective studies from U.S. electronic healthcare databases and included women aged 15 to 44 (10 to 55 in the FDA-funded study) who used norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or oral contraceptives containing 20 mcg to 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone, or norgestimate (NGM). NGM is the prodrug for NGMN, the progestin in Xulane. Some of the data from the epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of VTE with use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared to use of some combined oral contraceptives (see Table 1). The studies used slightly different designs and reported relative risk estimates ranging from 1.2 to 2.2. None of the studies have adjusted for body mass index, smoking, and family history of VTE, which are potential confounders. The interpretations of these relative risk estimates range from no increase in risk to an approximate doubling of risk. One of the studies found a statistically significant increased risk of VTE for current users of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. The five studies are: •The i3 Ingenix study with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, including a 24-month extension, based on the Ingenix Research Datamart; this study included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. •The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program (BCDSP) with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator (BCDSP NGM), including two extensions of 17 and 14 months, respectively, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. •BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. •BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Marketscan database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. •FDA-funded study with two groups of comparators [1) LNG-containing oral contraceptives, and 2) oral contraceptives that contain LNG, norethindrone or norgestimate], based on Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases. This study used all cases of VTE (idiopathic and non-idiopathic) and included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. The i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies have provided data on additional cases identified in study extensions; however, each study extension was not powered to provide independent estimates of risk. The pooled estimates provide the most reliable estimates of VTE risk. Risk ratios from the original and various extensions of the i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies are provided in Table 1. The results of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Table 1: Estimates (Risk Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of Norelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System Compared to Combined Oral Contraceptive Users Epidemiologic Study “New users” – i.e., women with no prior exposure to the drug studied during a pre-specified time period – are considered to be the most informative population to study in pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies. All estimates took account of new-user status. The method and time period used to identify “new users” varied from study to study. Comparator Product Risk Ratios (95% CI) i3 Ingenix NGM Study in Ingenix Research Datamart1,6,7,8 NGM/35 mcg EENGM = norgestimate; EE = ethinyl estradiol 2.2 Increase in risk of VTE is statistically significant (1.2 – 4.0) Pooled risk ratio from references 1 and 6 covering the initial 33-month study plus 24-month extension.

These risk ratios are based on idiopathic cases (those in women without other known risk factors for VTE). If all VTE cases are considered, the pooled risk ratio and 95% CI are 2.0 (1.2-3.3)C.

Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 2). The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of CHCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as, cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. In general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. Use CHCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Figure 1: VTE Risk of Norelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol Transdermal System Relative to Combined Oral Contraceptives Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE 5.2 PK Profile of Ethinyl Estradiol The PK profile for the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is different from the PK profile for oral contraceptives in that it has a higher Css and a lower Cmax. AUC and average Css for EE are approximately 60% higher in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using an oral contraceptive containing EE 35 mcg. In contrast, the Cmax for EE is approximately 25% lower in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Inter-subject variability results in increased exposure to EE in some women using either norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system or oral contraceptives. However, inter-subject variability in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is higher. It is not known whether there are changes in the risk of serious adverse events based on the differences in PK profiles of EE in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared with women using oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg to 35 mcg of EE. Increased estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse events, including venous thromboembolism. [See Boxed Warning and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 5.3 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Xulane in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue Xulane if jaundice develops. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded. Liver Tumors Xulane is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users. 5.4 High Blood Pressure Xulane is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Xulane if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking hormonal contraceptives, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Xulane. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. In a 6-cycle clinical trial with norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system there were no clinically significant changes in fasting blood glucose from baseline to end of treatment. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on hormonal contraceptives. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using hormonal contraceptives. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Xulane develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Xulane if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Xulane in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during hormonal contraceptive use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding. In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle. Table 2: Unscheduled (Breakthrough) Bleeding/Spotting (Subjects Evaluable for Efficacy) Treatment Cycle Pooled data from 3 studies N = 3319 n %Percentage of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting events. Cycle 1 2994 18.2 Cycle 2 2743 11.9 Cycle 3 2699 11.6 Cycle 4 2541 10.1 Cycle 5 2532 9.2 Cycle 6 2494 8.3 Cycle 7 698 8.3 Cycle 8 692 8.7 Cycle 9 654 8.6 Cycle 10 621 8.7 Cycle 11 631 8.9 Cycle 12 617 6.3 Cycle 13 611 8.0 Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Hormonal Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Xulane use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of CHCs should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Xulane if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Carcinoma of Breasts and Cervix Xulane is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that combination oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using Xulane."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs. (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of CHCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of CHCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain CHCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20–25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritnoavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs CHCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, and temazepam. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of CHCs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. 7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of combination hormonal contraceptives, including ORTHO EVRA, are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Vascular events, including venous and arterial thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Adverse reactions commonly reported by users of combination hormonal contraceptives are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥ 5%) were breast symptoms, nausea/vomiting, headache, application site disorder, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, and mood, affect and anxiety disorders. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to ORTHO EVRA in 3330 sexually active women (3322 of whom had safety data) who participated in three Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate contraceptive efficacy and safety. These subjects received six or 13 cycles of contraception (ORTHO EVRA or an oral contraceptive comparator in 2 of the trials). The women ranged in age from 18 to 45 years and were predominantly white (91%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported during clinical trials were breast symptoms, nausea/vomiting, headache, application site disorder, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, and mood, affect and anxiety disorders. The most common events leading to discontinuation were application site reaction, breast symptoms (including breast discomfort, engorgement and pain), nausea and/or vomiting, headache and emotional lability. Adverse drug reactions reported by ≥ 2.5% of ORTHO EVRA-treated subjects in these trials are shown in Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop ORTHO EVRA if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue ORTHO EVRA if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe ORTHO EVRA for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking ORTHO EVRA. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue ORTHO EVRA if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop ORTHO EVRA if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs. Stop ORTHO EVRA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. If feasible, stop ORTHO EVRA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE. Discontinue use of ORTHO EVRA during prolonged immobilization and resume treatment based on clinical judgment. Start ORTHO EVRA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)]. Five epidemiologic studies1–9 that assessed the risk of VTE associated with use of ORTHO EVRA are described below. These are 4 case control studies, that compared VTE rates among women using ORTHO EVRA to rates among women using an OC comparator, and an FDA-funded cohort study that estimated and compared VTE rates among women using various hormonal contraceptives, including ORTHO EVRA. All five studies were retrospective studies from U.S. electronic healthcare databases and included women aged 15–44 (10–55 in the FDA-funded study) who used ORTHO EVRA or oral contraceptives containing 20–35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone, or norgestimate (NGM). NGM is the prodrug for NGMN, the progestin in ORTHO EVRA. Some of the data from the epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of VTE with use of ORTHO EVRA compared to use of some combined oral contraceptives (see Table 1). The studies used slightly different designs and reported relative risk estimates ranging from 1.2 to 2.2. None of the studies have adjusted for body mass index, smoking, and family history of VTE, which are potential confounders. The interpretations of these relative risk estimates range from no increase in risk to an approximate doubling of risk. One of the studies found a statistically significant increased risk of VTE for current users of ORTHO EVRA. The five studies are: The i3 Ingenix study with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, including a 24-month extension, based on the Ingenix Research Datamart; this study included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program (BCDSP) with NGM-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator (BCDSP NGM), including two extensions of 17 and 14 months, respectively, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Pharmetrics database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. BCDSP with LNG-containing oral contraceptives as the comparator, based on the Marketscan database, using only non-fatal idiopathic cases. VTE cases were not confirmed by chart review. FDA-funded study with two groups of comparators [1) LNG-containing oral contraceptives, and 2) oral contraceptives that contain LNG, norethindrone or norgestimate], based on Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases. This study used all cases of VTE (idiopathic and non-idiopathic) and included patient chart review to confirm the VTE occurrence. The i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies have provided data on additional cases identified in study extensions; however, each study extension was not powered to provide independent estimates of risk. The pooled estimates provide the most reliable estimates of VTE risk. Risk ratios from the original and various extensions of the i3 Ingenix and BCDSP NGM studies are provided in Table 1. The results of these studies are presented in Figure 1. Table 1: Estimates (Risk Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Current Users of ORTHO EVRA Compared to Combined Oral Contraceptive Users Epidemiologic Study\"New users\" – i.e., women with no prior exposure to the drug studied during a pre-specified time period – are considered to be the most informative population to study in pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies. All estimates took account of new-user status. The method and time period used to identify \"new users\" varied from study to study. Comparator Product Risk Ratios (95% CI) i3 Ingenix NGM Study in Ingenix Research Datamart1,6,7,8 NGM/35 mcg EENGM = norgestimate; EE = ethinyl estradiol 2.2 Increase in risk of VTE is statistically significant (1.2–4.0)Pooled risk ratio from references 1 and 6 covering the initial 33-month study plus 24-month extension.

These risk ratios are based on idiopathic cases (those in women without other known risk factors for VTE). If all VTE cases are considered, the pooled risk ratio and 95% CI are 2.0 (1.2–3.3)C.

The method and time period used to identify \"new users\" varied from study to study. b Includes the following progestins: levonorgestrel (LNG), norethindrone, norgestimate (NGM). BCDSP = Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program EE = ethinyl estradiol An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) is well established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of CHCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued. Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the post-partum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. Figure 2: Likelihood of Developing a VTE *CHC = combination hormonal contraception **Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY. Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as, cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes) and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. In general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. Use CHCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Figure 1 Figure 2 5.2 PK Profile of Ethinyl Estradiol The PK profile for the ORTHO EVRA patch is different from the PK profile for oral contraceptives in that it has a higher Css and a lower Cmax. AUC and average Css for EE are approximately 60% higher in women using ORTHO EVRA compared with women using an oral contraceptive containing EE 35 mcg. In contrast, the Cmax for EE is approximately 25% lower in women using ORTHO EVRA. Inter-subject variability results in increased exposure to EE in some women using either ORTHO EVRA or oral contraceptives. However, inter-subject variability in women using ORTHO EVRA is higher. It is not known whether there are changes in the risk of serious adverse events based on the differences in PK profiles of EE in women using ORTHO EVRA compared with women using oral contraceptives containing 30–35 mcg of EE. Increased estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse events, including venous thromboembolism. [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 5.3 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use ORTHO EVRA in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue ORTHO EVRA if jaundice develops. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded. Liver Tumors ORTHO EVRA is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) CHC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users. 5.4 High Blood Pressure ORTHO EVRA is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop ORTHO EVRA if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking hormonal contraceptives, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take ORTHO EVRA. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. In a 6-cycle clinical trial with ORTHO EVRA there were no clinically significant changes in fasting blood glucose from baseline to end of treatment. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on hormonal contraceptives. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using hormonal contraceptives. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking ORTHO EVRA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue ORTHO EVRA if indicated. Consider discontinuation of ORTHO EVRA in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during hormonal contraceptive use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using ORTHO EVRA. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding. In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of ORTHO EVRA in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)] in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued ORTHO EVRA at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Table 2 summarizes the proportion of subjects who experienced unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding/spotting by treatment cycle. Table 2: Unscheduled (Breakthrough) Bleeding/Spotting (Subjects Evaluable for Efficacy) Treatment Cycle Pooled data from 3 studies N=3319 n %Percentage of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting events. Cycle 1 2994 18.2 Cycle 2 2743 11.9 Cycle 3 2699 11.6 Cycle 4 2541 10.1 Cycle 5 2532 9.2 Cycle 6 2494 8.3 Cycle 7 698 8.3 Cycle 8 692 8.7 Cycle 9 654 8.6 Cycle 10 621 8.7 Cycle 11 631 8.9 Cycle 12 617 6.3 Cycle 13 611 8.0 Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea In the event of amenorrhea, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one patch or started the patch on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of hormonal contraceptive use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 Hormonal Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue ORTHO EVRA use if pregnancy is confirmed. Administration of CHCs should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue ORTHO EVRA if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Carcinoma of Breasts and Cervix ORTHO EVRA is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that combination oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.13 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using ORTHO EVRA."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with AMETHIA tablets. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a back-up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs. (7.1) 7.1 Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: barbiturates bosentan carbamazepine felbamate griseofulvin oxcarbazepine phenytoin rifampin St. John’s wort topiramate HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids. Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. 7.2 Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Coadministered Drugs Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. 7.3 Changes in Plasma Levels of Coadministered Drugs COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: Irregular uterine bleeding Nausea Breast tenderness Headache The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in clinical trials for Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets are irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding, weight gain, and acne. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: 16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%). Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 5% of women): irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%). Serious Adverse Reactions: migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reaction Investigations: blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: dizziness, loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders: insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders: dysmenorrhea Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia Vascular disorders: thrombosis"

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop AMETHIA tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop AMETHIA tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start AMETHIA tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue AMETHIA tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe AMETHIA tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (5.4) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking AMETHIA tablets. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. (5.6) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue AMETHIA tablets if indicated. (5.7) Uterine bleeding: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (5.8) Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking AMETHIA Tablets who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding 5.1 Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events Stop AMETHIA tablets if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued. Use of AMETHIA tablets provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year). If feasible, stop AMETHIA tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start AMETHIA tablets no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop AMETHIA tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. 5.2 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use AMETHIA tablets because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive. There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.3 Liver Disease Discontinue AMETHIA tablets if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use. 5.4 High Blood Pressure For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop AMETHIA tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking AMETHIA tablets. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking AMETHIA tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue AMETHIA tablets if indicated. An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. When prescribing AMETHIA tablets, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 1: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Bleeding 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28- Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 10 6.9 1.7 4th 0 1 4 3.2 0.8 Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding Table 2: Total Number of Days with Unscheduled Spotting 91-Day Treatment Cycle Days per 84-Day Interval Days per 28- Day Interval Q1 Median Q3 Mean Mean 1st 1 4 11 7.4 1.9 4th 0 2 7 4.4 1.1 Q1=Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Q3=Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting Figure 1 shows the percentage of Levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle. Figure 1. Percent of Women Taking AMETHIA Tablets who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. 5.9 COC Use Before and During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.10 Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and AMETHIA tablets discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care. 5.13 Other Conditions In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vascular risks: Stop AMETHIA Lo tablets if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start AMETHIA Lo tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (5.1) Liver disease: Discontinue AMETHIA Lo tablets if jaundice occurs. (5.3) High blood pressure: Do not prescribe AMETHIA Lo tablets for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease.

The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking COCs.

A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking COCs develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue COCs if indicated. 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC product. When prescribing AMETHIA Lo tablets, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of AMETHIA Lo tablets also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in this 12-month clinical trial (N=2,185) completed the equivalent of over 20,000 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used OCs previously (89%), as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 209 subjects (9.6%) discontinued AMETHIA Lo tablets, at least in part, due to bleeding and/or spotting. Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 2 to 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Figure 1 5.9 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs. 5.10 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare."

        "8. Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with coadministration of other products a. Anti-Infective Agents and Anticonvulsants Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin. b. Anti-HIV Protease Inhibitors Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of combination oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. c. Herbal Products Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in plasma levels of estradiol associated with coadministered drugs Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain combination oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels. Changes in plasma levels of co-administered drugs Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of combination oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation have been noted when these drugs were administered with combination oral contraceptives."
