        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Clopidogrel: Do not administer during KENGREAL infusion. (7.1) Prasugrel: Do not administer during KENGREAL infusion. (7.1) 7.1 Thienopyridines If clopidogrel or prasugrel are administered during KENGREAL infusion, they will have no antiplatelet effect until the next dose is administered. Clopidogrel and prasugrel, therefore, should not be administered until KENGREAL infusion is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] The most common adverse reaction is bleeding. (5.1, 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact The Medicines Company at 1-888-977-6326 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Figure 1: Bleeding Results in the CHAMPION PHOENIX Studya (All Non-CABG related) 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of KENGREAL has been evaluated in 13,301 subjects in controlled trials, in whom, 5,529 were in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial. Bleeding There was a greater incidence of bleeding with KENGREAL than with clopidogrel. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with KENGREAL (see Table 1 and Figure 1).

The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Drug Discontinuation In CHAMPION PHOENIX the rate of discontinuation for bleeding events was 0.3% for KENGREAL and 0.1% for clopidogrel. Discontinuation for non-bleeding adverse events was low and similar for KENGREAL (0.6%) and for clopidogrel (0.4%). Coronary artery dissection, coronary artery perforation, and dyspnea were the most frequent events leading to discontinuation in patients treated with KENGREAL. Non -Bleeding Adverse Reactions Hypersensitivity Serious cases of hypersensitivity were more frequent with KENGREAL (7/13301) than with control (2/12861). These included anaphylactic reactions, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, angioedema, and stridor. Decreased renal function Worsening renal function was reported in 3.2% of KENGREAL patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) compared to 1.4% of clopidogrel patients with severe renal impairment. Dyspnea Dyspnea was reported more frequently in patients treated with KENGREAL (1.3%) than with control (0.4%)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding: Like other drugs that inhibit platelet P2Y12 function, KENGREAL can increase the risk of bleeding (5.1) 5.1 Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet P2Y12 function, including KENGREAL, increase the risk of bleeding. In CHAMPION PHOENIX bleeding events of all severities were more common with KENGREAL than with clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Bleeding complications with KENGREAL were consistent across a variety of clinically important subgroups (see Figure 1). Once KENGREAL is discontinued, there is no antiplatelet effect after an hour [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."
