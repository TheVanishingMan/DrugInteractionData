        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential for other drugs to affect ivacaftor CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce KALYDECO dose to one tablet or one packet of granules twice a week when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). Reduce KALYDECO dose to one tablet or one packet of granules once daily when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole). Avoid food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges. (7.1, 12.3) 7.1 Inhibitors of CYP3A Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, significantly increased ivacaftor exposure [measured as area under the curve (AUC)] by 8.5-fold. Based on simulations of these results, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose is recommended when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin, as follows: in patients 6 years and older reduce dose to one 150 mg tablet twice a week; in patients 2 to less than 6 years with body weight less than 14 kg, reduce dose to one 50 mg packet of granules twice a week; and in patients 2 to less than 6 years with body weight 14 kg or greater, reduce dose to one 75 mg packet of granules twice a week. Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose is recommended for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and erythromycin, as follows: in patients 6 years and older reduce dose to one 150 mg tablet once daily; in patients 2 to less than 6 years with body weight less than 14 kg, reduce dose to one 50 mg packet of granules once daily; and in patients 2 to less than 6 years with body weight 14 kg or greater, reduce dose to one 75 mg packet of granules once daily. Co-administration of KALYDECO with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, food containing grapefruit or Seville oranges should be avoided during treatment with KALYDECO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Inducers of CYP3A Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 9-fold. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Ciprofloxacin Co-administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin had no effect on the exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Potential for ivacaftor to affect other drugs 7.4 CYP3A and/or P-gp Substrates Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration with midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of KALYDECO may increase systemic exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A and/or P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Therefore, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when co-administering KALYDECO with sensitive CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reaction is discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Transaminase Elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to KALYDECO (occurring in ≥8% of patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene) were headache, oropharyngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, rash, nausea, and dizziness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The overall safety profile of KALYDECO is based on pooled data from three placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted in 353 patients 6 years of age and older with CF who had a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene (Trials 1 and 2) or were homozygous for the F508del mutation (Trial 3). In addition, the following clinical trials have also been conducted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Clinical Studies (14) ]: An 8-week crossover design trial (Trial 4) involving 39 patients between the ages of 6 and 57 years with a G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, G970R, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene. A 24-week placebo-controlled trial (Trial 5) involving 69 patients between the ages of 6 and 68 years with an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene. A 24-week open-label trial (Trial 6) in 34 patients 2 to less than 6 years of age. Patients eligible for Trial 6 were those with the G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, G970R, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R mutation in the CFTR gene. Of 34 patients enrolled, 32 had the G551D mutation and 2 had the S549N mutation. Of the 353 patients included in the pooled analyses of patients with CF who had either a G551D mutation or were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene, 50% of patients were female and 97% were Caucasian; 221 received KALYDECO, and 132 received placebo from 16 to 48 weeks. The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to adverse reactions was 2% for KALYDECO-treated patients and 5% for placebo-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in KALYDECO-treated patients included abdominal pain, increased hepatic enzymes, and hypoglycemia. The most common adverse reactions in the 221 patients treated with KALYDECO were headache (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (16%), nasal congestion (16%), nausea (10%), rash (10%), rhinitis (6%), dizziness (5%), arthralgia (5%), and bacteria in sputum (5%). The incidence of adverse reactions below is based upon two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in a total of 213 patients with CF ages 6 to 53 who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene and who were treated with KALYDECO 150 mg orally or placebo twice daily. Table 2 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥8% of KALYDECO-treated patients with CF who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Table 2: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in ≥8% of KALYDECO-Treated Patients with a G551D Mutation in the CFTR Gene and Greater than Placebo in 2 Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Clinical Trials of 48 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) Incidence: Pooled 48-Week Trials KALYDECO N=109 n (%) Placebo N=104 n (%) Headache 26 (24) 17 (16) Oropharyngeal pain 24 (22) 19 (18) Upper respiratory tract infection 24 (22) 14 (14) Nasal congestion 22 (20) 16 (15) Abdominal pain 17 (16) 13 (13) Nasopharyngitis 16 (15) 12 (12) Diarrhea 14 (13) 10 (10) Rash 14 (13) 7 (7) Nausea 13 (12) 11 (11) Dizziness 10 (9) 1 (1) Adverse reactions in the 48-week clinical trials that occurred in the KALYDECO group at a frequency of 4 to 7% where rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Infections and infestations: rhinitis Investigations: aspartate aminotransferase increased, bacteria in sputum, blood glucose increased, hepatic enzyme increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia Nervous system disorders: sinus headache Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pharyngeal erythema, pleuritic pain, sinus congestion, wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: acne The safety profile for the CF patients enrolled in the other clinical trials (Trials 3-6) was similar to that observed in the 48-week, placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Laboratory Abnormalities Transaminase Elevations: In Trials 1, 2, and 3 the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 × ULN was 2%, 2%, and 6% in KALYDECO-treated patients and 2%, 2%, and 8% in placebo-treated patients, respectively. Two patients (2%) on placebo and 1 patient (0.5%) on KALYDECO permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases, all >8 × ULN. Two patients treated with KALYDECO were reported to have serious adverse reactions of elevated liver transaminases compared to none on placebo. Transaminase elevations were more common in patients with a history of transaminase elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. During the 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 34 patients ages 2 to less than 6 years (Trial 6), where patients received either 50 mg (less than 14 kg) or 75 mg (14 kg or greater) ivacaftor granules twice daily, the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 × ULN was 14.7% (5/34). All 5 patients had maximum ALT or AST levels >8 × ULN, which returned to baseline levels following interruption of KALYDECO dosing. Transaminase elevations were more common in patients who had abnormal transaminases at baseline. KALYDECO was permanently discontinued in one patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elevated transaminases (ALT or AST): Transaminases (ALT and AST) should be assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. In patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing. (5.1, 6) Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) substantially decreases exposure of ivacaftor, which may diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment. (5.3) 5.1 Transaminase (ALT or AST) Elevations Elevated transaminases have been reported in patients with CF receiving KALYDECO. It is recommended that ALT and AST be assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.2 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Use of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, substantially decreases the exposure of ivacaftor, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of KALYDECO. Therefore, co-administration of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and/or exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to KALYDECO cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a complete list. (2.3, 7, 12.3) Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor 7.1 Inhibitors of CYP3A Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact the exposure of lumacaftor, but increased ivacaftor exposure by 4.3-fold. Due to the induction effect of lumacaftor on CYP3A, at steady-state, the net exposure of ivacaftor is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of lumacaftor at a dose of 150 mg every 12 hours (the approved dose of ivacaftor monotherapy). Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary when CYP3A inhibitors are initiated in patients currently taking ORKAMBI. However, when initiating ORKAMBI in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, reduce the ORKAMBI dose to 1 tablet daily (lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg total daily dose) for the first week of treatment to allow for the steady-state induction effect of lumacaftor. Following this period, continue with the recommended daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole telithromycin, clarithromycin. No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitors. 7.2 Inducers of CYP3A Co-administration of lumacaftor/ivacaftor with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal effect on the exposure of lumacaftor, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. This may reduce the effectiveness of ORKAMBI. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is recommended when used with moderate or weak CYP3A inducers. Potential for Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs 7.3 CYP3A Substrates Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Co-administration of lumacaftor with ivacaftor, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, decreased ivacaftor exposure by approximately 80%. Administration of ORKAMBI may decrease systemic exposure of medicinal products which are substrates of CYP3A, thereby decreasing the therapeutic effect of the medicinal product. Co-administration of ORKAMBI is not recommended with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] such as: Benzodiazepines: midazolam, triazolam (consider an alternative to these benzodiazepines). Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus (avoid the use of ORKAMBI). 7.4 CYP2B6 and CYP2C Substrates In vitro studies suggest that lumacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates. 7.5 Digoxin and Other P-gp Substrates Based on in vitro results which showed P-gp inhibition and pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) activation, lumacaftor has the potential to both inhibit and induce P-gp. Additionally, a clinical study with ivacaftor monotherapy showed that ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of ORKAMBI with P-gp substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates. Monitor the serum concentration of digoxin and titrate the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.6 Anti-allergics and Systemic Corticosteroids ORKAMBI may decrease the exposure of montelukast, which may reduce its efficacy. No dose adjustment for montelukast is recommended. Employ appropriate clinical monitoring, as is reasonable, when co-administered with ORKAMBI. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of prednisone and methylprednisolone. A higher dose of these systemic corticosteroids may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.7 Antibiotics Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may decrease the exposure of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and telithromycin, which may reduce the effectiveness of these antibiotics. Consider an alternative to these antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. 7.8 Antifungals Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI with these antifungals is not recommended. Monitor patients closely for breakthrough fungal infections if such drugs are necessary. Consider an alternative such as fluconazole. 7.9 Anti-inflammatories Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of ibuprofen. A higher dose of ibuprofen may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.10 Antidepressants Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline. A higher dose of these antidepressants may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. 7.11 Hormonal Contraceptives ORKAMBI may decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing the effectiveness. Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with ORKAMBI. Concomitant use of ORKAMBI with hormonal contraceptives increased the menstrual abnormality events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. 7.12 Oral Hypoglycemics Concomitant use of ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of repaglinide, and may alter the exposure of sulfonylurea. A dose adjustment may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. No dose adjustment is recommended for metformin. 7.13 Proton Pump Inhibitors, H2 Blockers, Antacids ORKAMBI may reduce the exposure and effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, and lansoprazole, and may alter the exposure of ranitidine. A dose adjustment may be required to obtain the desired clinical effect. No dose adjustment is recommended for calcium carbonate antacid. 7.14 Warfarin ORKAMBI may alter the exposure of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) when warfarin co-administration with ORKAMBI is required. 7.15 Concomitant Drugs that do not Need Dose Adjustment No dosage adjustment of ORKAMBI or concomitant drug is recommended when ORKAMBI is given with the following: azithromycin, aztreonam, budesonide, ceftazidime, cetirizine, ciprofloxacin, colistimethate, colistin, dornase alfa, fluticasone, ipratropium, levofloxacin, pancreatin, pancrelipase, salbutamol, salmeterol, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, tiotropium, and tobramycin. Based on the metabolism and route of elimination, ORKAMBI is not expected to impact the exposure of these drugs."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Use in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver-related Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Respiratory Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Effect on Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] The most common adverse reactions to ORKAMBI (occurring in ≥5% of patients with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene) were dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, respiration abnormal, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, rash, flatulence, rhinorrhea, influenza. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety profile of ORKAMBI is based on the pooled data from 1108 patients with CF 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene and who received at least one dose of study drug in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials, each with 24 weeks of treatment (Trials 1 and 2). Of the 1108 patients, 49% were female and 99% were Caucasian; 369 patients received ORKAMBI every 12 hours and 370 received placebo. The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued study drug due to adverse events was 5% for patients treated with ORKAMBI and 2% for patients who received placebo. Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred more frequently in patients treated with ORKAMBI included pneumonia, hemoptysis, cough, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and transaminase elevations. These occurred in 1% or less of patients. Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients with CF treated with ORKAMBI who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene that also occurred at a higher rate than in patients who received placebo in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in ≥5% of ORKAMBI-Treated Patients Who are Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the CFTR Gene in 2 Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Clinical Trials of 24 Weeks Duration Adverse Reaction (Preferred Term) ORKAMBI N=369 (%) Placebo N=370 (%) Dyspnea 48 (13) 29 (8) Nasopharyngitis 48 (13) 40 (11) Nausea 46 (13) 28 (8) Diarrhea 45 (12) 31 (8) Upper respiratory tract infection 37 (10) 20 (5) Fatigue 34 (9) 29 (8) Respiration abnormal 32 (9) 22 (6) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 27 (7) 20 (5) Rash 25 (7) 7 (2) Flatulence 24 (7) 11 (3) Rhinorrhea 21 (6) 15 (4) Influenza 19 (5) 8 (2) Description of Selected Adverse Drug Reactions Liver-related Adverse Reactions In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) levels >8, >5, and >3 × ULN elevations was similar between patients treated with ORKAMBI and those who received placebo. Three patients who received ORKAMBI had liver-related serious adverse reactions, including 2 reported as transaminase elevations and 1 as hepatic encephalopathy, compared to none in the placebo group. Of these three, one had elevated transaminases (>3 × ULN) associated with bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. Following discontinuation or interruption of ORKAMBI, transaminases decreased to <3 × ULN. Among 6 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension who received ORKAMBI, worsening liver function with increased ALT, AST, bilirubin, and hepatic encephalopathy was observed in one patient. The event occurred within 5 days of the start of dosing and resolved following discontinuation of ORKAMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Respiratory Adverse Reactions In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of respiratory symptom-related adverse reactions (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) was more common in patients treated with ORKAMBI (22%) compared to patients who received placebo (14%). The incidence of these adverse reactions was more common in patients treated with ORKAMBI with lower pre-treatment FEV1. In patients treated with ORKAMBI, the majority of the events began during the first week of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Menstrual Abnormalities In Trials 1 and 2, the incidence of combined menstrual abnormality adverse reactions (e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual irregular) was more common in female patients treated with ORKAMBI (10%) compared to placebo (2%). These events occurred more frequently in the subset of female patients treated with ORKAMBI who were using hormonal contraceptives (27%) compared to those not using hormonal contraceptives (3%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.11)]. Increased Blood Pressure In Trials 1 and 2, adverse reactions related to increases in blood pressure (e.g., hypertension, blood pressure increased) were reported in 1.1% (4/369) of patients treated with ORKAMBI and in no patients who received placebo. The proportion of patients who experienced a systolic blood pressure value >140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 3.6% and 2.2% in patients treated with ORKAMBI, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 0.5% in patients who received placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use in patients with advanced liver disease: ORKAMBI should be used with caution in these patients and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If ORKAMBI is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced. (2.2, 5.1, 6.1) Liver-related events: Elevated transaminases (ALT/AST) have been observed in some cases associated with elevated bilirubin. Measure serum transaminases and bilirubin before initiating ORKAMBI, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Interrupt dosing in patients with ALT or AST >5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST >3 × ULN with bilirubin >2 × ULN. Following resolution, consider the benefits and risks of resuming dosing. (5.2, 6.1) Respiratory events: Chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal were observed more commonly during initiation of ORKAMBI. Clinical experience in patients with percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) <40 is limited, and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended during initiation of therapy. (5.3, 6.1) Blood pressure: Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients. Periodically monitor blood pressure in all patients. (5.4, 6.1) Drug interactions: Use with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may decrease systemic exposure of the medicinal products and co-administration is not recommended. Hormonal contraceptives should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception and their use is associated with increased menstruation-related adverse reactions. Use with strong CYP3A inducers may diminish exposure of ivacaftor, which may diminish its effectiveness; therefore, co-administration is not recommended. (5.5, 6.1, 7, 12.3) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor, a component of ORKAMBI. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating ORKAMBI. (5.6) 5.1 Use in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease Worsening of liver function, including hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with advanced liver disease has been reported in some patients with CF while receiving ORKAMBI. Use ORKAMBI with caution in patients with advanced liver disease and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If ORKAMBI is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment and the dose should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Liver-related Events Serious adverse reactions related to elevated transaminases have been reported in patients with CF receiving ORKAMBI. In some instances, these elevations have been associated with concomitant elevations in total serum bilirubin. It is recommended that ALT, AST, and bilirubin be assessed prior to initiating ORKAMBI, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. Patients who develop increased ALT, AST, or bilirubin should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST greater than 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) when not associated with elevated bilirubin. Dosing should also be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 × ULN when associated with bilirubin elevations greater than 2 × ULN. Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Respiratory Events Respiratory events (e.g., chest discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal) were observed more commonly in patients during initiation of ORKAMBI compared to those who received placebo. Clinical experience in patients with percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) <40 is limited, and additional monitoring of these patients is recommended during initiation of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Effect on Blood Pressure Increased blood pressure has been observed in some patients treated with ORKAMBI. Blood pressure should be monitored periodically in all patients being treated with ORKAMBI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Drug Interactions Substrates of CYP3A Lumacaftor is a strong inducer of CYP3A. Administration of ORKAMBI may decrease systemic exposure of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A, which may decrease therapeutic effect. Co-administration with sensitive CYP3A substrates or CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended. ORKAMBI may substantially decrease hormonal contraceptive exposure, reducing their effectiveness and increasing the incidence of menstruation-associated adverse reactions, e.g., amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual irregular (27% in women using hormonal contraceptives compared with 3% in women not using hormonal contraceptives). Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable, should not be relied upon as an effective method of contraception when co-administered with ORKAMBI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.11), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Strong CYP3A Inducers Ivacaftor is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. Use of ORKAMBI with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, significantly reduces ivacaftor exposure, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of ORKAMBI. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor, a component of ORKAMBI. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to ivacaftor cannot be excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating ORKAMBI treatment."
