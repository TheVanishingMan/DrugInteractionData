        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ibrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A (CYP3A). CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid co-administration with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce IMBRUVICA dose (2.4, 7.1). CYP3A Inducers: Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers (7.2). 7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors In healthy volunteers, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased Cmax and AUC of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively. The highest ibrutinib dose evaluated in clinical trials was 12.5 mg/kg (actual doses of 840 - 1400 mg) given for 28 days with single dose AUC values of 1445 ± 869 ng ∙ hr/mL which is approximately 50% greater than steady state exposures seen at the highest indicated dose (560 mg). Avoid concomitant administration of IMBRUVICA with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short-term (e.g., antifungals and antibiotics for 7 days or less, e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin) consider interrupting IMBRUVICA therapy during the duration of inhibitor use. Avoid strong CYP3A inhibitors that are needed chronically. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose. Patients taking concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of IMBRUVICA toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 CYP3A Inducers Administration of IMBRUVICA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ibrutinib Cmax and AUC by approximately 13- and 10-fold, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Second Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions (>=20%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL/SLL, and WM) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, nausea, bruising, fatigue, hemorrhage, and pyrexia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmacyclics at 1-877-877-3536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Mantle Cell Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in a clinical trial that included 111 patients with previously treated MCL treated with 560 mg daily with a median treatment duration of 8.3 months. The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (>= 20%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, bruising, dyspnea, constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite (see Tables 1 and 2). The most common Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse reactions (>= 5%) were pneumonia, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin infections. Fatal and serious cases of renal failure have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Increases in creatinine 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions from the MCL trial (N=111) using single agent IMBRUVICA 560 mg daily occurring at a rate of >= 10% are presented in Table 1.

The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was subdural hematoma (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients. Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression. Forty percent of patients had elevated uric acid levels on study including 13% with values above 10 mg/dL. Adverse reaction of hyperuricemia was reported for 15% of patients. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure in one single-arm, open-label clinical trial and three randomized controlled clinical trials in patients with CLL/SLL (n=1278 total and n=668 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA). Study 1 included 51 patients with previously treated CLL, Study 2 included 391 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or ofatumumab, Study 3 included 269 randomized patients 65 years or older with treatment naive-CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil and Study 4 included 578 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received IMBRUVICA in combination with bendamustine and rituximab or placebo in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 in patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA (>= 20%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, rash, bruising, fatigue, pyrexia and hemorrhage. Four to 10 percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, rash and neutropenia (1% each). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 6% of patients. Study 1 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from the CLL/SLL trial (N=51) using single agent IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL occurring at a rate of >= 10% with a median duration of treatment of 15.6 months are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in an open-label clinical trial that included 63 patients with previously treated WM. The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in the WM trial (>= 20%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, rash, nausea, muscle spasms, and fatigue. Six percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA in the WM trial discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities described below in Tables 9 and 10 reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA with a median duration of 11.7 months in the WM trial.

Grade 2 diarrhea occurred in 9% (range, 3% to 15%) and Grade 3 in 3% (range, 0 to 5%) of patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The median time to first onset of any grade diarrhea was 12 days (range, 0 to 627), of Grade 2 was 37 days (range, 1 to 667) and of Grade 3 was 71days (range, 3 to 627). Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 83% had complete resolution, 1% had partial improvement and 16% had no reported improvement at time of analysis. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade diarrhea was 5 days (range, 1 to 418), and was similar for Grades 2 and 3. Less than 1% of patients discontinued IMBRUVICA due to diarrhea. Visual Disturbance Blurred vision and decreased visual acuity of any grade occurred in 10% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA (9% Grade 1, 2% Grade 2). The median time to first onset was 88 days (range, 1 to 414 days). Of the patients with visual disturbance, 64% had complete resolution and 36% had no reported improvement at time of analysis. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement was 29 days (range, 1 to 281 days). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of IMBRUVICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic failure (includes multiple terms) Metabolic and nutrition disorders: tumor lysis syndrome [see Warnings & Precautions (5.7) ] Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Monitor for bleeding and manage (5.1). Infections: Monitor patients for fever and infections, evaluate promptly, and treat (5.2). Cytopenias: Check complete blood counts monthly (5.3). Atrial Fibrillation: Monitor for atrial fibrillation and manage (5.4). Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure and treat (5.5). Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies have occurred in patients, including skin cancers, and other carcinomas (5.6). Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Assess baseline risk and take precautions. Monitor and treat for TLS (5.7). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking the drug and for 1 month after cessation of therapy. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during the same time period (5.8, 8.3). 5.1 Hemorrhage Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Infections Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 29% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), (6.2)]. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately. 5.3 Cytopenias Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) based on laboratory measurements occurred in patients treated with single agent IMBRUVICA. Monitor complete blood counts monthly. 5.4 Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. Atrial fibrillation should be managed appropriately, and if it persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and follow dose modification guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.5 Hypertension Hypertension (range, 6 to 17%) has occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA with a median time to onset of 4.6 months (range, 0.03 to 22 months). Monitor patients for new onset hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting IMBRUVICA. Adjust existing anti-hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti-hypertensive treatment as appropriate. 5.6 Second Primary Malignancies Other malignancies (range, 5 to 16%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 4%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to 13%). 5.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryofetal toxicity including malformations at exposures that were 2-20 times higher than those reported in patients with MCL, CLL/SLL or WM. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after cessation of therapy. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."
