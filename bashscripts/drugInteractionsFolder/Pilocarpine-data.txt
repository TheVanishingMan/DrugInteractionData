        "Drug Interactions Pilocarpine should be administered with caution to patients taking beta adrenergic antagonists because of the possibility of conduction disturbances. Drugs with parasympathomimetic effects administered concurrently with pilocarpine would be expected to result in additive pharmacologic effects. Pilocarpine might antagonize the anticholinergic effects of drugs used concomitantly. These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., atropine, inhaled ipratropium). While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sjogren's efficacy studies: acetylsalicylic acid, artificial tears, calcium, conjugated estrogens, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, ibuprofen, levothyroxine sodium, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methotrexate, multivitamins, naproxen, omeprazole, paracetamol, and prednisone."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure in four controlled clinical trials of 90 days to 2 years duration in 317 patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the four clinical trials, patients were treated with Isopto(R) Carpine 2%, two to four times daily or with pilocarpine 1%, 1.75% or 2% in fixed combination with betaxolol 0.25%, two or three times daily.The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of patients in the pilocarpine 2% populations were: headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment (dim, dark, or "jumping" vision), and eye pain. The adverse reaction profile reported for the use of Isopto(R) Carpine in pediatric patients is comparable to that seen in adult patients. Most common adverse reactions are headache/browache, accommodative change, eye irritation, eye pain, blurred vision, and/or visual impairment ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alcon Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-757-9195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Poor illumination: Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination ( 5.1 ). Pre-existing retinal disease: Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported; a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy ( 5.2 ). Iritis: Caution is advised in patients with iritis. ( 5.3 ) Congenital glaucoma: Caution is advised in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of IOP as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Poor Illumination Patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination. In addition, miotics may cause accommodative spasm. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machinery if vision is not clear. 5.2 Pre-existing Retinal Disease As with all miotics, rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported when used in certain susceptible individuals and those with pre-existing retinal disease; therefore, a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy. 5.3 Iritis Isopto(R) Carpine is not recommended to be used when iritis is present. 5.4 Primary Congenital Glaucoma Caution is advised when using Isopto(R) Carpine in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of intraocular pressure (IOP) as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. In addition, the use of Isopto(R) Carpine is not recommended in pediatric patients diagnosed with glaucoma secondary to anterior segment dysgenesis or uveitis (especially if uveitis is active). 5.5 Contact Lens Wear Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of Isopto(R) Carpine ophthalmic solution and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure in four controlled clinical trials of 90 days to 2 years duration in 317 patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the four clinical trials, patients were treated with Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 2%, two to four times daily or with Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 1%, 1.75% or 2% in fixed combination with betaxolol 0.25%, two or three times daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of patients in the pilocarpine 2% populations were: headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment (dim, dark, or \"jumping\" vision), and eye pain. The adverse reaction profile reported for the use of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution in pediatric patients is comparable to that seen in adult patients. Most common adverse reactions are headache/browache, accommodative change, eye irritation, eye pain, blurred vision, and/or visual impairment (6.1) .

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Poor illumination: Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination (5.1) . - Pre-existing retinal disease: Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported; a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy (5.2) . - Iritis: Caution is advised in patients with iritis. (5.3) - Congenital glaucoma: Caution is advised in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of IOP as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. (5.4) 5.1 Poor Illumination Patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination. In addition, miotics may cause accommodative spasm. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machinery if vision is not clear. 5.2 Pre-existing Retinal Disease As with all miotics, rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported when used in certain susceptible individuals and those with pre-existing retinal disease; therefore, a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy. 5.3 Iritis Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended to be used when iritis is present. 5.4 Primary Congenital Glaucoma Caution is advised when using Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of intraocular pressure (IOP) as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. In addition, the use of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended in pediatric patients diagnosed with glaucoma secondary to anterior segment dysgenesis or uveitis (especially if uveitis is active). 5.5 Contact Lens Wear Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses."

        "Drug Interactions Pilocarpine should be administered with caution to patients taking beta-adrenergic antagonists because of the possibility of conduction disturbances. Drugs with parasympathomimetic effects administered concurrently with pilocarpine would be expected to result in additive pharmacologic effects. Pilocarpine might antagonize the anticholinergic effects of drugs used concomitantly. These effects should be considered when anticholinergic properties may be contributing to the therapeutic effect of concomitant medication (e.g., atropine, inhaled ipratropium). While no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, the following concomitant drugs were used in at least 10% of patients in either or both Sjogren's efficacy studies: acetylsalicylic acid, artificial tears, calcium, conjugated estrogens, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, ibuprofen, levothyroxine sodium, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methotrexate, multivitamins, naproxen, omeprazole, paracetamol, and prednisone."

The association with drug is uncertain. Sjogren's Syndrome Patients In controlled studies, 376 patients received pilocarpine, of whom 5% were men and 95% were women. Race distribution was 84% Caucasian, 9% Oriental, 3% Black, and 4% of other origin. Mean age was 55 years. The majority of patients were between 40 and 69 years (70%), 16% were 70 years and older and 14% were younger than 40 years of age. Of these patients, 161/629 (89/376 receiving pilocarpine) were over the age of 65 years. The adverse events reported by those over 65 years and those 65 years and younger were comparable except for notable trends for urinary frequency, diarrhea, and dizziness. The incidences of urinary frequency and diarrhea in the elderly were about double those in the non-elderly. The incidence of dizziness was about three times as high in the elderly as in the non-elderly. These adverse experiences were not considered to be serious. In the 2 placebo-controlled studies, the most common adverse events related to drug use were sweating, urinary frequency, chills, and vasodilatation (flushing).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS: OCULAR: Transient symptoms of stinging and burning may occur. Ciliary spasm, conjunctival vascular congestion, temporal or supraorbital headache, lacrimation and induced myopia may occur. This is especially true in younger individuals who have recently started administration. Reduced visual acuity in poor illumination is frequently experienced by older individuals and individuals with lens opacity. Miotic agents may also cause retinal detachment; thus, care should be exercised with all miotic therapy especially in young myopic patients. Lens opacity may occur with prolonged use of pilocarpine. SYSTEMIC: Systemic reactions following topical administration, although extremely rare, have included hypertension, tachycardia, bronchiolar spasm, pulmonary edema, salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure in four controlled clinical trials of 90 days to 2 years duration in 317 patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the four clinical trials, patients were treated with Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 2%, two to four times daily or with Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 1%, 1.75% or 2% in fixed combination with betaxolol 0.25%, two or three times daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of patients in the pilocarpine 2% populations were: headache/browache, accommodative change, blurred vision, eye irritation, visual impairment (dim, dark, or \"jumping\" vision), and eye pain. The adverse reaction profile reported for the use of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution in pediatric patients is comparable to that seen in adult patients."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Poor illumination: Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination (5.1) . - Pre-existing retinal disease: Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported; a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy (5.2) . - Iritis: Caution is advised in patients with iritis. (5.3) - Congenital glaucoma: Caution is advised in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of IOP as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. (5.4) Patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination. In addition, miotics may cause accommodative spasm. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machinery if vision is not clear. As with all miotics, rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported when used in certain susceptible individuals and those with pre-existing retinal disease; therefore, a thorough examination of the retina including funduscopy is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy. Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended to be used when iritis is present. Caution is advised when using Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution in pediatric patients with primary congenital glaucoma for control of intraocular pressure (IOP) as cases of a paradoxical increase in IOP have been reported. In addition, the use of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended in pediatric patients diagnosed with glaucoma secondary to anterior segment dysgenesis or uveitis (especially if uveitis is active). Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses."

Sweating N=121/68% N=141/ 29% N=152/9% Nausea 15 6 4 Rhinitis 14 5 7 Diarrhea 7 4 5 Chills 15 3 <1 Flushing 13 8 3 Urinary Frequency 12 9 7 Dizziness 12 5 4 Asthenia 12 6 3 In addition, the following adverse events (>=3% incidence) were reported at dosages of 15-30 mg/day in the controlled clinical trials: Adverse Event Pilocarpine HCI Placebo 5-10 mg t.i.d. (15-30 mg/day) (t.i.d.) Headache N=212/11% N=152/8% Dyspepsia 7 5 Lacrimation 6 8 Edema 5 4 Abdominal Pain 4 4 Amblyopia 4 2 Vomiting 4 1 Pharyngitis 3 8 Hypertension 3 1 The following events were reported with treated head and neck cancer patients at incidences of 1% to 2% at dosages of 7.5 to 30 mg/day: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, dysphagia, epistaxis, myalgias, pruritus, rash, sinusitis, tachycardia, taste perversion, tremor, voice alteration. The following events were reported rarely in treated head and neck cancer patients (<1%): Causal relation is unknown. Body as a whole: body odor, hypothermia, mucous membrane abnormality Cardiovascular: bradycardia, ECG abnormality, palpitations, syncope Digestive: anorexia, increased appetite, esophagitis, gastrointestinal disorder, tongue disorder Hematologic: leukopenia, lymphadenopathy Nervous: anxiety, confusion, depression, abnormal dreams, hyperkinesia, hypesthesia, nervousness, parethesias, speech disorder, twitching Respiratory: increased sputum, stridor, yawning Skin: seborrhea Special senses: deafness, eye pain, glaucoma Urogenital: dysuria, metrorrhagia, urinary impairment In long-term treatment were two patients with underlying cardiovascular disease of whom one experienced a myocardial infarct and another an episode of syncope. The association with drug is uncertain. Sjogren's Syndrome Patients: In controlled studies, 376 patients received pilocarpine, of whom 5% were men and 95% were women. Race distribution was 84% Caucasian, 9% Oriental, 3% Black, and 4% of other origin. Mean age was 55 years. The majority of patients were between 40 and 69 years (70%), 16% were 70 years and older and 14% were younger than 40 years of age. Of these patients, 161/629 (89/376 receiving pilocarpine) were over the age of 65 years. The adverse events reported by those over 65 years and those 65 years and younger were comparable except for notable trends for urinary frequency, diarrhea, and dizziness. The incidences of urinary frequency and diarrhea in the elderly were about double those of the non-elderly. The incidence of dizziness was about three times as high in the elderly as in the non-elderly. These adverse experiences were not considered to be serious. In the 2 placebo-controlled studies, the most common adverse events related to drug use were sweating, urinary frequency, chills, and vasodilatation (flushing). The most commonly reported reason for patient discontinuation of treatment was sweating. Expected pharmacologic effects of pilocarpine include the following adverse experiences associated with SALAGEN(R) Tablets: Adverse Event Pilocarpine HCI Placebo 5 mg q.i.d. (20 mg/day) (q.i.d) Sweating N=255/40% N=253/7% Urinary Frequency 10 4 Nausea 9 9 Flushing 9 2 Rhinitis 7 8 Diarrhea 6 7 Chills 4 2 Increased Salivation 3 0 Asthenia 2 2 In addition, the following adverse events (>=3% incidence) were reported at dosages of 20 mg/day in the controlled clinical trials: Adverse Event Pilocarpine HCI Placebo 5 mg q.i.d. 20 mg/day (q.i.d) Headache N=255/13% N=253/19% Flu Syndrome 9 9 Dyspepsia 7 7 Dizziness 6 7 Pain 4 2 Sinusitis 4 5 Abdominal Pain 3 4 Vomiting 3 1 Pharyngitis 2 5 Rash 2 3 Infection 2 6 The following events were reported in Sjogren's patients at incidences of 1% to 2% at dosing of 20 mg/day: accidental injury, allergic reaction, back pain, blurred vision, constipation, increased cough, edema, epistaxis, face edema, fever, flatulence, glossitis, lab test abnor-malities, including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, myalgia, palpitation, pruritus, somnolence, stomatitis, tachycardia, tinnitus, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and vaginitis. The following events were reported rarely in treated Sjogren's patients (<1%) at dosing of 10-30 mg/day: Causal relation is unknown. Body as a whole: chest pain, cyst, death, moniliasis, neck pain, neck rigidity, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, arrhythmia, ECG abnormality, hypotension, hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, migraine, myocardial infarction Digestive: anorexia, bilirubinemia, cholelithiasis, colitis, dry mouth, eructation, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gas-trointestinal disorder, gingivitis, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, melena, nausea & vomiting, pancreatitis, parotid gland enlargement, salivary gland enlargement, sputum increased, taste loss, tongue disorder, tooth disorder Hematologic: hematuria, lymphadenopathy, abnormal platelets, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, abnormal WBC Metabolic and Nutritional: peripheral edema, hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, bone disorder, spontaneous bone fracture, pathological fracture, myasthenia, tendon disorder, tenosynovitis Nervous: aphasia, confusion, depression, abnormal dreams, emotional lability, hyperkinesia, hypesthesia, insomnia, leg cramps, nervousness, parethesias, abnormal thinking, tremor Respiratory: bronchitis, dyspnea, hiccup, laryngismus, laryngitis, pneumonia, viral infection, voice alteration Skin: alopecia, contact dermatitis, dry skin, eczema, erythema nodosum, exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, skin ulcer, vesiculobullous rash Special Senses: cataract, conjunctivitis, dry eyes, ear disorder, ear pain, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, glaucoma, lacrimation disorder, retinal disorder, taste perversion, abnormal vision Urogenital: breast pain, dysuria, mastitis, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, ovarian disorder, pyuria, salpingitis, urethral pain, urinary urgency, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginal moniliasis The following adverse experiences have been reported rarely with ocular pilocarpine: A-V block, agitation, ciliary congestion, confusion, delusion, depression, dermatitis, middle ear disturbance, eyelid twitching, malignant glaucoma, iris cysts, macular hole, shock, and visual hallucination."
