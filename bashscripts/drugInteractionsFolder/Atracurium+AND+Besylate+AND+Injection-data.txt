Most adverse reactions were suggestive of histamine release.

Of the five patients who required treatment for hypotension, three had a history of significant cardiovascular disease. The overall incidence rate for clinically important adverse reactions, therefore, was 7/875 or 0.8%.

There are insufficient data to define the contribution, if any, of atracurium and/or its metabolite laudanosine. (See PRECAUTIONS: Long-Term Use in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)). There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including atracurium besylate.

In studies including 875 patients, atracurium was discontinued in only one patient (who required treatment for bronchial secretions) and six other patients required treatment for adverse reactions attributable to atracurium (wheezing in one, hypotension in five). Of the five patients who required treatment for hypotension, three had a history of significant cardiovascular disease. The overall incidence rate for clinically important adverse reactions, therefore, was 7/875 or 0.8%. Table 1 includes all adverse reactions reported attributable to atracurium during clinical trials with 875 patients. Table 1: Percent of Patients Reporting Adverse Reactions * Includes the recommended initial dosage range for most patients. Adverse Reaction Initial Atracurium Dose (mg/kg) 0.00-0.30 (n = 485) 0.31-0.50* (n = 366) ≥0.60 (n = 24) Total (n = 875) Skin Flush 1.0% 8.7% 29.2% 5.0% Erythema 0.6% 0.5% 0% 0.6% Itching 0.4% 0% 0% 0.2% Wheezing/Bronchial Secretions 0.2% 0.3% 0% 0.2% Hives 0.2% 0% 0% 0.1% Most adverse reactions were of little clinical significance unless they were associated with significant hemodynamic changes. Table 2 summarizes the incidences of substantial vital sign changes noted during atracurium clinical trials with 530 patients, without cardiovascular disease, in whom these parameters were assessed.

The following adverse reactions are among the most frequently reported, but there are insufficient data to support an estimate of their incidence: General: Allergic reactions (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid responses) which, in rare instances, were severe (e.g., cardiac arrest) Musculoskeletal: Inadequate block, prolonged block Cardiovascular: Hypotension, vasodilatation (flushing), tachycardia, bradycardia Respiratory: Dyspnea, bronchospasm, laryngospasm Integumentary: Rash, urticaria, reaction at injection site There have been rare spontaneous reports of seizures in ICU patients following long-term infusion of atracurium to support mechanical ventilation. There are insufficient data to define the contribution, if any, of atracurium and/or its metabolite laudanosine (see PRECAUTIONS: Long-Term Use in Intensive Care Unit [ICU] ). There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including atracurium besylate. These reactions, in some cases, have been life-threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ).

        "Drug Interactions Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium include: enflurane; isoflurane; halothane; certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins; lithium; magnesium salts; procainamide; and quinidine. If other muscle relaxants are used during the same procedure, the possibility of a synergistic or antagonist effect should be considered. The prior administration of succinylcholine does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by atracurium besylate. Atracurium should not be administered until a patient has recovered from succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular block."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Observed in Controlled Clinical Studies Atracurium was well tolerated and produced few adverse reactions during extensive clinical trials. Most adverse reactions were suggestive of histamine release.
