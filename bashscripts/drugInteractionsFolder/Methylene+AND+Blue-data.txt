Because of this product’s effect on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying, it may decrease the absorption of other oral medications during concurrent use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide diuretics (may cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde); antimuscarinics (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine sulfate because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications); antacids/antidiarrheals (may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate, concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline, reducing effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde). Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine sulfate; antimyasthenics (concurrent use with hyoscyamine sulfate may further reduce intestinal motility); ketoconazole (patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic side effects), opioid (narcotic analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation); sulfonamides (these drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing the danger of crystalluria).

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS: Do not exceed recommended dosage. This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy or cause blurred vision; use caution while driving, using machinery, or doing any activity that requires alertness or clear vision. Limit alcohol consumption. Cross sensitivity and/or related problems – patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids or salicylates may be intolerant of this medication also. Delay in gastric emptying could complicate the management of gastric ulcers. There have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use of this product in humans. No known long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Hyoscyamine sulfate and methenamine cross the placenta. Studies have not been done in animals or humans. It is not known whether UR N-C tablets cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. UR N-C tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Problems in humans have not been documented; however, methenamine and traces of hyoscyamine sulfate are excreted in breast milk. Accordingly, UR N-C tablets should be given to a lactating woman only if clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. Pediatric Use: Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids (hyoscyamine sulfate). This product contains salicylate, which is related to aspirin. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin, aspirin-containing or aspirin-related medications if they have chickenpox, influenza, or any undiagnosed illness without first consulting a doctor. A rare but serious illness known as Reye’s syndrome may occur. This medication is not recommended for children younger than 6 years. Geriatric Use: Kidney function becomes impaired with age. This medication is removed by the kidneys. Therefore, use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond to usual doses of hyoscyamine sulfate with excitement, agitation, drowsiness or confusion."

Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde. Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine. Antimyasthenics: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility, therefore, caution is recommended. Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH. Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketoconazole. Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects. Opioid (narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation. Sulfonamides: These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria. Patients should be advised that the urine and/or stools may become blue to blue-green as a result of the excretion of methylene blue. Drug Abuse And Dependence A dependence on the use of UroAv-B Capsules has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients, abuse of UroAv-B Capsules is not expected."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs Avoid concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE™ with medicinal products that enhance serotonergic transmission including SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), MAO inhibitors, bupropion, buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine and venlafaxine; because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Although the mechanism is not clearly, understood, literature reports suggest inhibition of MAO by methylene blue may be involved. In addition, in vitro studies cannot rule out the potential involvement of CYP 2D6 inhibition by methylene blue. If the intravenous use of PROVAYBLUE™ cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, choose the lowest possible dose and observe closely the patient for CNS effects for up to 4 hours after administration [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.1) ,Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . 7.2 Agents Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Methylene blue inhibits a range of CYP isozymes in vitro, including 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5. This interaction could be more pronounced with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by one of these enzymes (e.g, digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus). However, the clinical relevance of these in vitro interactions is unknown."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: If severe or life threatening allergic reaction occurs, discontinue PROVAYBLUE™, treat the allergic reaction, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve ( 5.2) Lack of Effectiveness: Consider alternative treatments if there is no resolution of methemoglobinemia after 2 doses ( 2.1, 5.3) Hemolytic Anemia: Discontinue PROVAYBLUE™ and transfuse ( 5.4) Interference with In-Vivo Monitoring Devices: Use methods other than pulse oximetry to assess oxygen satruation ( 5.5) Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Advise patients to refrain from these activities until neurologic and visual symptoms have resolved ( 5.6) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with use of methylene blue class products. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Avoid concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE™ with serotonergic drugs. Patients treated with PROVAYBLUE™ should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue use of PROVAYBLUE™, and initiate supportive treatment. Inform patients of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome and advise them to not to take serotonergic drugs within 72 hours after the last dose of PROVAYBLUE™ [see Drug Interactions ( 7), Patient Counseling Information ( 17)] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions to methylene blue class products have been reported. Patients treated with PROVAYBLUE™ should be monitored for anaphylaxis. If anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm) should occur, discontinue use of PROVAYBLUE™ and initiate supportive treatment. PROVAYBLUE™ is contraindicated in patients who have experienced anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reactions to a methylene blue class product in the past. 5.3 Lack of Effectiveness Methemoglobinemia may not resolve or may rebound after response to treatment with PROVAYBLUE™ in patients with methemoglobinemia due to aryl amines such as aniline or sulfa drugs such as dapsone. Monitor response to therapy with PROVAYBLUE™ through resolution of methemoglobinemia. If methemoglobinemia does not respond to 2 doses of PROVAYBLUE™ or if methemoglobinemia rebounds after a response, consider additional treatment options [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)] . Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may not reduce PROVAYBLUE™ to its active form in vivo. PROVAYBLUE™ may not be effective in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. 5.4 Hemolytic Anemia Hemolysis can occur during treatment of methemoglobinemia with PROVAYBLUE™. Laboratory testing may show Heinz bodies, elevated indirect bilirubin and low haptoglobin, but the Coombs test is negative. The onset of anemia may be delayed 1 or more days after treatment with PROVAYBLUE™. The anemia may require red blood cell transfusions. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. Use the lowest effective number of doses of PROVAYBLUE™ to treat methemoglobinemia. Discontinue PROVAYBLUE™ and consider alternative treatments of methemoglobinemia if severe hemolysis occurs. Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with PROVAYBLUE™ may result in severe hemolysis and severe anemia. PROVAYBLUE™ is contraindicated for use in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 5.5 Interference with In Vivo Monitoring Devices Inaccurate Pulse Oximeter Readings The presence of methylene blue in the blood may result in an underestimation of the oxygen saturation reading by pulse oximetry. If a measure of oxygen saturation is required during or shortly after infusion of PROVAYBLUE™, it is advisable to obtain an arterial blood sample for testing by an alternative method. Bispectral index monitor A fall in the Bispectral Index (BIS) has been reported following administration of methylene blue class products. If PROVAYBLUE™ is administered during surgery, alternative methods for assessing the depth of anesthesia should be employed. 5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery Treatment with PROVAYBLUE™ may cause confusion, dizziness and disturbances in vision [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)] . Advise patients to refrain from driving or engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until such adverse reactions to PROVAYBLUE™ have resolved. 5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests PROVAYBLUE™ is a blue dye which passes freely into the urine and may interfere with the interpretation of any urine test which relies on a blue indicator, such as the dipstick test for leucocyte esterase."

Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde. Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine. Antimyasthenics Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility, therefore, caution is recommended. Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH. Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketoconazole. Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects. Opioid (narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation. Sulfonamides These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria. Patients should be advised that the urine and/or stools may become blue to blue-green as a result of the excretion of methylene blue. Drug Abuse And Dependence A dependence on the use of URIMAR-T™ has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients, abuse of URIMAR T™ is not expected."

It is believed that when methylene blue is given to patients taking serotonergic psychiatric medications, high levels of serotonin can build up in the brain, causing toxicity. This is referred to as Serotonin Syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome include mental changes (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, diarrhea, trouble with coordination, and/or fever."
