        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been conducted with treprostinil administered subcutaneously (Remodulin) and orally (treprostinil diethanolamine). Pharmacodynamics Blood pressure lowering drugs (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or vasodilators): Risk of increased reduction in blood pressure (7.1) Remodulin inhibits platelet aggregation. Potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients on anticoagulants. (7.2) Remodulin dosage adjustment may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. (7.6) 7.1 Antihypertensive Agents or Other Vasodilators Concomitant administration of Remodulin with diuretics, antihypertensive agents or other vasodilators may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension. 7.2 Anticoagulants Since treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation, there may be an increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulants. Pharmacokinetics 7.3 Bosentan In a human pharmacokinetic study conducted with bosentan (250 mg/day) and an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine), no pharmacokinetic interactions between treprostinil and bosentan were observed. 7.4 Sildenafil In a human pharmacokinetic study conducted with sildenafil (60 mg/day) and an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine), no pharmacokinetic interactions between treprostinil and sildenafil were observed. 7.5 Effect of Treprostinil on Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies of human hepatic microsomes showed that treprostinil does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. Additionally, treprostinil does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Thus Remodulin is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds metabolized by CYP enzymes. 7.6 Effect of Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers on Treprostinil Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diethanolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure (both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to treprostinil. It has not been determined if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the parenteral (subcutaneously or intravenously) route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Remodulin has not been studied in conjunction with Flolan or Tracleer® (bosentan). 7.7 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil Drug interaction studies have been carried out with treprostinil (oral or subcutaneous) co-administered with acetaminophen (4 g/day), warfarin (25 mg/day), and fluconazole (200 mg/day), respectively in healthy volunteers. These studies did not show a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil. Treprostinil does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. The pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin and the INR in healthy subjects given a single 25 mg dose of warfarin were unaffected by continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil at an infusion rate of 10 ng/kg/min."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Infections associated with intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >3%) reported in clinical studies with Remodulin: subcutaneous infusion site pain and reaction, headache, diarrhea, nausea, jaw pain, vasodilatation, edema, and hypotension. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact United Therapeutics Corp. at 1-866-458-6479 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Events with Subcutaneously Administered Remodulin Patients receiving Remodulin as a subcutaneous infusion reported a wide range of adverse events, many potentially related to the underlying disease (dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, right ventricular heart failure, and pallor). During clinical trials with subcutaneous infusion of Remodulin, infusion site pain and reaction were the most common adverse events among those treated with Remodulin. Infusion site reaction was defined as any local adverse event other than pain or bleeding/bruising at the infusion site and included symptoms such as erythema, induration or rash. Infusion site reactions were sometimes severe and could lead to discontinuation of treatment. Table 3: Percentages of subjects reporting subcutaneous infusion site adverse events Reaction Pain Placebo Remodulin Placebo Remodulin Severe 1 38 2 39 Requiring narcoticsbased on prescriptions for narcotics, not actual use NAmedications used to treat infusion site pain were not distinguished from those used to treat site reactions NA 1 32 Leading to discontinuation 0 3 0 7 Other adverse events included diarrhea, jaw pain, edema, vasodilatation and nausea, and these are generally considered to be related to the pharmacologic effects of Remodulin, whether administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Adverse Reactions during Chronic Dosing Table 4 lists adverse reactions defined by a rate of at least 3% more frequent in patients treated with subcutaneous Remodulin than with placebo in controlled trials in PAH. Table 4: Adverse Reactions in Controlled 12-Week Studies of Subcutaneous Remodulin and at least 3% more frequent than on Placebo. Adverse Reaction Remodulin (N=236) Percent of Patients Placebo (N=233) Percent of Patients Infusion Site Pain 85 27 Infusion Site Reaction 83 27 Headache 27 23 Diarrhea 25 16 Nausea 22 18 Rash 14 11 Jaw Pain 13 5 Vasodilatation 11 5 Edema 9 3 Reported adverse reactions (at least 3% more frequent on drug than on placebo) are included except those too general to be informative, and those not plausibly attributable to the use of the drug, because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. While hypotension occurred in both groups, the event was experienced twice as frequently in the Remodulin group as compared to the placebo group (4% in Remodulin treatment group verses 2% in placebo-controlled group). As a potent vasodilator, hypotension is possible with the administration of Remodulin. The safety of Remodulin was also studied in a long-term, open-label extension study in which 860 patients were dosed for a mean duration of 1.6 years, with a maximum exposure of 4.6 years. Twenty-nine (29%) percent achieved a dose of at least 40 ng/kg/min (max: 290 ng/kg/min). The safety profile during this chronic dosing study was similar to that observed in the 12-week placebo controlled study except for the following suspected adverse drug reactions (occurring in at least 3% of patients): anorexia, vomiting, infusion site infection, asthenia, and abdominal pain. Adverse Events Attributable to the Drug Delivery System In controlled studies of Remodulin administered subcutaneously, there were no reports of infection related to the drug delivery system. There were 187 infusion system complications reported in 28% of patients (23% Remodulin, 33% placebo); 173 (93%) were pump related and 14 (7%) related to the infusion set. Eight of these patients (4 Remodulin, 4 Placebo) reported non-serious adverse events resulting from infusion system complications. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery systems were typically related to either symptoms of excess Remodulin (e.g., nausea) or return of PAH symptoms (e.g., dyspnea). These events were generally resolved by correcting the delivery system pump or infusion set problem such as replacing the syringe or battery, reprogramming the pump, or straightening a crimped infusion line. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery system did not lead to clinical instability or rapid deterioration. In addition to these adverse events due to the drug delivery system during subcutaneous administration, the following adverse events may be attributable to the IV mode of infusion including arm swelling, paresthesias, hematoma and pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of Remodulin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The following events have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, and potential connection to Remodulin. These events are thrombophlebitis associated with peripheral intravenous infusion, thrombocytopenia bone pain, pruritus and dizziness. In addition, generalized rashes, sometimes macular or papular in nature, and cellulitis have been infrequently reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS For intravenous infusion use an indwelling central venous catheter. This route is associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. (5.1) Do not abruptly lower the dose or withdraw dosing. (5.2) 5.1 Risk of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection Chronic intravenous infusions of Remodulin are delivered using an indwelling central venous catheter. This route is associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. Therefore, continuous subcutaneous infusion (undiluted) is the preferred mode of administration. In an open-label study of IV treprostinil (n=47), there were seven catheter-related line infections during approximately 35 patient years, or about 1 BSI event per 5 years of use. A CDC survey of seven sites that used IV treprostinil for the treatment of PAH found approximately 1 BSI (defined as any positive blood culture) event per 3 years of use. Administration of IV Remodulin with a high pH glycine diluent has been associated with a lower incidence of BSIs when compared to neutral diluents (sterile water, 0.9% sodium chloride) when used along with catheter care guidelines. 5.2 Worsening PAH upon Abrupt Withdrawal or Sudden Large Dose Reduction Avoid abrupt withdrawal or sudden large reductions in dosage of Remodulin, which may result in worsening of PAH symptoms. 5.3 Patients with Hepatic or Renal Insufficiency Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, because such patients will likely be exposed to greater systemic concentrations relative to patients with normal hepatic or renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Use In Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) increases exposure (both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) decreases exposure to treprostinil [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potential adverse reactions are described in Warnings and Precautions (5): -Decrease in systemic blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. -Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are cough, headache, nausea, dizziness, flushing, throat irritation, pharyngolaryngeal pain and diarrhea. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact United Therapeutics Corp. at 1-877-UNITHER (1-877-864-8437) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions Identified in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a 12-week placebo-controlled study (TRIUMPH I) of 235 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 and nearly all NYHA Functional Class III), the most commonly reported adverse reactions on Tyvaso included: cough and throat irritation; headache, gastrointestinal effects, muscle, jaw or bone pain, flushing and syncope. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 4% and were more frequent in patients treated with Tyvaso than with placebo. Table 1: Adverse Events in ≥ 4% of PAH Patients Receiving Tyvaso and More FrequentMore than 3% greater than placebo than Placebo Adverse Event Treatment n (%) Tyvaso n = 115 Placebo n = 120 Cough 62 (54) 35 (29) Headache 47 (41) 27 (23) Throat Irritation / Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 29 (25) 17 (14) Nausea 22 (19) 13 (11) Flushing 17 (15) 1 (<1) Syncope 7 (6) 1 (<1) The safety of Tyvaso was also studied in a long-term, open-label extension study in which 206 patients were dosed for a mean duration of 2.3 years, with a maximum exposure of 5.4 years. Eighty-nine (89%) percent of patients achieved the target dose of nine breaths, four times daily. Forty-two (42%) percent achieved a dose of 12 breaths four times daily. The adverse events during this chronic dosing study were qualitatively similar to those observed in the 12-week placebo controlled trial. Adverse Events Associated with Route of Administration Adverse events in the treated group during the double-blind and open-label phase reflecting irritation to the respiratory tract included: cough, throat irritation, pharyngeal pain, epistaxis, hemoptysis and wheezing. Serious adverse events during the open-label portion of the study included pneumonia in fifteen subjects. There were three serious episodes of hemoptysis (one fatal) noted during the open-label experience. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Identified in Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during the postapproval use of Tyvaso. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Angioedema."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with significant underlying lung disease (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). (5.1) In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, Tyvaso may cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2) Tyvaso may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants. (5.4, 7.2) Tyvaso dosage adjustments may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. (5.5, 7.5) Hepatic or renal insufficiency may increase exposure and decrease tolerability. (2.2, 2.3, 5.3) 5.1 Patients with Pulmonary Disease or Pulmonary Infections The safety and efficacy of Tyvaso have not been established in patients with significant underlying lung disease (e.g., asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Patients with acute pulmonary infections should be carefully monitored to detect any worsening of lung disease and loss of drug effect. 5.2 Risk of Symptomatic Hypotension Treprostinil is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, treatment with Tyvaso may produce symptomatic hypotension. 5.3 Patients with Hepatic or Renal Insufficiency Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency, because such patients will likely be exposed to greater systemic concentrations relative to patients with normal hepatic or renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Risk of Bleeding Since Tyvaso inhibits platelet aggregation, there may be an increased risk of bleeding, particularly among patients receiving anticoagulant therapy. 5.5 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase exposure (both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events associated with treprostinil administration, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."
