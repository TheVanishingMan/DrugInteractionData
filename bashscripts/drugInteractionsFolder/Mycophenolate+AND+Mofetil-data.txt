        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ).The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ).Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia / Syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ) •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single-dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30% to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®†) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in ten stable renal transplant patients. The mean (± SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (± 822) ng•h/mL and 753 (± 161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (± 1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (± 246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30% to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (± SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n = 10) were 54.3 (± 19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (± 1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (± 17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (± 2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n = 12) after coadministration were 80.9 (± 21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (± 13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (± 16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (± 11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which mycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (± 19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (± 6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (± 27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (± 10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p< 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (± SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (± 24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (± 23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (± 24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 days or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial) and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial) and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally cytomegalovirus viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1,483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Post-Marketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). •Serious life threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and C max. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox ® TC (10 mL q.i.d.). The C max and AUC(0 to 24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the C max and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil . Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g t.i.d. of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune ®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g b.i.d. of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC (0–12h) and C max of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC 0 to 12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and C max (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and C max of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g b.i.d.) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC (0 to 24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC (0 to 24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0 to 12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given two hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day eight of a ten day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered b.i.d., no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and C max of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day four of a five day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC 0 to 48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC 0 to 48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC 0 to 48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre‑dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC 0 to 12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a three-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a two-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (See PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (See WARNINGS : Serious Infections _Refand WARNINGS : New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial), and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals. (See PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial), and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (See WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥one year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (See WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 10 3/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (See WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine- controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of over suppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. New or Reactivated Viral Infections Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring patients infected with hepatitis B or C for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended. In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to<20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Intravenous Mycophenolate Mofetil The adverse event profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with intravenous mycophenolate mofetil. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo- controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study mycophenolate mofetil 2 g / day mycophenolate mofetil 3 g / day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg / kg / day or 100 to 150 mg / day mycophenolate mofetil 3 g / day Azathioprine 1 . 5 to 3 mg / kg / day mycophenolate mofetil 3 g / day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg / kg / day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cuta-neous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Muco-cutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections: Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil. OVERDOSAGE The experience with overdose of mycophenolate mofetil in humans is very limited. The events received from reports of overdose fall within the known safety profile of the drug. The highest dose administered to renal transplant patients in clinical trials has been 4 g/day. In limited experience with cardiac and hepatic transplant patients in clinical trials, the highest doses used were 4 g/day or 5 g/day. At doses of 4 g/day or 5 g/day, there appears to be a higher rate, compared to the use of 3 g/day or less, of gastrointestinal intolerance (nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), and occasional hematologic abnormalities, principally neutropenia, leading to a need to reduce or discontinue dosing. In acute oral toxicity studies, no deaths occurred in adult mice at doses up to 4000 mg/kg or in adult monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg; these were the highest doses of mycophenolate mofetil tested in these species. These doses represent 11 times the recommended clinical dose in renal transplant patients and approximately 7 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. In adult rats, deaths occurred after single-oral doses of 500 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil. The dose represents approximately 3 times the recommended clinical dose in cardiac transplant patients when corrected for BSA. MPA and MPAG are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (>100 mcg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By increasing excretion of the drug, MPA can be removed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics )."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC0-24h for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC0-12h and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concommitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC0-24h was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC0-24h significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to co-administer mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (Mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophe-nolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate mofetil intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) ) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections): Infections • Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally • There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. • Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. • Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. CellCept has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. CellCept may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that CellCept and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of CellCept (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. CellCept may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are coadministered with CellCept with caution and additional birth control methods be considered (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with CellCept. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after CellCept intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg∙h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg∙h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg∙h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 CellCept-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (CellCept alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of CellCept Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of CellCept. CellCept Oral The incidence of adverse events for CellCept was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the CellCept treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in CellCept and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving CellCept compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept or azathioprine. Patients receiving CellCept alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving CellCept 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study CellCept 2 g/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CellCept patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with CellCept than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with CellCept. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

CellCept Intravenous The adverse event profile of CellCept Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CellCept in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CellCept Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CellCept Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CellCept Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of CellCept Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous CellCept was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with CellCept. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving CellCept."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS : Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate. Mycophenolate Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Table 11 Adverse Events Reported in 3% to <20% of Patients Treated With Mycophenolate in Combination With Cyclosporine and Corticosteroids Body System Body as a Whole abdomen enlarged, abscess, accidental injury, cellulitis, chills occurring with fever, cyst, face edema, flu syndrome, hemorrhage, hernia, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, peritonitis Hematologic and Lymphatic coagulation disorder, ecchymosis, pancytopenia, petechia, polycythemia, prothrombin time increased, thromboplastin time increased Urogenital acute kidney failure, albuminuria, dysuria, hydronephrosis, hematuria, impotence, kidney failure, kidney tubular necrosis, nocturia, oliguria, pain, prostatic disorder, pyelonephritis, scrotal edema, urine abnormality, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary tract disorder Cardiovascular angina pectoris, arrhythmia, arterial thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, cardiovascular disorder, congestive heart failure, extrasystole, heart arrest, heart failure, hypotension, pallor, palpitation, pericardial effusion, peripheral vascular disorder, postural hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, supraventricular extrasystoles, syncope, tachycardia, thrombosis, vasodilatation, vasospasm, ventricular extrasystole, ventricular tachycardia, venous pressure increased Metabolic and Nutritional abnormal healing, acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased, alkalosis, bilirubinemia, creatinine increased, dehydration, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase increased, generalized edema, gout, hypercalcemia, hypercholesteremia, hyperlipemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, hypervolemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypoproteinemia, hypovolemia, hypoxia, lactic dehydrogenase increased, respiratory acidosis, SGOT increased, SGPT increased, thirst, weight gain, weight loss Digestive anorexia, cholangitis, cholestatic jaundice, dysphagia, esophagitis, flatulence, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal moniliasis, gingivitis, gum hyperplasia, hepatitis, ileus, infection, jaundice, liver damage, liver function tests abnormal, melena, mouth ulceration, nausea and vomiting, oral moniliasis, rectal disorder, stomach ulcer, stomatitis Respiratory apnea, asthma, atelectasis, bronchitis, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hiccup, hyperventilation, lung edema, lung disorder, neoplasm, pain, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, pneumonia, pneumothorax, respiratory disorder, respiratory moniliasis, rhinitis, sinusitis, sputum increased, voice alteration Skin and Appendages acne, alopecia, fungal dermatitis, hemorrhage, hirsutism, pruritus, rash, skin benign neoplasm, skin carcinoma, skin disorder, skin hypertrophy, skin ulcer, sweating, vesiculobullous rash Nervous agitation, anxiety, confusion, convulsion, delirium, depression, dry mouth, emotional lability, hallucinations, hypertonia, hypesthesia, nervousness, neuropathy, paresthesia, psychosis, somnolence, thinking abnormal, vertigo Endocrine Cushing’s syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, parathyroid disorder Musculoskeletal arthralgia, joint disorder, leg cramps, myalgia, myasthenia, osteoporosis Special Senses abnormal vision, amblyopia, cataract (not specified), conjunctivitis, deafness, ear disorder, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus, lacrimation disorder Pediatrics The type and frequency of adverse events in a clinical study in 100 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age dosed with Mycophenolate Mofetil oral suspension 600 mg/m2 bid (up to 1 g bid) were generally similar to those observed in adult patients dosed with Mycophenolate Mofetil Capsules at a dose of 1 g bid with the exception of abdominal pain, fever, infection, pain, sepsis, diarrhea, vomiting, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, hypertension, leukopenia, and anemia, which were observed in a higher proportion in pediatric patients. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections , New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC (0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that Mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC (0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC (0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC (0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended to co-administered mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptives methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ) Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxcin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (predose) from baseline (mycophenolate alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo- controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mycophenolate Azathioprine Mycophenolate Azathioprine Mycophenolate Azathioprine mofetil mofetil 1 to 2 mg / kg / day mofetil 1 . 5 to 3 mofetil 1 to 2 g / day 3 g / day or 100 to 150 3 g / day mg / kg / day 3 g / day 2 mg / kg / day mg / day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 –Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. CellCept has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. CellCept may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that CellCept and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving CellCept has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and CellCept. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with CellCept. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA's enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concommitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA's elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of CellCept (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. CellCept may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister CellCept with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with CellCept. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after CellCept intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg∙h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg∙h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg∙h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 CellCept-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (CellCept alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of CellCept Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of CellCept. CellCept Oral The incidence of adverse events for CellCept was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the CellCept treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in CellCept and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving CellCept compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept or azathioprine. Patients receiving CellCept alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving CellCept 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study CellCept 2 g/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CellCept patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with CellCept than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with CellCept. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

CellCept Intravenous The adverse event profile of CellCept Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CellCept in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CellCept Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CellCept Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CellCept Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of CellCept Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous CellCept was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ) Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with CellCept. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving CellCept."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single-dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30% to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®†) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in ten stable renal transplant patients. The mean (± SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (± 822) ng•h/mL and 753 (± 161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (± 1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (± 246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30% to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (± SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n = 10) were 54.3 (± 19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (± 1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (± 17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (± 2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n = 12) after coadministration were 80.9 (± 21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (± 13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (± 16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (± 11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which mycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (± 19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (± 6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (± 27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (± 10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p< 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (± SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (± 24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (± 23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (± 24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 days or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial) and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial) and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally cytomegalovirus viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1,483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Post-Marketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). •Serious life threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients.

In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNING: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV -Viremia/ Syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 -Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 -Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 -Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ) •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions: Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets have not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir: Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g. valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides: Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Cholestyramine: Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets are not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir: Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg·h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg·h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg·h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg·h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives: A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets with caution and additional birth control methods be considered (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy). Sevelamer: Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg·h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg·h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg·h/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole: Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsule or mycophenolate mofetil tablet is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg·h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg·h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg·h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (predose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin: In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsule or mycophenolate mofetil tablet is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions: The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics: Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS:Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS:Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets 3 g daily (see WARNINGS:Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS:Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 2 g / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1to 2 mg / kg / day or 100 to 150 mg / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1 . 5 to 3 mg / kg / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1to 2 mg / kg / day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous: The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience: Congenital Disorders: Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections: Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. CellCept has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. CellCept may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that CellCept and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of CellCept (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. CellCept may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are coadministered with CellCept with caution and additional birth control methods be considered (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with CellCept. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after CellCept intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg∙h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg∙h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg∙h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 CellCept-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (CellCept alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of CellCept Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of CellCept. CellCept Oral The incidence of adverse events for CellCept was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the CellCept treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in CellCept and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving CellCept compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept or azathioprine. Patients receiving CellCept alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving CellCept 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study CellCept 2 g/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CellCept patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with CellCept than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with CellCept. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

CellCept Intravenous The adverse event profile of CellCept Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CellCept in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CellCept Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CellCept Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CellCept Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of CellCept Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous CellCept was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with CellCept. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving CellCept."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions: Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets have not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir: Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g. valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides: Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Cholestyramine: Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets are not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir: Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg·h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg·h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg·h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg·h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives: A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets with caution and additional birth control methods be considered (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy). Sevelamer: Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg·h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg·h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg·h/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole: Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsule or mycophenolate mofetil tablet is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg·h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg·h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg·h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (predose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin: In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil capsule or mycophenolate mofetil tablet is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions: The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics: Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS:Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS:Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets 3 g daily (see WARNINGS:Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS:Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 2 g / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1to 2 mg / kg / day or 100 to 150 mg / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1 . 5 to 3 mg / kg / day MMF Capsules Or MMF Tablets 3 g / day Azathioprine 1to 2 mg / kg / day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous: The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience: Congenital Disorders: Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules or mycophenolate mofetil tablets in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections: Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil capsules and mycophenolate mofetil tablets."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and C max. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox ® TC (10 mL qid). The C max and AUC(0–24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the C max and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune ®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0–12h) and C max of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC 0-12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concommitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and C max (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and C max of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0–24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0–24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA C max and AUC 0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and C max of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC 0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC 0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC 0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre­dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC 0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

The placebo-controlled renal transplant study generally showed fewer adverse events occurring in ≥20% of patients. In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 10 3/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study MMF* 2 g/day MMF* 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day MMF* 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day MMF* 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 MMF= Mycophenolate Mofetil. The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients. (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to<20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders : Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections , New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox®† TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30% to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®†) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in ten stable renal transplant patients. The mean (± SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (± 822) ng•h/mL and 753 (± 161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (± 1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (± 246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30% to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when mycophenolate mofetil is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concommitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (± SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n = 10) were 54.3 (± 19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (± 1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (± 17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (± 2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n = 12) after coadministration were 80.9 (± 21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (± 13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (± 16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (± 11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which mycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (% CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (± 19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (± 6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (± 27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (± 10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p< 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (± SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (± 24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (± 23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (± 24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 days or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial), and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial), and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1,483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials.

In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL q.i.d.). The Cmax and AUC (0 to 24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g t.i.d. of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g b.i.d. of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC (0 to 12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0 to 12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g b.i.d.) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC (0 to 24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC (0 to 24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0 to 12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given two hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day eight of a ten day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered b.i.d., no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day four of a five day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0 to 48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p < 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0 to 48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0 to 48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre­dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0 to 12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a three-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a two-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS : New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial), and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial), and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥one year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity : Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ) Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus-infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. CellCept has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. CellCept may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that CellCept and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving CellCept has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and CellCept. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with CellCept. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of CellCept (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. CellCept may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister CellCept with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with CellCept. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after CellCept intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg∙h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg∙h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg∙h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 CellCept-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (CellCept alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of CellCept Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of CellCept. CellCept Oral The incidence of adverse events for CellCept was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the CellCept treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in CellCept and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving CellCept compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept or azathioprine. Patients receiving CellCept alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving CellCept 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study CellCept 2 g/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CellCept patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with CellCept than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with CellCept. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

CellCept Intravenous The adverse event profile of CellCept Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CellCept in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CellCept Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CellCept Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CellCept Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of CellCept Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous CellCept was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ) •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with CellCept. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving CellCept."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox®5 TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (±17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.2 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.1 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS:Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil USP alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg·h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS:Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS:Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10: Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate 2 g/day (n=336) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=330) % Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day (n=326) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=289) % Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day (n=289) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=277) % Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=287) % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil USP during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections(see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ).The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNING: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV -Viremia/ Syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 -Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 -Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 -Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC0-24h for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC0-12h and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concommitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) mcg•h/ mL and 10.6 (±2.0) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC0-24h was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC0-24h significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to co-administer mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (Mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: Latent New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophe-nolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophe-nolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathio-prine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS : Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate mofetil intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS : Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS : Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections): Infections • Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally • There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. • Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. • Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. ProtonPumpInhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (± SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (± 822) ng•h/mL and 753 (± 161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (± 1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (± 246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclosporine A interferes with MPA enterohepatic recirculation. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine; changes in MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from cyclosporine A to one of the immunosuppressants which do not interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g., tacrolimus; belatacept). Telmisartan Concomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced UGT1A9 expression and activity. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (± SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n = 10) were 54.3 (± 19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (± 1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (± 17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (± 2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n = 12) after coadministration were 80.9 (± 21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (± 13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (± 16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (± 11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (% CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (± 19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34.0 (± 6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (± 27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (± 10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p < 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (± SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (± 24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (± 23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (± 24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3 fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2 fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Immunizations ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections, e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS, Serious Infections and WARNINGS, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS, Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS, Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1 year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS, Neutropenia ; PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ; and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS, Serious Infections and WARNINGS, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10: Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS, Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity:Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections: (see WARNINGS, Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. CellCept has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. CellCept may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that CellCept and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of CellCept. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng∙h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng∙h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30-50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19.0) µg∙h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) µg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51.0 (±17.0) µg∙h/mL and 10.6 (±2.0) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) µg∙h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) µg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) µg∙h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of CellCept (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. CellCept may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. However, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are coadministered with CellCept with caution and additional birth control methods be considered (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with CellCept. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after CellCept intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) µg∙h/mL and 34.0 (±6.6) µg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) µg∙h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) µg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) µg∙h/mL and 42.7 (±23) µg∙h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) µg∙h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 CellCept-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (CellCept alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, CellCept is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of CellCept Intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of CellCept. CellCept Oral The incidence of adverse events for CellCept was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the CellCept treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in CellCept and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving CellCept compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept or azathioprine. Patients receiving CellCept alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 103/µL) developed in up to 2.0% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving CellCept 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Infections and WARNINGS: Latent Viral Infections ). Table 9 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 9 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study CellCept 2 g/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day CellCept 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20.0 19.0 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV – Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10.0 14.1 12.2 – Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8.0 Herpes zoster 6.0 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 – Cutaneous disease 6.0 7.3 5.5 10.0 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17.0 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 – Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18.0 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in CellCept patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with CellCept than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with CellCept. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with CellCept, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

CellCept Intravenous The adverse event profile of CellCept Intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral CellCept in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of CellCept Intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of CellCept Intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with CellCept Intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of CellCept Intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous CellCept was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders Congenital malformations including ear malformations have been reported in offspring of patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see WARNINGS: Pregnancy ). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with CellCept. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. BK virus-associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving CellCept."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single-dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox® TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30% to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®†) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in ten stable renal transplant patients. The mean (± SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (± 822) ng•h/mL and 753 (± 161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (± 1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (± 246) ng/mL, respectively, one week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30% to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (± SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n = 10) were 54.3 (± 19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (± 1.8) mcg/mL, respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (± 17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (± 2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n = 12) after coadministration were 80.9 (± 21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (± 13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (± 16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (± 11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which mycophenolate mofetil and ganciclovir or its prodrug (e.g., valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over three consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (± SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (± 19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (± 6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (± 27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (± 10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p< 0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (± SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (± 24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (± 23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (± 24) mcg•h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 days or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS: Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g., opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (two active, one placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (one active-controlled trial) and hepatic (one active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (two trials), cardiac (one trial) and hepatic (one trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than one year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally cytomegalovirus viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). The incidence of malignancies among the 1,483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥ 1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least one year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the one year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate Mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate Mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n = 336) (n = 330) (n = 326) (n = 289) (n = 289) (n = 277) (n = 287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV - Viremia/syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 - Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 - Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 - Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Post-Marketing Experience Congenital Disorders Embryofetal Toxicity Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections). •Serious life threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. • Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "Drug Interactions Drug interaction studies with mycophenolate mofetil have been conducted with acyclovir, antacids, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, ganciclovir, oral contraceptives, sevelamer, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, and metronidazole. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with other drugs that may be commonly administered to renal, cardiac or hepatic transplant patients. Mycophenolate mofetil has not been administered concomitantly with azathioprine. Acyclovir Coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) and acyclovir (800 mg) to 12 healthy volunteers resulted in no significant change in MPA AUC and Cmax. However, MPAG and acyclovir plasma AUCs were increased 10.6% and 21.9%, respectively. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are acyclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate and acyclovir or its prodrug (eg, valacyclovir) to compete for tubular secretion, further increasing the concentrations of both drugs. Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Absorption of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil (2 g) was decreased when administered to ten rheumatoid arthritis patients also taking Maalox®5 TC (10 mL qid). The Cmax and AUC(0-24h) for MPA were 33% and 17% lower, respectively, than when mycophenolate mofetil was administered alone under fasting conditions. Mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to patients who are also taking antacids containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, it is recommended that mycophenolate mofetil and the antacid not be administered simultaneously. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Coadministration of PPIs (e.g., lansoprazole, pantoprazole) in single doses to healthy volunteers and multiple doses to transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil has been reported to reduce the exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA). An approximate reduction of 30 to 70% in the Cmax and 25% to 35% in the AUC of MPA has been observed, possibly due to a decrease in MPA solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical impact of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving PPIs and mycophenolate mofetil. Because clinical relevance has not been established, PPIs should be used with caution when coadministered to transplant patients being treated with mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine Following single-dose administration of 1.5 g mycophenolate mofetil to 12 healthy volunteers pretreated with 4 g tid of cholestyramine for 4 days, MPA AUC decreased approximately 40%. This decrease is consistent with interruption of enterohepatic recirculation which may be due to binding of recirculating MPAG with cholestyramine in the intestine. Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is also anticipated following intravenous administration of mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation. Cyclosporine Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) pharmacokinetics (at doses of 275 to 415 mg/day) were unaffected by single and multiple doses of 1.5 g bid of mycophenolate mofetil in 10 stable renal transplant patients. The mean (±SD) AUC(0-12h) and Cmax of cyclosporine after 14 days of multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil were 3290 (±822) ng•h/mL and 753 (±161) ng/mL, respectively, compared to 3245 (±1088) ng•h/mL and 700 (±246) ng/mL, respectively, 1 week before administration of mycophenolate mofetil. In renal transplant patients, mean MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) was approximately 30 to 50% greater when mycophenolate mofetil is administered without cyclosporine compared with when mycophenolate mofetil is coadministered with cyclosporine. This interaction is due to cyclosporine inhibition of multidrug-resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) transporter in the biliary tract, thereby preventing the excretion of MPAG into the bile that would lead to enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. This information should be taken into consideration when MMF is used without cyclosporine. Ganciclovir Following single-dose administration to 12 stable renal transplant patients, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg). Mean (±SD) ganciclovir AUC and Cmax (n=10) were 54.3 (±19) mcg•h/mL and 11.5 (±1.8) mcg/mL respectively, after coadministration of the two drugs, compared to 51 (±17) mcg•h/mL and 10.6 (±2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of intravenous ganciclovir alone. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA (n=12) after coadministration were 80.9 (±21.6) mcg•h/mL and 27.8 (±13.9) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to values of 80.3 (±16.4) mcg•h/mL and 30.9 (±11.2) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur. In patients with renal impairment in which MMF and ganciclovir or its prodrug (eg, valganciclovir) are coadministered, patients should be monitored carefully. Oral Contraceptives A study of coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g bid) and combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.2 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.1 mg) was conducted in 18 women with psoriasis over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Mean AUC(0-24h) was similar for ethinylestradiol and 3-keto desogestrel; however, mean levonorgestrel AUC(0-24h) significantly decreased by about 15%. There was large inter-patient variability (%CV in the range of 60% to 70%) in the data, especially for ethinylestradiol. Mean serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. Mycophenolate mofetil may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of the studied oral contraceptives. It is recommended to coadminister mycophenolate mofetil with hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used (see PRECAUTIONS:Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning ). Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively. This data suggest that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolate mofetil. Alternatively, it is recommended that sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders preferentially could be given 2 hours after mycophenolate mofetil intake to minimize the impact on the absorption of MPA. Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g) to 12 healthy male volunteers on day 8 of a 10 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg administered bid, no effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. The mean (±SD) AUC and Cmax of MPA after concomitant administration were 75.2 (±19.8) mcg•h/mL and 34 (±6.6) mcg/mL, respectively, compared to 79.2 (±27.9) mcg•h/mL and 34.2 (±10.7) mcg/mL, respectively, after administration of mycophenolate mofetil USP alone. Norfloxacin and Metronidazole Following single-dose administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g) to 11 healthy volunteers on day 4 of a 5 day course of a combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole, the mean MPA AUC0-48h was significantly reduced by 33% compared to the administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone (p<0.05). Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. There was no significant effect on mean MPA AUC0-48h when mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. The mean (±SD) MPA AUC0-48h after coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately was 48.3 (±24) mcg•h/mL and 42.7 (±23) mcg•h/mL, respectively, compared with 56.2 (±24) mcg·h/mL after administration of mycophenolate mofetil alone. Ciprofloxacin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid A total of 64 mycophenolate mofetil-treated renal transplant recipients received either oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 375 mg tid for 7 or at least 14 days. Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (pre-dose) from baseline (mycophenolate mofetil alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear. Rifampin In a single heart-lung transplant patient, after correction for dose, a 67% decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) has been observed with concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and rifampin. Therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk. Other Interactions The measured value for renal clearance of MPAG indicates removal occurs by renal tubular secretion as well as glomerular filtration. Consistent with this, coadministration of probenecid, a known inhibitor of tubular secretion, with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys results in a 3-fold increase in plasma MPAG AUC and a 2-fold increase in plasma MPA AUC. Thus, other drugs known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other drug undergoing tubular secretion. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with mycophenolate mofetil by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption. Live Vaccines During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective (see PRECAUTIONS:Immunizations). Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS ). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

In addition, those that occurred were not only qualitatively similar to the azathioprine-controlled renal transplant studies, but also occurred at lower rates, particularly for infection, leukopenia, hypertension, diarrhea and respiratory infection. The above data demonstrate that in three controlled trials for prevention of renal rejection, patients receiving 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil had an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil. The above data demonstrate that the types of adverse events observed in multicenter controlled trials in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients are qualitatively similar except for those that are unique to the specific organ involved. Sepsis, which was generally CMV viremia, was slightly more common in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients treated with azathioprine. The incidence of sepsis was comparable in mycophenolate mofetil and in azathioprine-treated patients in cardiac and hepatic studies. In the digestive system, diarrhea was increased in renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil compared to patients receiving azathioprine, but was comparable in hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil alone or as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). The incidence of malignancies among the 1483 patients treated in controlled trials for the prevention of renal allograft rejection who were followed for ≥1 year was similar to the incidence reported in the literature for renal allograft recipients. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year (see WARNINGS: Lymphoma and Malignancy ). Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 103/mcL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia , PRECAUTIONS:Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10: Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate 2 g/day (n=336) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=330) % Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day (n=326) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=289) % Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day (n=289) % Mycophenolate 3 g/day (n=277) % Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=287) % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV Viremia/ syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to <20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil USP during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Digestive: Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections(see WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. •Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory: Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections eg, opportunistic infection (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infections ). The adverse event profile associated with the administration of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous has been shown to be similar to that observed after administration of oral dosage forms of mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse events for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in prevention of rejection in renal (2 active, 1 placebo-controlled trials), cardiac (1 active-controlled trial), and hepatic (1 active-controlled trial) transplant patients. Geriatrics Elderly patients (≥ 65 years), particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals (see PRECAUTIONS). Safety data are summarized below for all active-controlled trials in renal (2 trials), cardiac (1 trial), and hepatic (1 trial) transplant patients. Approximately 53% of the renal patients, 65% of the cardiac patients, and 48% of the hepatic patients have been treated for more than 1 year. Adverse events reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below.

Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides lymphoproliferative disorder (2/148 patients) have been observed. Severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 103/µL) developed in up to 2% of renal transplant patients, up to 2.8% of cardiac transplant patients and up to 3.6% of hepatic transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All transplant patients are at increased risk of opportunistic infections. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections and WARNINGS: New or Reactivated Viral Infection s). Table 10 shows the incidence of opportunistic infections that occurred in the renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant populations in the azathioprine-controlled prevention trials: Table 10 Viral and Fungal Infections in Controlled Studies in Prevention of Renal, Cardiac or Hepatic Transplant Rejection Renal Studies Cardiac Study Hepatic Study Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 100 to 150 mg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day Mycophenolate mofetil 3 g/day Azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day (n=336) (n=330) (n=326) (n=289) (n=289) (n=277) (n=287) % % % % % % % Herpes simplex 16.7 20 19 20.8 14.5 10.1 5.9 CMV Viremia/ Syndrome 13.4 12.4 13.8 12.1 10 14.1 12.2 Tissue invasive disease 8.3 11.5 6.1 11.4 8.7 5.8 8 Herpes zoster 6 7.6 5.8 10.7 5.9 4.3 4.9 Cutaneous disease 6 7.3 5.5 10 5.5 4.3 4.9 Candida 17 17.3 18.1 18.7 17.6 22.4 24.4 Mucocutaneous 15.5 16.4 15.3 18 17.3 18.4 17.4 The following other opportunistic infections occurred with an incidence of less than 4% in mycophenolate mofetil patients in the above azathioprine-controlled studies: Herpes zoster, visceral disease; Candida, urinary tract infection, fungemia/disseminated disease, tissue invasive disease; Cryptococcosis; Aspergillus/Mucor; Pneumocystis carinii. In the placebo-controlled renal transplant study, the same pattern of opportunistic infection was observed compared to the azathioprine-controlled renal studies, with a notably lower incidence of the following: Herpes simplex and CMV tissue-invasive disease. In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g) in controlled studies for prevention of renal, cardiac or hepatic rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of renal and cardiac patients and in 5% of hepatic patients (see WARNINGS: Serious Infections ). In cardiac transplant patients, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections was approximately 10% higher in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil than in those receiving azathioprine, but this difference was not associated with excess mortality due to infection/sepsis among patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The following adverse events were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Mycophenolate Mofetil Intravenous The adverse event profile of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was determined from a single, double-blind, controlled comparative study of the safety of 2 g/day of intravenous and oral mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant patients in the immediate posttransplant period (administered for the first 5 days). The potential venous irritation of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous was evaluated by comparing the adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous with those observed in the intravenous placebo group; patients in this group received active medication by the oral route. Adverse events attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed at 4% in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil intravenous. In the active controlled study in hepatic transplant patients, 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil intravenous were administered in the immediate posttransplant period (up to 14 days). The safety profile of intravenous mycophenolate mofetil was similar to that of intravenous azathioprine. Postmarketing Experience Congenital Disorders: Embryofetal Toxicity: Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Digestive Colitis (sometimes caused by cytomegalovirus), pancreatitis, isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy. Hematologic and Lymphatic Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. Infections (See WARNINGS: Serious Infections, New or Reactivated Viral Infections ): •Serious life-threatening infections such as meningitis and infectious endocarditis have been reported occasionally. •There is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of serious infections such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. •Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. The reported cases generally had risk factors for PML, including treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. •Polyomavirus associated neuropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. This infection is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Respiratory Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in posttransplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil."
