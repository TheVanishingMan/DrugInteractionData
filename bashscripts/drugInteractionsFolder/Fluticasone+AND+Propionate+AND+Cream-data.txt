Subjects whose lesions cleared after 2 or 3 weeks of treatment continued to apply fluticasone propionate lotion for an additional week. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 14%. These were local, cutaneous reactions and included dry skin (7%), stinging at application site (5%), and excoriation (2%). Additionally, a 4-month-old patient treated with fluticasone propionate lotion had marked elevations of the hepatic enzymes AST and ALT.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: Reversible HPA axis suppression and resulting glucocorticoid insufficiency can occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, use over large surface area, prolonged use, use under occlusion, concomitant use with other corticosteroid-containing products, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Minimize risk by mitigating the risk factors and use product as recommended. Modify use if HPA axis suppression is suspected. (5.1 , 8.4) •Skin Irritation and Sensitization: fluticasone propionate lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops. (5.2) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression and Other Adverse Endocrine Effects Topical corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate lotion, can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticoid insufficiency. Risk factors that predispose to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use under occlusion, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, and liver failure. Pediatric patients may be at greater risk of HPA axis suppression due to their higher skin surface area to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. HPA axis suppression may occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. If HPA axis suppression is suspected, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent topical corticosteroid. Evaluation of HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. The effects of fluticasone propionate lotion on HPA axis function in pediatric patients were investigated in two trials. Among a total of 89 evaluable subjects from the two trials who were treated with fluticasone propionate lotion twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks, a single subject with >90% body surface area treated showed laboratory evidence of transient suppression immediately post-treatment. The post cosyntropin stimulation test serum cortisol returned to a normal level (22.1 µg/dL) within one week of the final treatment visit [see Use In Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Fluticasone propionate lotion may cause local adverse reactions, including skin atrophy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The risk is greater with use under occlusion and with higher potency products. Fluticasone propionate lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Avoid using fluticasone propionate lotion in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis. If irritation develops, discontinue fluticasone propionate lotion and institute appropriate therapy. Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation can be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. Discontinue fluticasone propionate lotion if appropriate. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If skin infections are present or develop at the treatment site, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of fluticasone propionate lotion until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION In controlled clinical trials of twice-daily administration, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of Fluticasone Propionate Cream was approximately 4%. These adverse reactions were usually mild; self-limiting; and consisted primarily of pruritus, dryness, numbness of fingers, and burning. These events occurred in 2.9%, 1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively. Two clinical studies compared once- to twice-daily administration of Fluticasone Propionate Cream for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema. The local drug-related adverse events for the 491 patients enrolled in both studies are shown in Table 1. In the study enrolling both adult and pediatric patients, the incidence of local adverse events in the 119 pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years was comparable to the 140 patients ages 13 to 62 years. Fifty-one pediatric patients ages 3 months to 5 years, with moderate to severe eczema, were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. Fluticasone Propionate Cream was applied twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks over an arithmetic mean body surface area of 64% (range, 35% to 95%). The mean morning cortisol levels with standard deviations before treatment (prestimulation mean value = 13.76 ± 6.94 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 30.53 ± 7.23 mcg/dL) and at end treatment (prestimulation mean value = 12.32 ± 6.92 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 28.84 ± 7.16 mcg/dL) showed little change. In 2 of 43 (4.7%) patients with end-treatment results, peak cortisol levels following cosyntropin stimulation testing were <18 µg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-645-9833 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Controlled Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In 2 multicenter vehicle-controlled clinical trials of once-daily application of fluticasone propionate lotion by 196 adult and 242 pediatric patients, the total incidence of adverse reactions considered drug related by investigators was approximately 4%. These were local cutaneous reactions, usually mild and self-limiting, and consisted primarily of burning/stinging (2%). All other drug-related events occurred with an incidence of less than 1%, and included were contact dermatitis, exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, folliculitis of legs, pruritus, pustules on arm, rash, and skin infection. See Table 1. The incidence of adverse reactions between the 242 pediatric subjects (age 3 months to < 17 years) and 196 adult subjects (17 years or older) was similar (4% and 5%, respectively).

Subjects whose lesions cleared after 2 or 3 weeks of treatment continued to apply fluticasone propionate lotion for an additional week. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 14%. These were local, cutaneous reactions and included dry skin (7%), stinging at application site (5%), and excoriation (2%). Additionally, a 4-month-old patient treated with fluticasone propionate lotion had marked elevations of the hepatic enzymes AST and ALT. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] In another open label HPA axis suppression trial in which fluticasone propionate lotion was also applied twice daily (rather than the indicated dosing regimen of once daily), 56 pediatric subjects (ages ≥3 months to 12 months), were enrolled [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The adverse reactions included 2 cases of Herpes simplex at the application site (3.6%) and 3 cases of bacterial skin infections (5.4%). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following local adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fluticasone propionate lotion: erythema, edema/swelling, and bleeding. The following systemic adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fluticasone propionate cream and fluticasone propionate ointment: immunosuppression/Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia; hyperglycemia/ glycosuria; Cushing syndrome; generalized body edema/blurred vision; and acute urticarial reaction (edema, urticaria, pruritus, and throat swelling). The following local adverse reactions have also been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings or higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions include: acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, skin atrophy, striae, hypertrichosis and miliaria. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: Reversible HPA axis suppression and resulting glucocorticoid insufficiency can occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, use over large surface area, prolonged use, use under occlusion, concomitant use with other corticosteroid-containing products, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Minimize risk by mitigating the risk factors and use product as recommended. Modify use if HPA axis suppression is suspected. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) • Skin Irritation and Sensitization: fluticasone propionate lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression and Other Adverse Endocrine Effects Topical corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate lotion, can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticoid insufficiency. Risk factors that predispose to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, and use under occlusion, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, and liver failure. Pediatric patients may be at greater risk of HPA axis suppression due to their higher skin surface area to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. HPA axis suppression may occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. If HPA axis suppression is suspected, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent topical corticosteroid. Evaluation of HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. The effects of fluticasone propionate lotion on HPA axis function in pediatric patients were investigated in two trials. Among a total of 89 evaluable subjects from the two trials who were treated with fluticasone propionate lotion twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks, a single subject with >90% body surface area treated showed laboratory evidence of transient suppression immediately post-treatment. The post cosyntropin stimulation test serum cortisol returned to a normal level (22.1µg/dL) within one week of the final treatment visit [see Use In Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Fluticasone propionate lotion may cause local adverse reactions, including skin atrophy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. The risk is greater with use under occlusion and with higher potency products. Fluticasone propionate lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Avoid using fluticasone propionate lotion in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis. If irritation develops, discontinue fluticasone propionate lotion and institute appropriate therapy. Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation can be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. Discontinue fluticasone propionate lotion if appropriate. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If skin infections are present or develop at the treatment site, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of fluticasone propionate lotion until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials of twice-daily administration, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of CUTIVATE® Cream was approximately 4%. These adverse reactions were usually mild; self-limiting; and consisted primarily of pruritus, dryness, numbness of fingers, and burning. These events occurred in 2.9%, 1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively. Two clinical studies compared once- to twice-daily administration of CUTIVATE® Cream for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema. The local drug-related adverse events for the 491 patients enrolled in both studies are shown in Table 1. In the study enrolling both adult and pediatric patients, the incidence of local adverse events in the 119 pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years was comparable to the 140 patients ages 13 to 62 years. Fifty-one pediatric patients ages 3 months to 5 years, with moderate to severe eczema, were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. CUTIVATE® Cream was applied twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks over an arithmetic mean body surface area of 64% (range, 35% to 95%). The mean morning cortisol levels with standard deviations before treatment (prestimulation mean value = 13.76 ± 6.94 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 30.53 ± 7.23 mcg/dL) and at end treatment (prestimulation mean value = 12.32 ± 6.92 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 28.84 ± 7.16 mcg/dL) showed little change. In 2 of 43 (4.7%) patients with end-treatment results, peak cortisol levels following cosyntropin stimulation testing were ≤18 μg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. Follow-up testing after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis. Local drug-related adverse events were transient burning, resolving the same day it was reported; transient urticaria, resolving the same day it was reported; erythematous rash; dusky erythema, resolving within 1 month after cessation of CUTIVATE® Cream; and telangiectasia, resolving within 3 months after stopping CUTIVATE® Cream.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: Reversible HPA axis suppression and resulting clinical glucocorticoid insufficiency can occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include use over large surface area, prolonged use, use under occlusion, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Modify use if HPA axis suppression is suspected. (5.1) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression and Other Adverse Endocrine Effects Topical corticosteroids, including CUTIVATE® Ointment, can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticoid insufficiency. Factors that predispose to HPA axis suppression include large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use under occlusion, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. If HPA axis suppression is suspected, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. Pediatric patients may be at greater risk of HPA axis suppression due to their higher skin surface area to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. HPA axis suppression may occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. If HPA axis suppression is suspected, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Evaluation of HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions CUTIVATE® Ointment may cause local adverse reactions, including skin atrophy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2)]. The risk is greater with use under occlusion. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation can be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. Discontinue CUTIVATE® Ointment if appropriate. 5.4 Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, use an appropriate antimicrobial. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of CUTIVATE® Ointment until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: •HPA Axis Suppression and Other Adverse Endocrine Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] •Local Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] •Concomitant Skin Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions (2%) were burning/stinging at the application site. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact PharmaDerm®, A division of Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-645-9833 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Controlled Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In 2 multicenter vehicle-controlled clinical trials of once-daily application of CUTIVATE® Lotion by 196 adult and 242 pediatric patients, the total incidence of adverse reactions considered drug related by investigators was approximately 4%. These were local cutaneous reactions, usually mild and self-limiting, and consisted primarily of burning/stinging (2%). All other drug-related events occurred with an incidence of less than 1%, and included were contact dermatitis, exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, folliculitis of legs, pruritus, pustules on arm, rash, and skin infection. See Table 1. The incidence of adverse reactions between the 242 pediatric subjects (age 3 months to < 17 years) and 196 adult subjects (17 years or older) was similar (4% and 5%, respectively).

Subjects whose lesions cleared after 2 or 3 weeks of treatment continued to apply CUTIVATE® Lotion for an additional week. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 14%. These were local, cutaneous reactions and included dry skin (7%), stinging at application site (5%), and excoriation (2%). Additionally, a 4-month-old patient treated with CUTIVATE® Lotion had marked elevations of the hepatic enzymes AST and ALT. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] In another open label HPA axis suppression trial in which CUTIVATE® Lotion was also applied twice daily (rather than the indicated dosing regimen of once daily), 56 pediatric subjects (ages ≥3 months to 12 months), were enrolled [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. The adverse reactions included 2 cases of Herpes simplex at the application site (3.6%) and 3 cases of bacterial skin infections (5.4%). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following local adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CUTIVATE® Lotion: erythema, edema/swelling, and bleeding. The following systemic adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CUTIVATE® Cream and CUTIVATE® Ointment: immunosuppression/Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia; hyperglycemia/ glycosuria; Cushing syndrome; generalized body edema/blurred vision; and acute urticarial reaction (edema, urticaria, pruritus, and throat swelling). The following local adverse reactions have also been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings or higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions include: acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, skin atrophy, striae, hypertrichosis and miliaria. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression: Reversible HPA axis suppression and resulting glucocorticoid insufficiency can occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, use over large surface area, prolonged use, use under occlusion, concomitant use with other corticosteroid-containing products, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Minimize risk by mitigating the risk factors and use product as recommended. Modify use if HPA axis suppression is suspected. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) • Skin Irritation and Sensitization: CUTIVATE® Lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression and Other Adverse Endocrine Effects Topical corticosteroids, including CUTIVATE® Lotion, can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticoid insufficiency. Risk factors that predispose to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use under occlusion, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, and liver failure. Pediatric patients may be at greater risk of HPA axis suppression due to their higher skin surface area to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. HPA axis suppression may occur during or after withdrawal of treatment. If HPA axis suppression is suspected, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent topical corticosteroid. Evaluation of HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. The effects of CUTIVATE® Lotion on HPA axis function in pediatric patients were investigated in two trials. Among a total of 89 evaluable subjects from the two trials who were treated with CUTIVATE® Lotion twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks, a single subject with >90% body surface area treated showed laboratory evidence of transient suppression immediately post-treatment. The post cosyntropin stimulation test serum cortisol returned to a normal level (22.1µg/dL) within one week of the final treatment visit [see Use In Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions CUTIVATE® Lotion may cause local adverse reactions, including skin atrophy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. The risk is greater with use under occlusion and with higher potency products. CUTIVATE® Lotion contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product. Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin. Avoid using CUTIVATE® Lotion in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis. If irritation develops, discontinue CUTIVATE® Lotion and institute appropriate therapy. Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation can be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing. Discontinue CUTIVATE® Lotion if appropriate. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If skin infections are present or develop at the treatment site, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of CUTIVATE® Lotion until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience: In controlled clinical trials of twice-daily administration, the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of fluticasone propionate cream was approximately 4%. These adverse reactions were usually mild; self-limiting; and consisted primarily of pruritus, dryness, numbness of fingers, and burning. These events occurred in 2.9%, 1.2%, 1.0%, and 0.6% of patients, respectively. Two clinical studies compared once- to twice-daily administration of fluticasone propionate cream for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema. The local drug-related adverse events for the 491 patients enrolled in both studies are shown in Table 1. In the study enrolling both adult and pediatric patients, the incidence of local adverse events in the 119 pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years was comparable to the 140 patients ages 13 to 62 years. Fifty-one pediatric patients ages 3 months to 5 years, with moderate to severe eczema, were enrolled in an open-label HPA axis safety study. Fluticasone propionate cream was applied twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks over an arithmetic mean body surface area of 64% (range, 35% to 95%). The mean morning cortisol levels with standard deviations before treatment (prestimulation mean value = 13.76 ± 6.94 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 30.53 ± 7.23 mcg/dL) and at end treatment (prestimulation mean value = 12.32 ± 6.92 mcg/dL, poststimulation mean value = 28.84 ± 7.16 mcg/dL) showed little change. In 2 of 43 (4.7%) patients with end-treatment results, peak cortisol levels following cosyntropin stimulation testing were <18 µg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. Follow-up testing after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis. Local drug-related adverse events were transient burning, resolving the same day it was reported; transient urticaria, resolving the same day it was reported; erythematous rash; dusky erythema, resolving within 1 month after cessation of fluticasone propionate cream; and telangiectasia, resolving within 3 months after stopping fluticasone propionate cream.

Post Marketing Experience: Systemic adverse events with fluticasone propionate cream and fluticasone propionate ointment have included: immunosuppression/Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia; hyperglycemia/glycosuria; Cushing syndrome; generalized body edema/blurred vision; and acute urticarial reaction (edema, urticaria, pruritus, and throat swelling). The following localized adverse reactions have been reported during post approval use of fluticasone propionate cream: skin discoloration, erythema, irritation, edema/swelling, atrophy, contusion, dermatitis, pain, sepsis, hemorrhage, acneiform eruptions. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."
