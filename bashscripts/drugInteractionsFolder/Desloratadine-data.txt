        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] The most common adverse reactions (reported in >=2% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Virtus Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-848-3593 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2,834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1,655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by >=2% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1,655) Placebo (n=1,652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were (rates for Desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics: Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the CLARINEX group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of CLARINEX Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with CLARINEX Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by >=2% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving CLARINEX Tablets Adverse Event CLARINEX Tablets 5 mg (n=1655) Placebo (n=1652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in CLARINEX and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received CLARINEX Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received CLARINEX Tablets and that were more common with CLARINEX than placebo were (rates for CLARINEX and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received CLARINEX Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for CLARINEX and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving CLARINEX Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the CLARINEX product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving CLARINEX Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for CLARINEX and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving CLARINEX Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving CLARINEX Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular and central nervous system effects: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders. (5.1) Coexisting conditions: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism. (5.2) 5.1 Cardiovascular and Central Nervous System Effects The pseudoephedrine sulfate contained in CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets, like other sympathomimetic amines, can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects in some patients such as insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias. In addition, central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has been reported. Therefore, CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, and should not be used in patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease. 5.2 Coexisting Conditions CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets contain pseudoephedrine sulfate, a sympathomimetic amine, and therefore should be used with caution in patients with diabetes and hyperthyroidism. Also use with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or increased intraocular pressure, as urinary retention and narrow-angle glaucoma may occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Co-Administration with Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or within fourteen (14) days of stopping such treatment as an increase in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis, may occur [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have been reported after administration of desloratadine a component of CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should be stopped and alternative treatment should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Renal Impairment CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment CLARINEX-D 12 HOUR Extended Release Tablets should generally be avoided in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] The most common adverse reactions (reported in >= 2% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of desloratadine tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with desloratadine tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by >= 2% of Adult and Adolescent Allergic Rhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n = 1655) Placebo (n = 1652) Infections and Infestations 4.1% 2.0% Pharyngitis Nervous System Disorders 2.1% 1.8% Somnolence Gastrointestinal Disorders 3.0% 1.9% Dry Mouth Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders 2.1% 1.8% Myalgia Reproductive System and Breast Disorders 2.1% 1.6% Dysmenorrhea General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 2.1% 1.2% Fatigue The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received desloratadine tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received desloratadine tablets and that were more common with desloratadine than placebo were (rates for desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received desloratadine oral solution for 15 days in three placebo-controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving desloratadine oral solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, movement disorders (including dystonia, tics, and extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have been reported. In such cases, stop desloratadine at once and consider alternative treatments. (5.1) This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. (5.1) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis have been reported after administration of desloratadine. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with desloratadine should be stopped and alternative treatment should be considered. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hypersensitivity reactions. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] The most common adverse reactions (reported in >=2% of adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis and greater than placebo) were pharyngitis, dry mouth, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, dysmenorrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Belcher Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-727-471-0850 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2,834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1,655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Desloratadine group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo, are listed in Table 1. Table 1Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by >=2% of Adult and Adolescent AllergicRhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine Tablets Adverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg (n=1,655) Placebo (n=1,652) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4.1% 2.0% Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2.1% 1.8% Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.0% 1.9% Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2.1% 1.8% Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2.1% 1.6% General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2.1% 1.2% The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Desloratadine and placebo-treated patients. There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race. Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were (rates for Desloratadine and placebo, respectively): headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%), and myalgia (3%, 1%). Pediatrics Two hundred and forty-six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo controlled clinical trials. Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2.5 mg once a day, subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1.25 mg once a day, and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1.0 mg once a day. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age, no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects. In subjects 2 to 5 years of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (5.5%, 5.4%), urinary tract infection (3.6%, 0%) and varicella (3.6%, 0%). In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age, adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever (16.9%, 12.9%), diarrhea (15.4%, 11.3%), upper respiratory tract infections (10.8%, 9.7%), coughing (10.8%, 6.5%), appetite increased (3.1%, 1.6%), emotional lability (3.1%, 0%), epistaxis (3.1%, 0%), parasitic infection (3.1%, 0%), pharyngitis (3.1%, 0%), rash maculopapular (3.1%, 0%). In subjects 6 months to 11 months of age, adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (21.2%, 12.9%), diarrhea (19.7%, 8.1%), fever (12.1%, 1.6%), irritability (12.1%, 11.3%), coughing (10.6%, 9.7%), somnolence (9.1%, 8.1%), bronchitis (6.1%, 0%), otitis media (6.1%, 1.6%), vomiting (6.1%, 3.2%), anorexia (4.5%, 1.6%), pharyngitis (4.5%, 1.6%), insomnia (4.5%, 0%), rhinorrhea (4.5%, 3.2%), erythema (3.0%, 1.6%), and nausea (3.0%, 0%). There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter, including the QTc interval. Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: tachycardia, palpitations, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis), psychomotor hyperactivity, seizures, and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin, and very rarely, hepatitis."
