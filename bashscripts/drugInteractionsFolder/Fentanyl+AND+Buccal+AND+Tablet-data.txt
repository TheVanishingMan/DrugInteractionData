        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ABSTRAL is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors need to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dosage conservatively. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of ABSTRAL. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers need to be monitored for signs of increased ABSTRAL activity and the dose of ABSTRAL must be adjusted accordingly. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (total frequency ≥ 3%): nausea, somnolence, headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ProStrakan, Inc. at 1-888-227-8725 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ABSTRAL has been evaluated in 311 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Two hundred and seventy (270) of these patients were treated in multiple-dose studies. The duration of therapy for patients in multiple-dose studies ranged from 1-405 days with an average duration of 131 days and with 44 patients treated for at least 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABSTRAL include typical opioid adverse reactions, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of ABSTRAL were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing reactions among patients who received ABSTRAL for breakthrough pain along with concomitant opioid use for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ABSTRAL therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign ABSTRAL a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products) ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ABSTRAL, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe ABSTRAL must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive ABSTRAL, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mallinckrodt Inc., at 1-800-778-7898 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning – WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Full and partially consumed oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is NOT a generic version of Fentora® (fentanyl citrate buccal tablet). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals, who prescribe oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme system; therefore potential interactions may occur when FENTORA is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving FENTORA who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done cautiously [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of FENTORA. Patients receiving FENTORA who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased FENTORA activity and the dose of FENTORA should be adjusted accordingly. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions. (5.4, 7)"

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals, at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of FENTORA has been evaluated in 304 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with FENTORA are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly. The clinical trials of FENTORA were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received FENTORA for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of FENTORA therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 2 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Table 2.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Fentora is not bioequivalent to other fentanyl products. Do not convert from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis. (5.2) Use with other CNS depressants and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate FENTORA cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) Application site reactions occurred in 10% of patients in clinical trials and ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. (5.8) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in FENTORA. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing FENTORA is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products other than Actiq. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) For patients being converted from Actiq, it is necessary to follow the instructions found in Table 1 in Section 2.1,.as Actiq and FENTORA are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. FENTORA is NOT a generic version of Actiq. All patients should be titrated from the 100 mcg dose. The initial dose of FENTORA should be 100 mcg. Titrate each patient individually to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a FENTORA prescription for an Actiq prescription under any circumstances. FENTORA and Actiq are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of FENTORA compared to other fentanyl products including Actiq that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of the same dose of FENTORA for the same dose of Actiq or any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that FENTORA contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ] 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of FENTORA with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of FENTORA if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking FENTORA of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate FENTORA with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of FENTORA may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer FENTORA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Application Site Reactions In clinical trials, 10% of all patients exposed to FENTORA reported application site reactions. These reactions ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. Application site reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients were pain (4%), ulcer (3%), and irritation (3%). Application site reactions tended to occur early in treatment, were self-limited and only resulted in treatment discontinuation for 2% of patients. 5.9 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use FENTORA with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.10 MAO Inhibitors FENTORA is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.11 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] , FENTORA is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ABSTRAL is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors need to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dosage conservatively. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of ABSTRAL. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers need to be monitored for signs of increased ABSTRAL activity and the dose of ABSTRAL must be adjusted accordingly.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (total frequency ≥ 3%): nausea, somnolence, headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Galena Biopharma, Inc. at 1-888-227-8725 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ABSTRAL has been evaluated in 311 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Two hundred and seventy (270) of these patients were treated in multiple-dose studies. The duration of therapy for patients in multiple-dose studies ranged from 1-405 days with an average duration of 131 days and with 44 patients treated for at least 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABSTRAL include typical opioid adverse reactions, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of ABSTRAL were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 2 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing reactions among patients who received ABSTRAL for breakthrough pain along with concomitant opioid use for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ABSTRAL therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 2 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign ABSTRAL a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid- induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert on a mcg to mcg basis from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available except for Actiq [see Conversion from Actiq (2.2) ]. This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl. Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and longterm care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ABSTRAL, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe ABSTRAL must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive ABSTRAL, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a PatientPrescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."
