The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Two patients treated with NORITATE once daily discontinued treatment because of adverse events: one for a severe flare of comedonal acne and one for rosacea aggravated. Additional clinical adverse effects reported spontaneously since the drug was marketed are uncommon and include tingling or numbness of extremities, allergic reactions, skin and eye irritation, rash, headache, nausea and dry mouth."
