        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as: generalized skin erythema, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, rhinitis, wheezing, laryngeal edema, itching of nose and throat, breathlessness, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension and marked perspiration. Less commonly, nausea, emesis, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur. Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness and rarely death. The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex. Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria, associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent. (See Overdose section) Local Reactions consisting of erythema, itching, swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site. These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days. Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment. For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications may be dictated. Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to: MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, call 1-800-FDA-1088."
