        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure. For concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment may be needed (2.7, 5.10, 7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the co-administration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure (2.7, 5.10, 7.2) requiring dose adjustment: CIALIS for use as needed: no more than 10 mg every 72 hours CIALIS for once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha-blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha-blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: •Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). •Use of CIALIS with alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). •CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha-blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha-blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) •Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). •Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). CIALIS should be used with caution, and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks, in patients with a history of NAION. Patients with a \"crowded\" optic disc may also be at an increased risk of NAION (5.4, 6.2). •Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). •Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: •myocardial infarction within the last 90 days •unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse •New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months •uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension •stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Effects on the Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥50. An observational study evaluated whether recent use of PDE5 inhibitors, as a class, was associated with acute onset of NAION. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION within 5 half-lives of PDE5 inhibitor use. From this information, it is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with \"crowded\" optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population; however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, for this uncommon condition. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED •Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. •In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. •In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. •Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH •The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. •Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure. For concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment may be needed (2.7, 5.10, 7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the co-administration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure (7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Contraindications (4.1), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin or tamsulosin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1, 6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 6550 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 716, 389, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed In eight primary placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Event Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use In three placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse events were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies at 12 weeks (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 3% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Influenza 2% 3% 2% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Bronchitis 1% 2% 0% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse events were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis viral 2% 3% 5% Influenza 3% 5% 3% Back Pain 3% 5% 2% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal Congestion 0% 0% 4% Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 and 2. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbancy. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use are described in Table 2. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, events of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of 0.3%. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The list does not include adverse events that are reported from clinical trials and that are listed elsewhere in this section. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.6)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension (>170/100 mm Hg) stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1), (7.2), (7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.7 Renal Insufficiency CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with a moderate degree of renal insufficiency should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure. For concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment may be needed (2.7, 5.10, 7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the co-administration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure (2.7, 5.10, 7.2) requiring dose adjustment: CIALIS for use as needed: no more than 10 mg every 72 hours CIALIS for once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across placebo-controlled studies with CIALIS for use as needed for ED, diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 years of age and older who were treated with CIALIS (2.5% of patients) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain, peripheral edema Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha-blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha-blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). CIALIS should be used with caution, and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks, in patients with a history of NAION. Patients with a \"crowded\" optic disc may also be at an increased risk of NAION (5.4, 6.2). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Effects on the Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥50. An observational study evaluated whether recent use of PDE5 inhibitors, as a class, was associated with acute onset of NAION. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION within 5 half-lives of PDE5 inhibitor use. From this information, it is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with \"crowded\" optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population; however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, for this uncommon condition. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure. For concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment may be needed (2.7, 5.10, 7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the co-administration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure. For concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, dose adjustment may be needed (2.7, 5.10, 7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha-Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, tamsulosin or alfuzosin. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed for ED a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies of 12 weeks Treatment Duration (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 4% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Clinical Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis 2% 3% 5% Back pain 3% 5% 2% Upper respiratory tract infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal reflux disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal congestion 0% 0% 4% CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and for ED and BPH In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks duration, two in patients with BPH and one in patients with ED and BPH, the mean age was 63 years (range 44 to 93) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 3.6% compared to 1.6% in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥1% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for CIALIS for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Renal and Urinary — renal impairment Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). CIALIS is not recommended in combination with alpha blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when CIALIS is used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha blockers. (2.7, 5.6, 7.1, 12.2) If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.14). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: ED Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. BPH The efficacy of the co-administration of an alpha-blocker and CIALIS for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of CIALIS and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [See Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting CIALIS for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 5.7 Renal Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 – 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with CIALIS for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure (7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Contraindications (4.1), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin or tamsulosin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1, 6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 6550 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 716, 389, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed In eight primary placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Event Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use In three placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse events were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies at 12 weeks (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 3% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Influenza 2% 3% 2% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Bronchitis 1% 2% 0% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse events were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis viral 2% 3% 5% Influenza 3% 5% 3% Back Pain 3% 5% 2% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal Congestion 0% 0% 4% Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 and 2. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbancy. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use are described in Table 2. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, events of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of 0.3%. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The list does not include adverse events that are reported from clinical trials and that are listed elsewhere in this section. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.6)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension (>170/100 mm Hg) stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1), (7.2), (7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.7 Renal Insufficiency CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with a moderate degree of renal insufficiency should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take CIALIS with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CIALIS can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, antihypertensives or alcohol (7.1). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) increase CIALIS exposure (7.2). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) decrease CIALIS exposure (7.2). 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with CIALIS Nitrates — Administration of CIALIS to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In clinical pharmacology studies, CIALIS was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see Contraindications (4.1), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alpha Blockers — Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin or tamsulosin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives — PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendrofluazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol — Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CIALIS [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Antacids — Simultaneous administration of an antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) and tadalafil reduced the apparent rate of absorption of tadalafil without altering exposure (AUC) to tadalafil. H 2 Antagonists (e.g. Nizatidine) — An increase in gastric pH resulting from administration of nizatidine had no significant effect on pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors — CIALIS is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Ketoconazole) — Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased tadalafil 20 mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 312% and Cmax by 22%, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ketoconazole (200 mg daily) increased tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 107% and Cmax by 15%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice, would likely increase tadalafil exposure. HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (500 mg or 600 mg twice daily at steady state), an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 32% with a 30% reduction in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Ritonavir (200 mg twice daily), increased tadalafil 20-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 124% with no change in Cmax, relative to the values for tadalafil 20 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other HIV protease inhibitors would likely increase tadalafil exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Cytochrome P450 Inducers — Studies have shown that drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease tadalafil exposure. CYP3A4 (e.g., Rifampin) — Rifampin (600 mg daily), a CYP3A4 inducer, reduced tadalafil 10-mg single-dose exposure (AUC) by 88% and Cmax by 46%, relative to the values for tadalafil 10 mg alone. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, would likely decrease tadalafil exposure. No dose adjustment is warranted. The reduced exposure of tadalafil with the coadministration of rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of CIALIS for once daily use; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. 7.3 Potential for CIALIS to Affect Other Drugs Aspirin — Tadalafil did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin. Cytochrome P450 Substrates — CIALIS is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. Studies have shown that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. CYP1A2 (e.g. Theophylline) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. When tadalafil was administered to subjects taking theophylline, a small augmentation (3 beats per minute) of the increase in heart rate associated with theophylline was observed. CYP2C9 (e.g. Warfarin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or R-warfarin, nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin. CYP3A4 (e.g. Midazolam or Lovastatin) — Tadalafil had no significant effect on exposure (AUC) to midazolam or lovastatin. P-glycoprotein (e.g. Digoxin) — Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once per day) for 10 days did not have a significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg/day) in healthy subjects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥2%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb (6.1, 6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tadalafil was administered to over 6550 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of CIALIS for once daily use, a total of 716, 389, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For CIALIS for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CIALIS for Use as Needed In eight primary placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported (see Table 1) for CIALIS for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Use as Needed a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Adverse Event Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushinga 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% CIALIS for Once Daily Use In three placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients. The following adverse events were reported (see Table 2) in clinical trials of 12 weeks duration: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Three Primary Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Studies at 12 weeks (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=248) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=196) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=304) Headache 5% 3% 6% Dyspepsia 2% 3% 5% Nasopharyngitis 4% 4% 3% Back pain 1% 3% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 1% 3% 3% Flushing 1% 1% 3% Influenza 2% 3% 2% Myalgia 1% 2% 2% Cough 0% 4% 2% Diarrhea 0% 1% 2% Nasal congestion 0% 2% 2% Pain in extremity 0% 1% 2% Bronchitis 1% 2% 0% Urinary tract infection 0% 2% 0% Gastroesophageal reflux 0% 2% 1% Abdominal pain 0% 2% 1% The following adverse events were reported (see Table 3) over 24 weeks treatment duration in one placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study: Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with CIALIS for Once Daily Use (2.5 or 5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in One Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of 24 Weeks Treatment Duration for CIALIS for Once Daily Use Adverse Event Placebo (N=94) Tadalafil 2.5 mg (N=96) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=97) Nasopharyngitis 5% 6% 6% Gastroenteritis viral 2% 3% 5% Influenza 3% 5% 3% Back Pain 3% 5% 2% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 0% 3% 4% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 1% Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 0% 3% 2% Myalgia 2% 4% 1% Hypertension 0% 1% 3% Nasal Congestion 0% 0% 4% Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 and 2. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbancy. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with CIALIS for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for CIALIS for once daily use are described in Table 2. In studies of CIALIS for once daily use, events of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of 0.3%. Across all studies with any CIALIS dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of CIALIS for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to CIALIS is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a whole — asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain Cardiovascular — angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Digestive — abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting Musculoskeletal — arthralgia, neck pain Nervous — dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Respiratory — dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Skin and Appendages — pruritus, rash, sweating Ophthalmologic — blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Otologic — sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Urogenital — erection increased, spontaneous penile erection 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CIALIS. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The list does not include adverse events that are reported from clinical trials and that are listed elsewhere in this section. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of CIALIS without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of CIALIS and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to CIALIS, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a whole — hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, retinal artery occlusion Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including CIALIS. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors, to the patient's underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.6)]. Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of CIALIS, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7)]. Urogenital — priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing CIALIS, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use CIALIS if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status (5.1). Use of CIALIS with alpha blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (≥5 units) may lead to hypotension (5.6, 5.9). If taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, dose should be adjusted: CIALIS for use as needed: ≤10 mg every 72 hours. For once daily use: dose not to exceed 2.5 mg (5.10). Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use CIALIS with caution in patients predisposed to priapism (5.3). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). Discuss increased risk of NAION in patients with history of NAION (5.4). Patients should stop CIALIS and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of CIALIS. In such a patient, who has taken CIALIS, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of CIALIS before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking CIALIS should seek immediate medical attention. [See Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for CIALIS, and therefore until further information is available, CIALIS is not recommended for the following groups of patients: myocardial infarction within the last 90 days unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension (>170/100 mm Hg) stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing CIALIS, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking CIALIS for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that CIALIS for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7.1), (7.2), (7.3)]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. CIALIS should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.4 Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. 5.6 Alpha blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for CIALIS to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including CIALIS, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.7 Renal Insufficiency CIALIS for Use as Needed CIALIS should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with severe renal insufficiency or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of CIALIS in patients with a moderate degree of renal insufficiency should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, CIALIS for once daily use is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment CIALIS for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. CIALIS for Once Daily Use CIALIS for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. Therefore, caution is advised if CIALIS for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of CIALIS in this group is not recommended [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and CIALIS, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with CIALIS can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) CIALIS is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of CIALIS should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CIALIS for once daily use, the dose of CIALIS should not exceed 2.5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of CIALIS and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. CIALIS has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although CIALIS has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of CIALIS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with ADCIRCA Nitrates Do not use ADCIRCA in patients who are using any form of organic nitrate [see Contraindications (4.1)]. In clinical pharmacology studies ADCIRCA potentiated the hypotensive effect of nitrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a patient who has taken ADCIRCA, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life–threatening situation, at least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of ADCIRCA before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Alpha-Blockers PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA, and alpha–adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, alfuzosin or tamsulosin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Antihypertensives PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood–pressure–lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendroflumethiazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alcohol Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood pressure–lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with ADCIRCA can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg) did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect ADCIRCA Ritonavir Ritonavir initially inhibits and later induces CYP3A, the enzyme involved in the metabolism of tadalafil. At steady state of ritonavir (about 1 week), the exposure to tadalafil is similar as in the absence of ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Other Potent Inhibitors of CYP3A Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A in the liver. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A such as ketoconazole, and itraconazole, avoid use of ADCIRCA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Potent Inducers of CYP3A For patients chronically taking potent inducers of CYP3A, such as rifampin, avoid use of ADCIRCA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Potential for ADCIRCA to Affect Other Drugs Cytochrome P450 Substrates Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g., theophylline, warfarin, midazolam, lovastatin, bosentan) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Aspirin Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg once daily) does not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. P-glycoprotein (e.g., digoxin) Coadministration of tadalafil (40 mg once daily) for 10 days did not significantly alter digoxin pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Tadalafil was administered to 398 patients with PAH during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of ADCIRCA, a total of 311 and 251 subjects have been treated for at least 182 days and 360 days, respectively. The overall rates of discontinuation because of an adverse event (AE) in the placebo-controlled trial were 9% for ADCIRCA 40 mg and 15% for placebo. The rates of discontinuation because of AEs, other than those related to worsening of PAH, in patients treated with ADCIRCA 40 mg was 4% compared to 5% in placebo-treated patients. In the placebo-controlled study, the most common AEs were generally transient and mild to moderate in intensity. Table 1 presents treatment-emergent adverse events reported by ≥9% of patients in the ADCIRCA 40 mg group and occurring more frequently than with placebo. TABLE 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by ≥9% of Patients in ADCIRCA and More Frequent than Placebo by 2% EVENT Placebo (%) (N=82) ADCIRCA 20 mg (%) (N=82) ADCIRCA 40 mg (%) (N=79) Headache 15 32 42 Myalgia 4 9 14 Nasopharyngitis 7 2 13 Flushing 2 6 13 Respiratory Tract Infection (Upper and Lower) 6 7 13 Pain in Extremity 2 5 11 Nausea 6 10 11 Back Pain 6 12 10 Dyspepsia 2 13 10 Nasal Congestion (Including sinus congestion) 1 0 9 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tadalafil. These events have been chosen for inclusion either because of their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The list does not include adverse events that are reported from clinical trials and that are listed elsewhere in this section. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular — Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of tadalafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of tadalafil and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to tadalafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a whole — Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis Nervous — Migraine, seizure and seizure recurrence, and transient global amnesia Ophthalmologic — Visual field defect, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal artery occlusion Otologic — Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of tadalafil, to the patient's underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Urogenital — Priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular effects: Carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, impaired autonomic control of blood pressure, aortic stenosis) could be adversely affected by vasodilatory effects of ADCIRCA. Not recommended in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. (5.1) Concomitant alpha-blockers or alcohol: Note additive blood pressure-lowering effects. (5.1) Use with Ritonavir: Requires dosage adjustment. (2.3, 5.2) Other concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitors: Avoid use with ADCIRCA. (5.2) Potent Inducers of CYP3A: Avoid use of ADCIRCA in patients chronically taking potent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin). (5.2, 7.2) Effects on the eye: Patients should seek immediate medical attention if sudden loss of vision occurs, which could be a sign of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). (5.5) Hearing impairment: Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if sudden decrease or loss of hearing occurs. (5.6) Concomitant PDE5 inhibitors: Avoid use with CIALIS or other PDE5 inhibitors. (5.7) Prolonged erection: Advise patients to seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. (5.8) 5.1 Cardiovascular Effects Discuss with patients the appropriate action to take in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of ADCIRCA. At least 48 hours should elapse after the last dose of ADCIRCA before taking nitrates. If a patient has taken ADCIRCA within 48 hours, administer nitrates under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking ADCIRCA should seek immediate medical attention. PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, have mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. Prior to prescribing ADCIRCA, carefully consider whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure or with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Since there are no clinical data on administration of ADCIRCA to patients with veno-occlusive disease, administration of ADCIRCA to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when ADCIRCA is administered, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered. There is a lack of data on safety and efficacy in the following groups who were specifically excluded from the PAH clinical trials: Patients with clinically significant aortic and mitral valve disease Patients with pericardial constriction Patients with restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy Patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction Patients with life-threatening arrhythmias Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease Patients with hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg) or uncontrolled hypertension Use with Alpha Blockers and Antihypertensives PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA, and alpha–adrenergic blocking agents are vasodilators with blood pressure–lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and use of other antihypertensive drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Use with Alcohol Both alcohol and tadalafil are mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood pressure-lowering effects are increased [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.2 Use with Potent CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers Co-administration of ADCIRCA in Patients on Ritonavir In patients receiving ritonavir for at least one week, start ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of Ritonavir in Patients on ADCIRCA Avoid use of ADCIRCA during the initiation of ritonavir. Stop ADCIRCA at least 24 hours prior to starting ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of ritonavir, resume ADCIRCA at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Other Potent Inhibitors of CYP3A Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A in the liver. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, avoid use of ADCIRCA [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Potent Inducers of CYP3A For patients chronically taking potent inducers of CYP3A, such as rifampin, avoid use of ADCIRCA [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Use in Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment Start dosing at 20 mg once daily. Increase the dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with severe renal impairment Avoid use of ADCIRCA because of increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Use in Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) Because of limited clinical experience in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis, consider a starting dose of 20 mg once daily ADCIRCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) Patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis have not been studied. Avoid use of ADCIRCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Visual Loss Physicians should advise patients to seek immediate medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (\"crowded disc\"), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥50 in the general population. An observational study evaluated whether recent episodic use of PDE5 inhibitors, as a class, typical of erectile dysfunction treatment, was associated with acute onset of NAION. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION within 1 to 4 days of PDE5 inhibitor use. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or other factors. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye, including whether such individuals could be adversely affected by use of vasodilators such as PDE5 inhibitors. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.6 Hearing Impairment Physicians should advise patients to seek immediate medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Combination with Other PDE5 Inhibitors Tadalafil is also marketed as CIALIS. The safety and efficacy of taking ADCIRCA together with CIALIS or other PDE5 inhibitors have not been studied. Inform patients taking ADCIRCA not to take CIALIS or other PDE5 inhibitors. 5.8 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. ADCIRCA should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). 5.9 Effects on Bleeding PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. ADCIRCA has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although ADCIRCA has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment."
