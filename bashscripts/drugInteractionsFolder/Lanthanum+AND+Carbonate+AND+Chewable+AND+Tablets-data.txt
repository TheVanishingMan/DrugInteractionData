        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lanthanum in FOSRENOL has the potential to bind to drugs with anionic (e.g., carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl) groups. FOSRENOL may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism. There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between FOSRENOL and most concomitant drugs. When administering an oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, administer the drug at least one hour before or three hours after FOSRENOL. Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range. There is a potential for FOSRENOL to interact with compounds which bind to cationic antacids (i.e. aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium-based). Therefore, do not take such compounds within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. ( 7.1 ) Oral quinolone antibiotics must be taken at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after FOSRENOL. ( 7.2 ) Do not take thyroid hormone replacement therapy within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. Monitoring of TSH levels is recommended in patients receiving both medicinal agents. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Drugs Binding to Antacids There is a potential for FOSRENOL to interact with compounds which bind to cationic antacids (i.e. aluminium-, magnesium-, or calcium-based). Therefore, do not administer such compounds within 2 hours of dosing with FOSRENOL. Examples of relevant classes of compounds where antacids have been demonstrated to reduce bioavailability include antibiotics (such as quinolones, ampicillin and tetracyclines), thyroid hormones, ACE-inhibitors, statin lipid regulators and anti-malarials. 7.2 Quinolone Antibiotics Co-administration of FOSRENOL with quinolone antibiotics may reduce the extent of their absorption. The bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin was decreased by approximately 50% when taken with FOSRENOL in a single dose study in healthy volunteers. Administer oral quinolone antibiotics at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after FOSRENOL. When oral quinolones are given for short courses, consider eliminating the doses of FOSRENOL that would be normally scheduled near the time of quinolone intake to improve quinolone absorption [ see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ]. 7.3 Levothyroxine The bioavailability of levothyroxine was decreased by approximately 40% when taken together with FOSRENOL. Administer thyroid hormone replacement therapy at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after dosing with FOSRENOL and monitor thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [ see Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Overall, the safety profile of FOSRENOL has been studied in over 5200 subjects in completed clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions for FOSRENOL were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea and vomiting and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. The most common reactions included: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia and tooth injury. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shire US Inc. at 1-800-828-2088 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where a total of 180 and 95 ESRD patients were randomized to FOSRENOL and placebo, respectively, for 4-6 weeks of treatment, the most common reactions that were more frequent (>5% difference) in the FOSRENOL group were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Table 1).

The safety of FOSRENOL was studied in two long-term, open-labeled clinical trials, which included 1215 patients treated with FOSRENOL and 944 with alternative therapy. Fourteen percent (14%) of FOSRENOL treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were the most common types of event leading to discontinuation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia, and tooth injury."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, and fecal impaction have been associated with lanthanum use, some requiring surgery or hospitalization. Risk factors include constipation and altered gastrointestinal anatomy. ( 2 , 5.1 ) FOSRENOL has radio-opaque properties and therefore may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects There have been reports of serious cases of gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, and fecal impaction reported in association with lanthanum, some requiring surgery or hospitalization. Risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction identified from post-marketing reports include alteration in gastrointestinal anatomy (e.g., history of gastrointestinal surgery, colon cancer), hypomotility disorders (e.g., constipation, ileus, diabetes) and concomitant medications (e.g., calcium channel blockers). Some cases were reported in patients with no history of gastrointestinal disease. Advise patients to chew the tablet thoroughly to reduce the risk of adverse gastrointestinal events. Patients with acute peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or bowel obstruction were not included in FOSRENOL clinical studies [ See Contraindications (4) ]. 5.2 Diagnostic Tests FOSRENOL has radio-opaque properties and therefore may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures."

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between FOSRENOL and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product.

In pooled active comparator controlled clinical trials, hypocalcemia was noted with an incidence of approximately 5% in both lanthanum and active comparator groups. A nonclinical study and a phase 1 study have shown reduced absorption of calcium in the intestine with lanthanum carbonate treatment. In a crossover study in 72 healthy individuals comparing Fosrenol chewable tablets to Fosrenol oral powder, gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were more common for the oral powder formulation (18%) than for the chewable tablets (7%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet."
