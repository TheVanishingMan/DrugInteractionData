        "Drug Interactions Although a causal relationship has not been established, there have been reports of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patients treated with pentoxifylline with and without anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors. Patients on warfarin should have more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times, while patients with other risk factors complicated by hemorrhage (e.g., recent surgery, peptic ulceration) should have periodic examinations for bleeding including hematocrit and/or hemoglobin. Concomitant administration of pentoxifylline and theophylline-containing drugs leads to increased theophylline levels and theophylline toxicity in some individuals. Such patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity and have their theophylline dosage adjusted as necessary. Concomitant administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (including e.g., ciprofloxacin or fluvoxamine) may increase the exposure to pentoxifylline (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Pentoxifylline has been used concurrently with antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics, and antiarrhythmics, without observed problems. Small decreases in blood pressure have been observed in some patients treated with pentoxifylline; periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy. If indicated, dosage of the antihypertensive agents should be reduced. Postmarketing cases of increased anticoagulant activity have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with pentoxifylline and vitamin K antagonists. Monitoring of anticoagulant activity in these patients is recommended when pentoxifylline is introduced or the dose is changed."

        "Drug Interactions Although a causal relationship has not been established, there have been reports of bleeding and/or prolonged prothrombin time in patients treated with pentoxifylline with and without anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors. Patients on Warfarin should have more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times, while patients with other risk factors complicated by hemorrhage (e.g., recent surgery, peptic ulceration) should have periodic examination for bleeding including hematocrit and/or hemoglobin. Concomitant administration of pentoxifylline and theophylline-containing drugs leads to increased theophylline levels and theophylline toxicity in some individuals. Such patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity and have their theophylline dosage adjusted as necessary. Pentoxifylline has been used concurrently with antihypertensive drugs, beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics, antidiabetic agents, and antiarrhythmics, without observed problems. Small decreases in blood pressure have been observed in some patients treated with pentoxifylline; periodic systemic blood pressure monitoring is recommended for patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive therapy. If indicated, dosage of the antihypertensive agents should be reduced."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials were conducted using either extended-release pentoxifylline tablets for up to 60 weeks or immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules for up to 24 weeks. Dosage ranges in the tablet studies were 400 mg bid to tid and in the capsule studies, 200 to 400 mg tid. The table summarizes the incidence (in percent) of adverse reactions considered drug related, as well as the numbers of patients who received extended-release pentoxifylline tablets, immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules, or the corresponding placebos. The incidence of adverse reactions was higher in the capsule studies (where dose related increases were seen in digestive and nervous system side effects) than in the tablet studies. Studies with the capsule include domestic experience, whereas studies with the extended-release tablets were conducted outside the U.S. The table indicates that in the tablet studies few patients discontinued because of adverse effects.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials were conducted using either extended-release pentoxifylline tablets for up to 60 weeks or immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules for up to 24 weeks. Dosage ranges in the tablet studies were 400 mg bid to tid and in the capsule studies, 200 to 400 mg tid. The table summarizes the incidence (in percent) of adverse reactions considered drug related, as well as the numbers of patients who received extended-release pentoxifylline tablets, immediate-release pentoxifylline capsules, or the corresponding placebos. The incidence of adverse reactions was higher in the capsule studies (where dose related increases were seen in digestive and nervous system side effects) than in the tablet studies. Studies with the capsule include domestic experience, whereas studies with the extended-release tablets were conducted outside the U.S. The table indicates that in the tablet studies few patients discontinued because of adverse effects. INCIDENCE (%) OF SIDE EFFECTS Extended-Release Immediate Tablets USP Release Capsules Commercially Available Used Only For Controlled Clinical Trials Pentoxifylline Placebo Pentoxifylline Placebo (Number of Patients at Risk) (321) (128) (177) (138) Discontinued for Side Effect 3.21 0 9.6 7.2 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Angina/Chest Pain 0.3 - 1.1 2.2 Arrhythmia/Palpitation - - 1.7 0.7 Flushing - - 2.3 0.7 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Abdominal Discomfort - - 4.0 1.4 Belching/Flatus/Bloating 0.6 - 9.0 3.6 Diarrhea - - 3.4 2.9 Dyspepsia 2.8 4.7 9.6 2.9 Nausea 2.2 0.8 28.8 8.7 Vomiting 1.2 - 4.5 0.7 NERVOUS SYSTEM Agitation/Nervousness - - 1.7 0.7 Dizziness 1.9 3.1 11.9 4.3 Drowsiness - - 1.1 5.8 Headache 1.2 1.6 6.2 5.8 Insomnia - - 2.3 2.2 Tremor 0.3 0.8 - - Blurred Vision - - 2.3 1.4 Pentoxifylline has been marketed in Europe and elsewhere since 1972. In addition to the above symptoms, the following have been reported spontaneously since marketing or occurred in other clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1%; the causal relationship was uncertain: Cardiovascular - dyspnea, edema, hypotension. Digestive - anorexia, cholecystitis, constipation, dry mouth/thirst. Nervous - anxiety, confusion, depression, seizures, aseptic meningitis. Respiratory - epistaxis, flu-like symptoms, laryngitis, nasal congestion. Skin and Appendages - brittle fingernails, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema. Special Senses - blurred vision, conjunctivitis, earache, scotoma. Miscellaneous - bad taste, excessive salivation, leukopenia, malaise, sore throat/swollen neck glands, weight change. A few rare events have been reported spontaneously worldwide since marketing in 1972. Although they occurred under circumstances in which a causal relationship with pentoxifylline could not be established, they are listed to serve as information for physicians. Cardiovascular - angina, arrhythmia, tachycardia, anaphylactoid reactions. Digestive - hepatitis, jaundice, increased liver enzymes; and Hemic and Lymphatic - decreased serum fibrinogen, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, leukemia, purpura, thrombocytopenia."
