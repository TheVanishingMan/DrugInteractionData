        "Drug Interactions Antacids The extent of absorption of cefaclor extended-release tablets is diminished if magnesium or aluminum hydroxide-containing antacids are taken within 1 hour of administration; H2 blockers do not alter either the rate or the extent of absorption of cefaclor extended-release tablets. Probenecid The renal excretion of cefaclor is inhibited by probenecid. Warfarin There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time with or without clinical bleeding in patients receiving cefaclor and warfarin concomitantly. No specific studies have been performed to rule in or rule out this potential drug/drug interaction."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials There were 3272 patients treated with multiple doses of cefaclor extended-release tablets in controlled clinical trials and an additional 211 subjects in pharmacology studies. There were no deaths in these trials thought to be related to toxicity from cefaclor extended-release tablets. Treatment was discontinued in 1.7% of patients due to adverse events thought to be possibly or probably drug-related. The following adverse clinical and laboratory events were reported during the cefaclor extended-release tablets clinical trials conducted in North America at doses of 375 mg or 500 mg BID; however, relatedness of the adverse events to the drug was not assigned by clinical investigators during the trials (see TABLES 4 and 5). Table 4: ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS - CEFACLOR EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS MULTIPLE DOSE DOSING REGIMENS CLINICAL TRIALS - NORTH AMERICA (n = 1400) Incidence Equal to or Greater Than 1% Event Incidence Headache 4.9% Rhinitis 3.9% Diarrhea 3.8% Nausea 3.4% Vaginitisn = 934 for these events (subset of female participants). 2.4% Vaginal Moniliasis 2.2% Abdominal Pain 1.6% Cough Increased 1.5% Pharyngitis 1.4% Pruritus 1.4% Back Pain 1.0% Adverse reactions occurring during the clinical trials with cefaclor extended-release tablets with an incidence of less than 1% but greater than 0.1% included the following (listed alphabetically): Accidental injury, anorexia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, chills, congestive heart failure, conjunctivitis, constipation, dizziness, dysmenorrhea, dyspepsia, dysuria, ear pain, edema, fever, flatulence, flu syndrome, gastritis, infection, insomnia, leukorrhea, lung disorder, maculopapular rash, malaise, menstrual disorder, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, neck pain, nervousness, nocturia, otitis media, pain, palpitation, peripheral edema, rash, respiratory disorder, sinusitis, somnolence, surgical procedure, sweating, tremor, urticaria, vomiting. NOTE: One case of serum-sickness-like reaction was reported among the 3272 adult patients treated with cefaclor extended-release tablets during the controlled clinical trials. These reactions have also been reported with the use of cefaclor in other oral formulations and are seen more frequently in pediatric patients than in adults. These reactions are characterized by findings of erythema multiforme, rash, and other skin manifestations accompanied by arthritis/arthralgia, with or without fever, and differ from classic serum sickness in that there is infrequently associated lymphadenopathy and proteinuria, no circulating immune complexes and no evidence to date of sequelae of the reaction. While further investigation is ongoing, serum-sickness-like reactions appear to be due to hypersensitivity and more often occur during or following a second (or subsequent) course of therapy with cefaclor. Such reactions have been reported with overall occurrence ranging from 1 in 200 (0.5%) in one focused trial; to 2 in 8346 (0.024%) in overall clinical trials (with an incidence in pediatric patients in clinical trials of 0.055%); to 1 in 38,000 (0.003%) in spontaneous event reports. Signs and symptoms usually occur a few days after initiation of therapy and subside within a few days after cessation of therapy. Occasionally these reactions have resulted in hospitalization, usually of short duration (median hospitalization = 2 to 3 days, based on postmarketing surveillance studies). In those patients requiring hospitalization, the symptoms have ranged from mild to severe at the time of admission with more of the severe reactions occurring in pediatric patients.

Other Adverse Reactions Associated With Other Formulations of Cefaclor In addition to the above, the following other adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been associated with cefaclor in other oral formulations: Clinical Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. Anaphylactoid events may be manifested by solitary symptoms, including angioedema, edema (including face and limbs), paresthesias, syncope, or vasodilatation. Anaphylaxis may be more common in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Rarely, hypersensitivity symptoms may persist for several months. Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis may appear either during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.) Laboratory Abnormal urinalysis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, transient elevations in AST, and transient thrombocytopenia have been reported. Cephalosporin-Class Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: Clinical Confusion, erythema multiforme, genital pruritus, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, hemolytic anemia, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, and reversible interstitial nephritis. Laboratory Positive direct Coombs’ test."

Causal Relationship Uncertain – CNS ─ Rarely, reversible hyperactivity, agitation, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, hypertonia, dizziness, hallucinations, and somnolence have been reported. Transitory abnormalities in clinical laboratory test results have been reported. Although they were of uncertain etiology, they are listed below to serve as alerting information for the physician. Hepatic ─ Slight elevations of AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase values (1 in 40). Hematopoietic ─ As has also been reported with other β-lactam antibiotics, transient lymphocytosis, leukopenia, and, rarely, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and reversible neutropenia of possible clinical significance.

Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefaclor, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, false positive test for urinary glucose, elevated bilirubin, elevated LDH, and pancytopenia. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE sections)."

Pruritus, urticaria, and positive Coombs’ tests each occur in less than 1 in 200 patients. Cases of serum-sickness-like reactions have been reported with the use of cefaclor. These are characterized by findings of erythema multiforme, rashes, and other skin manifestations accompanied by arthritis/arthralgia, with or without fever, and differ from classic serum sickness in that there is infrequently associated lymphadenopathy and proteinuria, no circulating immune complexes, and no evidence to date of sequelae of the reaction. Occasionally, solitary symptoms may occur, but do not represent a serum-sickness-like reaction. While further investigation is ongoing, serum-sickness-like reactions appear to be due to hypersensitivity and more often occur during or following a second (or subsequent) course of therapy with cefaclor. Such reactions have been reported more frequently in children than in adults with an overall occurrence ranging from 1 in 200 (0.5%) in one focused trial to 2 in 8,346 (0.024%) in overall clinical trials (with an incidence in children in clinical trials of 0.055%) to 1 in 38,000 (0.003%) in spontaneous event reports. Signs and symptoms usually occur a few days after initiation of therapy and subside within a few days after cessation of therapy; occasionally these reactions have resulted in hospitalization, usually of short duration (median hospitalization = 2 to 3 days, based on postmarketing surveillance studies). In those requiring hospitalization, the symptoms have ranged from mild to severe at the time of admission with more of the severe reactions occurring in children. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids appear to enhance resolution of the signs and symptoms. No serious sequelae have been reported. More severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely. Anaphylactoid events may be manifested by solitary symptoms, including angioedema, asthenia, edema(including face and limbs), dyspnea, paresthesias, syncope, hypotension, or vasodilatation. Anaphylaxis may be more common in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. Rarely, hypersensitivity symptoms may persist for several months. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in about 2.5% of patients and include diarrhea (1 in 70). Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS). Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. As with some penicillins and some other cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Other effects considered related to therapy included eosinophilia (1 in 50 patients), genital pruritus or vaginitis (less than 1 in 100 patients), and, rarely, thrombocytopenia or reversible interstitial nephritis. Causal Relationship Uncertain– CNS–Rarely, reversible hyperactivity, agitation, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, hypertonia, dizziness, hallucinations, and somnolence have been reported. Transitory abnormalities in clinical laboratory test results have been reported. Although they were of uncertain etiology, they are listed below to serve as alerting information for the physician. Hepatic–Slight elevations of AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase values (1 in 40). Hematopoietic–As has also been reported with other β-lactam antibiotics, transient lymphocytosis, leukopenia, and, rarely, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and reversible neutropenia of possible clinical significance. There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time with or without clinical bleeding in patients receiving cefaclor and Coumadin® concomitantly. Renal– Slight elevations in BUN or serum creatinine (less than 1 in 500) or abnormal urinalysis (less than 1 in 200). Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefaclor, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, false positive test for urinary glucose, elevated bilirubin, elevated LDH, and pancytopenia. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE sections).",

Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. As with some penicillins and some other cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Other effects considered related to therapy included eosinophilia (1 in 50 patients), genital pruritus or vaginitis (less than 1 in 100 patients), and, rarely, thrombocytopenia or reversible interstitial nephritis. Causal Relationship Uncertain– CNS–Rarely, reversible hyperactivity, agitation, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, hypertonia, dizziness, hallucinations, and somnolence have been reported. Transitory abnormalities in clinical laboratory test results have been reported. Although they were of uncertain etiology, they are listed below to serve as alerting information for the physician. Hepatic–Slight elevations of AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase values (1 in 40). Hematopoietic–As has also been reported with other β-lactam antibiotics, transient lymphocytosis, leukopenia, and, rarely, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and reversible neutropenia of possible clinical significance. There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time with or without clinical bleeding in patients receiving cefaclor and Coumadin® concomitantly. Renal– Slight elevations in BUN or serum creatinine (less than 1 in 500) or abnormal urinalysis (less than 1 in 200). Cephalosporin-class Adverse ReactionsIn addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefaclor, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, false positive test for urinary glucose, elevated bilirubin, elevated LDH, and pancytopenia. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE sections)."
