        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Severe chest pain, vasovagal and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Vasovagal and hypersensitivity reactions on rare occasions can be severe. These reactions may include syncope, sweating, dizziness, rash, dyspnea, flushing and changes in blood pressure and heart rate. General symptoms can include headache, malaise, urticaria, and pruritus. The most frequently reported adverse events to Visudyne(R) (verteporfin for injection) are injection site reactions (including pain, edema, inflammation, extravasation, rashes, hemorrhage and discoloration) and visual disturbances (including blurred vision, flashes of light, decreased visual acuity and visual field defects, including scotoma). These events occurred in approximately 10%-30% of patients. The following events, listed by Body System, were reported more frequently with Visudyne therapy than with placebo therapy and occurred in 1%-10% of patients: Ocular Treatment Site: Blepharitis, cataracts, conjunctivitis/conjunctival injection, dry eyes, ocular itching, severe vision decrease with or without subretinal/retinal or vitreous hemorrhage Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fever, flu syndrome, infusion related pain primarily presenting as back pain, photosensitivity reactions Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, peripheral vascular disorder, varicose veins Dermatologic: Eczema Digestive: Constipation, gastrointestinal cancers, nausea Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia, white blood cell count decreased, white blood cell count increased Hepatic: Elevated liver function tests Metabolic/Nutritional: Albuminuria, creatinine increased Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, arthrosis, myasthenia Nervous System: Hypesthesia, sleep disorder, vertigo Respiratory: Cough, pharyngitis, pneumonia Special Senses: Cataracts, decreased hearing, diplopia, lacrimation disorder Urogenital: Prostatic disorder Severe vision decrease, equivalent of >=4 lines, within 7 days after treatment has been reported in 1%-5% of patients. Partial recovery of vision was observed in some patients. Photosensitivity reactions usually occurred in the form of skin sunburn following exposure to sunlight. The higher incidence of back pain in the Visudyne group occurred primarily during infusion. The following adverse events have occurred either at low incidence (<1%) during clinical trials or have been reported during the use of Visudyne in clinical practice where these events were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size and frequency of occurrence cannot be determined precisely. They have been chosen for inclusion based on factors such as seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to Visudyne, or a combination of these factors: Ocular Treatment Site: Retinal detachment (nonrhegmatogenous), retinal or choroidal vessel nonperfusion, retinal pigment epithelial tear Non-ocular Events: Chest pain and other musculoskeletal pain during infusion"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies in humans have not been conducted with VISUDYNE. Verteporfin is rapidly eliminated by the liver, mainly as unchanged drug. Metabolism is limited and occurs by liver and plasma esterases. Microsomal cytochrome P450 does not appear to play a role in verteporfin metabolism. Based on the mechanism of action of verteporfin, many drugs used concomitantly could influence the effect of VISUDYNE therapy. Possible examples include the following: Calcium channel blockers, polymyxin B or radiation therapy could enhance the rate of VISUDYNE uptake by the vascular endothelium. Other photosensitizing agents (e.g., tetracyclines, sulfonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, thiazide diuretics and griseofulvin) could increase the potential for skin photosensitivity reactions. Compounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, β-carotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol, would be expected to decrease VISUDYNE activity. Drugs that decrease clotting, vasoconstriction or platelet aggregation, e.g., thromboxane A2 inhibitors, could also decrease the efficacy of VISUDYNE therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: -Local Adverse Reactions - Extravasation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Exposure to Sun or Direct Light [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Decreased Vision after Treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Porphyria and hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ˃10%) are: -injection site reactions (6.1) -visual disturbances (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Severe chest pain, vaso-vagal and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Vaso-vagal and hypersensitivity reactions on rare occasions can be severe. These reactions may include syncope, sweating, dizziness, rash, dyspnea, flushing and changes in blood pressure and heart rate.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Extravasation: If extravasation occurs, the infusion should be stopped immediately. The extravasation area must be thoroughly protected from direct light until swelling and discoloration have faded in order to prevent the occurrence of local burn. (5.1) -Following injection with VISUDYNE (verteporfin for injection), care should be taken to avoid exposure of skin or eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for 5 days. (5.2) 5.1 Local Adverse Reactions - Extravasation Standard precautions should be taken during infusion of VISUDYNE (verteporfin for injection) to avoid extravasation. Examples of standard precautions include, but are not limited to: - A free-flowing intravenous (IV) line should be established before starting VISUDYNE infusion and the line should be carefully monitored. - Due to the possible fragility of vein walls of some elderly patients, it is strongly recommended that the largest arm vein possible, preferably antecubital, be used for injection. - Small veins in the back of the hand should be avoided. Extravasation of VISUDYNE, especially if the affected area is exposed to light, can cause severe pain, inflammation, swelling or discoloration at the injection site. If extravasation does occur, the infusion should be stopped immediately. The extravasation area must be thoroughly protected from direct light until swelling and discoloration have faded in order to prevent the occurrence of local burn, which could be severe. Cold compresses should be applied to the injection site. Oral medications for pain relief may be administered. 5.2 Exposure to Sun or Direct Light Following injection with VISUDYNE (verteporfin for injection), care should be taken to avoid exposure of skin or eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for 5 days. In the event of extravasation during infusion, the extravasation area must be thoroughly protected from direct light until the swelling and discoloration have faded in order to prevent the occurrence of a local burn which could be severe. If emergency surgery is necessary within 48 hours after treatment, as much of the internal tissue as possible should be protected from intense light. 5.3 Decreased Vision after Treatment Patients who experience severe decrease of vision of 4 lines or more within 1 week after treatment should not be retreated, at least until their vision completely recovers to pretreatment levels and the potential benefits and risks of subsequent treatment are carefully considered by the treating physician."
