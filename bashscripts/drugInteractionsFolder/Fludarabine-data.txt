        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions include myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever and chills, infection, and nausea and vomiting. Other commonly reported events include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weakness. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. The most frequently reported adverse reactions and those reactions which are more clearly related to the drug are arranged below according to body system. Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 30%) include myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever, infection, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, cough and weakness ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Hematopoietic Systems Hematologic events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia) were reported in the majority of CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. During fludarabine phosphate treatment of 133 patients with CLL, the absolute neutrophil count decreased to less than 500/mm3 in 59% of patients, hemoglobin decreased from pretreatment values by at least 2 grams percent in 60%, and platelet count decreased from pretreatment values by at least 50% in 55%. Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may affect multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient treated with fludarabine phosphate. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemias have been reported to occur in patients receiving fludarabine phosphate. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. 6.2 Metabolic Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. This complication may include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hematuria, urate crystalluria, and renal failure. The onset of this syndrome may be heralded by flank pain and hematuria. 6.3 Nervous System Objective weakness, agitation, confusion, visual disturbances, and coma have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate at the recommended dose. Peripheral neuropathy has been observed in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate and one case of wrist-drop was reported. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] In post marketing experience, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported. Most cases had a fatal outcome. Many of these cases were confounded by prior and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The median time to onset was approximately one year. 6.4 Pulmonary System Pneumonia, a frequent manifestation of infection in CLL patients, occurred in 16%, and 22% of those treated with fludarabine phosphate in the MDAH and SWOG studies, respectively. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to fludarabine phosphate characterized by dyspnea, cough and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate have been observed. In post-marketing experience, cases of severe pulmonary toxicity have been observed with fludarabine phosphate use which resulted in ARDS, respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure. After an infectious origin has been excluded, some patients experienced symptom improvement with corticosteroids. 6.5 Gastrointestinal System Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. 6.6 Cardiovascular Edema has been frequently reported. One patient developed a pericardial effusion possibly related to treatment with fludarabine phosphate. No other severe cardiovascular events were considered to be drug related. 6.7 Genitourinary System Hemorrhagic cystitis has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. 6.8 Skin Skin toxicity, consisting primarily of skin rashes, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. 6.9 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Data in Table 1 are derived from the 133 patients with CLL who received fludarabine phosphate in the MDAH and SWOG studies.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe bone marrow suppression, notably anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Monitor blood counts before and during treatment. ( 5.2 ) Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Use only irradiated blood products for transfusions. ( 5.5 ) Infections. Monitor for infection. ( 5.3 ) Renal Insufficiency. Reduce dose for moderate renal impairment and monitor closely. Do not administer to patients with severe renal impairment. ( 5.7 ) Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Take precautions for patients at high risk for TLS. ( 5.4 ) May cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Neurotoxicity There are clear dose dependent toxic effects seen with fludarabine phosphate. Dose levels approximately 4 times greater (96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) than that recommended for CLL (25 mg/m2/day for 5 days) were associated with a syndrome characterized by delayed blindness, coma and death. Symptoms appeared from 21 to 60 days following the last dose. Thirteen of 36 patients (36%) who received fludarabine phosphate at high doses (96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) developed this severe neurotoxicity. This syndrome has been reported rarely in patients treated with doses in the range of the recommended CLL dose of 25 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 28 days. The effect of chronic administration of fludarabine phosphate on the central nervous system is unknown; however, patients have received the recommended dose for up to 15 courses of therapy. 5.2 Hematological Adverse Reactions Severe bone marrow suppression, notably anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. In a Phase I study in adult solid tumor patients, the median time to nadir counts was 13 days (range, 3 to 25 days) for granulocytes and 16 days (range, 2 to 32 days) for platelets. Most patients had hematologic impairment at baseline either as a result of disease or as a result of prior myelosuppressive therapy. Cumulative myelosuppression may be seen. While chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is often reversible, administration of Fludarabine Phosphate Injection requires careful hematologic monitoring. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in adult patients. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. Instances of life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia have been reported to occur after one or more cycles of treatment with fludarabine phosphate in patients with or without a previous history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positive Coombs' test and who may or may not be in remission from their disease. Steroids may or may not be effective in controlling these hemolytic episodes. The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. The mechanism(s) which predispose patients to the development of this complication has not been identified. Patients undergoing treatment with Fludarabine Phosphate Injection should be evaluated and closely monitored for hemolysis. 5.3 Infections Of the 133 adult CLL patients in the two trials, there were 29 fatalities during study. Approximately 50% of the fatalities were due to infection and 25% due to progressive disease. 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with fludarabine phosphate treatment has been reported in CLL patients with large tumor burdens. Since fludarabine phosphate can induce a response as early as the first week of treatment, precautions should be taken in those patients at risk of developing this complication. 5.5 Use of Transfusions Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed rarely after transfusion of non-irradiated blood in fludarabine phosphate treated patients. Consideration should, therefore, be given to the use of irradiated blood products in those patients requiring transfusions while undergoing treatment with Fludarabine Phosphate Injection. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity In a clinical investigation using fludarabine phosphate in combination with pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults, there was an unacceptably high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, the use of Fludarabine Phosphate Injection in combination with pentostatin is not recommended. 5.7 Renal Impairment There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal insufficiency. Fludarabine Phosphate Injection must be administered cautiously in patients with renal insufficiency. The total body clearance of 2-fluoro-ara-A has been shown to be directly correlated with creatinine clearance. Patients with moderate impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2) should have their fludarabine phosphate dose reduced by 20% and be monitored closely. Fludarabine phosphate is not recommended for patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.8 Monitoring Hematologic and Nonhematologic Toxicity Fludarabine Phosphate Injection is an antineoplastic agent with potentially significant toxic side effects. Patients undergoing therapy should be closely observed for signs of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Hematopoietic Suppression During treatment, the patient's hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. 5.9 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D: Fludarabine phosphate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fludarabine phosphate was teratogenic in rats and in rabbits. Fludarabine phosphate was administered intravenously at doses of 0, 1, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats on days 6 to 15 of gestation. At 10 and 30 mg/kg/day in rats, there was an increased incidence of various skeletal malformations. Fludarabine phosphate was administered intravenously at doses of 0, 1, 5 or 8 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits on days 6 to 15 of gestation. Dose-related teratogenic effects manifested by external deformities and skeletal malformations were observed in the rabbits at 5 and 8 mg/kg/day. Drug-related deaths or toxic effects on maternal and fetal weights were not observed. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If Fludarabine Phosphate Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Very common adverse events include myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever and chills, fatigue, weakness, infection, pneumonia, cough, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other commonly reported events include malaise, mucositis and anorexia. Serious opportunistic infections (such as latent viral reactivation, herpes zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Adverse events and those reactions which are more clearly related to the drug are arranged below according to body system. Hematopoietic Systems Hematologic events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia) were reported in the majority of CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. During fludarabine phosphate for injection treatment of 133 patients with CLL, the absolute neutrophil count decreased to less than 500/mm3 in 59% of patients, hemoglobin decreased from pretreatment values by at least 2 grams percent in 60%, and platelet count decreased from pretreatment values by at least 50% in 55%. Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may affect multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in post-marketing surveillance. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena such as hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, and acquired hemophilia have been reported to occur in patients receiving fludarabine phosphate for injection (see WARNINGS section). The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate for injection developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. In post-marketing experience, cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, mainly associated with prior, concomitant or subsequent treatment with alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, or irradiation have been reported. Infections Serious, and sometimes fatal infections, including opportunistic infections and reactivations of latent viral infections such as VZV (herpes zoster), Epstein-Barr virus and JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Rare cases of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. In post-marketing experience, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported. Most cases had a fatal outcome. Many of these cases were confounded by prior and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The time to onset has ranged from a few weeks to approximately one year after initiating treatment. Of the 133 adult CLL patients in the two trials, there were 29 fatalities during study, approximately 50% of which were due to infection. Metabolic Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. This complication may include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hematuria, urate crystalluria, and renal failure. The onset of this syndrome may be heralded by flank pain and hematuria. Nervous System (See WARNINGS section) Objective weakness, agitation, confusion, seizures, visual disturbances, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, blindness and coma have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection at the recommended dose. Peripheral neuropathy has been observed in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection and one case of wrist-drop was reported. There have been additional reports of cerebral hemorrhage though the frequency is not known. Pulmonary System Pneumonia, a frequent manifestation of infection in CLL patients, occurred in 16%, and 22% of those treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection in the MDAH and SWOG studies, respectively. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to fludarabine phosphate for injection characterized by dyspnea, cough and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate have been observed. In post-marketing experience, cases of severe pulmonary toxicity have been observed with fludarabine phosphate for injection use which resulted in ARDS, respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis and respiratory failure. After an infectious origin has been excluded, some patients experienced symptom improvement with corticosteroids. Gastrointestinal System Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Elevations of pancreatic enzyme levels have also been reported. Cardiovascular Edema has been frequently reported. One patient developed a pericardial effusion possibly related to treatment with fludarabine phosphate for injection. There have been additional reports of heart failure and arrhythmia though the frequency is rare. No other severe cardiovascular events were considered to be drug related. Genitourinary System Rare cases of hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Skin Skin toxicity, consisting primarily of skin rashes, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and pemphigus have been reported, with fatal outcomes in some cases. Neoplasms Worsening or flare-up of pre-existing skin cancer lesions, as well as new onset of skin cancer, has been reported in patients during or after treatment with fludarabine phosphate for injection.

Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may affect multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena such as hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, and acquired hemophilia have been reported to occur in patients receiving fludarabine phosphate for injection (see WARNINGS section). The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate for injection developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. In postmarketing experience, cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, mainly associated with prior, concomitant or subsequent treatment with alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, or irradiation have been reported. Infections Serious, and sometimes fatal infections, including opportunistic infections and reactivations of latent viral infections such as VZV (herpes zoster), Epstein-Barr virus and JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Rare cases of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. In postmarketing experience, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported. Most cases had a fatal outcome. Many of these cases were confounded by prior and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The time to onset has ranged from a few weeks to approximately one year after initiating treatment. Of the 133 adult CLL patients in the two trials, there were 29 fatalities during study, approximately 50% of which were due to infection. Metabolic Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. This complication may include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hematuria, urate crystalluria, and renal failure. The onset of this syndrome may be heralded by flank pain and hematuria. Nervous System (See WARNINGS section.) Objective weakness, agitation, confusion, seizures, visual disturbances, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, blindness and coma have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection at the recommended dose. Peripheral neuropathy has been observed in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection and one case of wrist-drop was reported. There have been additional reports of cerebral hemorrhage though the frequency is not known. Pulmonary System Pneumonia, a frequent manifestation of infection in CLL patients, occurred in 16% and 22% of those treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection in the MDAH and SWOG studies, respectively. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to fludarabine phosphate for injection characterized by dyspnea, cough and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate have been observed. In postmarketing experience, cases of severe pulmonary toxicity have been observed with fludarabine phosphate for injection use which resulted in ARDS, respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis and respiratory failure. After an infectious origin has been excluded, some patients experienced symptom improvement with corticosteroids. Gastrointestinal System Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Elevations of pancreatic enzyme levels have also been reported. Cardiovascular Edema has been frequently reported. One patient developed a pericardial effusion possibly related to treatment with fludarabine phosphate for injection. There have been additional reports of heart failure and arrhythmia though the frequency is rare. No other severe cardiovascular events were considered to be drug related. Genitourinary System Rare cases of hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Skin Skin toxicity, consisting primarily of skin rashes, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and pemphigus have been reported, with fatal outcomes in some cases. Neoplasms Worsening or flare up of preexisting skin cancer lesions, as well as new onset of skin cancer, has been reported in patients during or after treatment with fludarabine phosphate for injection. Hepatobiliary Disorders Elevations of hepatic enzyme levels have been reported.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions and those reactions which are more clearly related to the drug are arranged below according to body system. Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 30%) include myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever, infection, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, cough and weakness (6).

During fludarabine phosphate treatment of 133 patients with CLL, the absolute neutrophil count decreased to less than 500/mm3 in 59% of patients, hemoglobin decreased from pretreatment values by at least 2 grams percent in 60%, and platelet count decreased from pretreatment values by at least 50% in 55%. Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may affect multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient treated with fludarabine phosphate. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena such as hemolytic anemias, autoimmune thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, and acquired hemophilia have been reported to occur in patients receiving fludarabine phosphate. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. In post-marketing experience, cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, mainly associated with prior, concomitant or subsequent treatment with alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, or irradiation have been reported. 6.2 Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including opportunistic infections and reactivations of latent viral infections such as VZV (herpes zoster), Epstein-Barr virus and JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. Rare cases of Epstein-Barr (EBV) associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. In post-marketing experience, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been reported. Most cases had a fatal outcome. Many of these cases were confounded by prior and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The time to onset ranged from a few weeks to approximately one year after initiating treatment. Of the 133 adult CLL patients in the two trials, there were 29 fatalities during study, approximately 50% of which were due to infection. 6.3 Metabolic Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. This complication may include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hematuria, urate crystalluria, and renal failure. The onset of this syndrome may be heralded by flank pain and hematuria. 6.4 Nervous System Objective weakness, agitation, confusion, seizures, visual disturbances, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, blindness and coma have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine phosphate at the recommended dose. Peripheral neuropathy has been observed in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate and one case of wrist-drop was reported. There have been additional reports of cerebral hemorrhage though the frequency is not known. [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] 6.5 Pulmonary System Pneumonia, a frequent manifestation of infection in CLL patients, occurred in 16%, and 22% of those treated with fludarabine phosphate in the MDAH and SWOG studies, respectively. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to fludarabine phosphate characterized by dyspnea, cough and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate have been observed. In postmarketing experience, cases of severe pulmonary toxicity have been observed with fludarabine phosphate use which resulted in ARDS, respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis and respiratory failure. After an infectious origin has been excluded, some patients experienced symptom improvement with corticosteroids. 6.6 Gastrointestinal System Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis, and hemorrhage have been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. Elevations of pancreatic enzyme levels have also been reported. 6.7 Cardiovascular Edema has been frequently reported. One patient developed a pericardial effusion possibly related to treatment with fludarabine phosphate. There have been reports of heart failure and arrhythmia. No other severe cardiovascular events were considered to be drug related. 6.8 Genitourinary System Hemorrhagic cystitis has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. 6.9 Skin Skin toxicity, consisting primarily of skin rashes, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. Erythema multiforme, Steven-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and pemphigus have been reported, with fatal outcomes in some cases. 6.10 Neoplasms Worsening or flare-up of preexisting skin cancer lesions, as well as new onset of skin cancer, has been reported in patients during or after treatment with fludarabine phosphate. 6.11 Hepatobiliary Disorders Elevations of hepatic enzyme levels have been reported. 6.12 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Data in Table 1 are derived from the 133 patients with CLL who received fludarabine phosphate in the MDAH and SWOG studies.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (see BOXED WARNINGS) •Severe bone marrow suppression, notably anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Monitor blood counts before and during treatment. (5.2) •Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Use only irradiated blood products for transfusions. (5.4) •Infections. Monitor for infection. (5.2) •Renal Insufficiency. Reduce dose for moderate renal impairment and monitor closely. Do not administer to patients with severe renal impairment. (5.9) •Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Take precautions for patients at high risk for TLS. (5.8) •Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.6) 5.1 Dose Dependent Neurologic Toxicities There are clear dose dependent toxic effects seen with fludarabine phosphate. Dose levels approximately 4 times greater (96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) than that recommended for CLL (25 mg/m2/day for 5 days) were associated with a syndrome characterized by delayed blindness, coma and death. Symptoms appeared from 21 to 60 days following the last dose. Thirteen of 36 patients (36%) who received fludarabine phosphate at high doses (96 mg/m2/day for 5 to 7 days) developed this severe neurotoxicity. Similar severe central nervous system toxicity, including coma, seizures, agitation and confusion, has been reported in patients treated at doses in the range of the dose recommended for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In postmarketing experience neurotoxicity has been reported to occur either earlier or later than in clinical trials (range 7 to 225 days). The effect of chronic administration of fludarabine phosphate on the central nervous system is unknown; however, patients have received the recommended dose for up to 15 courses of therapy. Fludarabine phosphate may reduce the ability to drive or use mechanical equipment, since fatigue, weakness, visual disturbances, confusion, agitation and seizures have been observed. 5.2 Bone Marrow Suppression Severe bone marrow suppression, notably anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. In a Phase I study in adult solid tumor patients, the median time to nadir counts was 13 days (range, 3 to 25 days) for granulocytes and 16 days (range, 2 to 32 days) for platelets. Most patients had hematologic impairment at baseline either as a result of disease or as a result of prior myelosuppressive therapy. Cumulative myelosuppression may be seen. While chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is often reversible, administration of fludarabine phosphate injection requires careful hematologic monitoring. Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in adult patients. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. 5.3 Autoimmune Reactions Instances of life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena such as hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Evans syndrome, and acquired hemophilia have been reported to occur after one or more cycles of treatment with fludarabine phosphate in patients with or without a previous history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positive Coombs' test and who may or may not be in remission from their disease. Steroids may or may not be effective in controlling these hemolytic episodes. The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. The mechanism(s) which predispose patients to the development of this complication has not been identified. Patients undergoing treatment with fludarabine phosphate injection should be evaluated and closely monitored for hemolysis. Discontinuation of therapy with fludarabine phosphate injection is recommended in case of hemolysis. 5.4 Transfusion Associated Graft-Versus-Host Disease Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed after transfusion of non-irradiated blood in fludarabine phosphate treated patients. Fatal outcome as a consequence of this disease has been reported. Therefore, to minimize the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, patients who require blood transfusion and who are undergoing, or who have received, treatment with fludarabine phosphate injection should receive irradiated blood only. 5.5 Pulmonary Toxicity In a clinical investigation using fludarabine phosphate in combination with pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults, there was an unacceptably high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, the use of fludarabine phosphate injection in combination with pentostatin is not recommended. 5.6 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Based on its mechanism of action, fludarabine phosphate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of fludarabine phosphate injection in pregnant women. Fludarabine phosphate was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Male Fertility and Reproductive Outcomes Males with female sexual partners of childbearing potential should use contraception during and after cessation of fludarabine phosphate therapy. Fludarabine phosphate may damage testicular tissue and spermatozoa. Possible sperm DNA damage raises concerns about loss of fertility and genetic abnormalities in fetuses. The duration of this effect is uncertain. [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] 5.8 Tumor Lysis Tumor lysis syndrome has been associated with fludarabine phosphate treatment. This syndrome has been reported in CLL patients with large tumor burdens. Since fludarabine phosphate can induce a response as early as the first week of treatment, precautions should be taken in those patients at risk of developing this complication. 5.9 Renal Impairment Fludarabine phosphate injection must be administered cautiously in patients with renal impairment. The total body clearance of 2-fluoro-ara-A has been shown to be directly correlated with creatinine clearance. Patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 79 mL/min should have their fludarabine phosphate dose reduced and be monitored closely for excessive toxicity. Fludarabine phosphate should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] In patients aged 65 years or older, creatinine clearance should be measured before start of treatment. 5.10 Vaccination During and after treatment with fludarabine phosphate injection, vaccination with live vaccines should be avoided."
