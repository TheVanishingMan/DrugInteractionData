        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Acidifying and Alkalinizing Agents: Agents that alter urinary pH can alter blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents decrease amphetamine blood levels, while alkalinizing agents increase amphetamine blood levels. Adjust VYVANSE dosage accordingly (2.6, 7.1) 7.1 Clinically Important Interactions with VYVANSE Table 5: Effect of Other Drugs on VYVANSE Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale Clinical Recommendation Acidifying and Alkalinizing Agents Ascorbic acid and other agents that acidify urine increase urinary excretion and decrease the half-life of amphetamine. Sodium bicarbonate and other agents that alkalinize urine decrease urinary excretion and extend the half-life of amphetamine. Adjust the dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] Table 6: Effect of VYVANSE on Other Drugs Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale Clinical Recommendation Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Do not administer VYVANSE concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment [see Contraindications (4)] 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with VYVANSE From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of VYVANSE is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. In addition, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is needed when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g. atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) is necessary when VYVANSE is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling Serious Cardiovascular Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Psychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Suppression of Growth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) in children, adolescents, and/or adults with ADHD were anorexia, anxiety, decreased appetite, decreased weight, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, irritability, insomnia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting (6.1) Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) in adults with BED were dry mouth, insomnia, decreased appetite, increased heart rate, constipation, feeling jittery, and anxiety (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shire US Inc. at 1-800-828-2088 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder The safety data in this section is based on data from the 4-week parallel-group controlled clinical studies of VYVANSE in pediatric and adult patients with ADHD [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in ADHD Clinical Trials In the controlled trial in patients ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), 9% (20/218) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/72) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of VYVANSE-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were ECG voltage criteria for ventricular hypertrophy, tic, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, insomnia, and rash [2 instances for each adverse reaction, i.e., 2/218 (1%)]. In the controlled trial in patients ages 13 to 17 years (Study 4), 4% (10/233) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/77) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were irritability (3/233; 1%), decreased appetite (2/233; 1%), and insomnia (2/233; 1%). In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), 6% (21/358) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (1/62) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of VYVANSE-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (8/358; 2%), tachycardia (3/358; 1%), irritability (2/358; 1%), hypertension (4/358; 1%), headache (2/358; 1%), anxiety (2/358; 1%), and dyspnea (3/358; 1%). The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) reported in children, adolescents, and/or adults were anorexia, anxiety, decreased appetite, decreased weight, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, irritability, insomnia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among VYVANSE Treated Patients with ADHD in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions reported in the controlled trials in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), adolescent patients ages 13 to 17 years (Study 4), and adult patients (Study 7) treated with VYVANSE or placebo are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Children (Ages 6 to 12 Years) with ADHD Taking VYVANSE and at least Twice the Incidence in Patients Taking Placebo in a 4-Week Clinical Trial (Study 1) VYVANSE (n=218) Placebo (n=72) Decreased Appetite 39% 4% Insomnia 23% 3% Abdominal Pain Upper 12% 6% Irritability 10% 0% Vomiting 9% 4% Weight Decreased 9% 1% Nausea 6% 3% Dry Mouth 5% 0% Dizziness 5% 0% Affect lability 3% 0% Rash 3% 0% Pyrexia 2% 1% Somnolence 2% 1% Tic 2% 0% Table 2 Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Adolescent (Ages 13 to 17 Years) Patients with ADHD Taking VYVANSE and at least Twice the Incidence in Patients Taking Placebo in a 4-Week Clinical Trial (Study 4) VYVANSE (n=233) Placebo (n=77) Decreased Appetite 34% 3% Insomnia 13% 4% Weight Decreased 9% 0% Dry Mouth 4% 1% Table 3 Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Adult Patients with ADHD Taking VYVANSE and at least Twice the Incidence in Patients Taking Placebo in a 4-Week Clinical Trial (Study 7) VYVANSE (n=358) Placebo (n=62) Decreased Appetite 27% 2% Insomnia 27% 8% Dry Mouth 26% 3% Diarrhea 7% 0% Nausea 7% 0% Anxiety 6% 0% Anorexia 5% 0% Feeling Jittery 4% 0% Agitation 3% 0% Increased Blood Pressure 3% 0% Hyperhidrosis 3% 0% Restlessness 3% 0% Decreased Weight 3% 0% Dyspnea 2% 0% Increased Heart Rate 2% 0% Tremor 2% 0% In addition, in the adult population erectile dysfunction was observed in 2.6% of males on VYVANSE and 0% on placebo; decreased libido was observed in 1.4% of subjects on VYVANSE and 0% on placebo. Weight Loss and Slowing Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients with ADHD In a controlled trial of VYVANSE in children ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), mean weight loss from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 1 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in children ages 6 to 12 years who received VYVANSE over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a slowing in growth rate, measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.9 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of VYVANSE in adolescents ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight loss from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 2.0 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in adolescents, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and -2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Weight Loss in Adults with ADHD In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), mean weight loss after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo. Binge Eating Disorder The safety data in this section is based on data from two 12 week parallel group, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BED [see Clinical Studies 14.2]. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors other than obesity and smoking were excluded. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in BED Clinical Trials In controlled trials of patients ages 18 to 55 years, 5.1% (19/373) of VYVANSE-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2.4% (9/372) of placebo-treated patients. No single adverse reaction led to discontinuation in 1% or more of VYVANSE-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) reported in adults were dry mouth, insomnia, decreased appetite, increased heart rate, constipation, feeling jittery, and anxiety. Adverse reactions reported in the pooled controlled trials in adult patients (Study 10 and 11) treated with VYVANSE or placebo are presented in Table 4 below. Table 4 Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Adult Patients with BED Taking VYVANSE and at least Twice the Incidence in Patients Taking Placebo in 12-Week Clinical Trials (Study 10 and 11) VYVANSE (N=373) Placebo (N=372) Dry Mouth 36% 7% InsomniaIncludes all preferred terms containing the word \"insomnia.\" 20% 8% Decreased Appetite 8% 2% Increased Heart RateIncludes the preferred terms heart rate increased and tachycardia. 7% 1% Feeling Jittery 6% 1% Constipation 6% 1% Anxiety 5% 1% Diarrhea 4% 2% Decreased Weight 4% 0% Hyperhidrosis 4% 0% Vomiting 2% 1% Gastroenteritis 2% 1% Paresthesia 2% 1% Pruritis 2% 1% Upper Abdominal Pain 2% 0% Energy Increased 2% 0% Urinary Tract Infection 2% 0% Nightmare 2% 0% Restlessness 2% 0% Oropharyngeal Pain 2% 0% 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of VYVANSE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events are as follows: palpitations, cardiomyopathy, mydriasis, diplopia, difficulties with visual accommodation, blurred vision, eosinophilic hepatitis, anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, dyskinesia, tics, bruxism, depression, dermatillomania, aggression, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, angioedema, urticaria, seizures, libido changes, frequent or prolonged erections, constipation, and rhabdomyolysis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death in children and adolescents with serious heart problems, as well as sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction in adults reported. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, or coronary artery disease (5.2) Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. Consider benefits and risks before use in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic (5.3) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: May cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychosis. Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to stimulant use (5.4) Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight in pediatric patients during treatment (5.5) Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants (5.6) 5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products), including VYVANSE, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]. 5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during VYVANSE treatment. 5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension. 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a mixed/manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing VYVANSE. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients. 5.5 Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of VYVANSE in patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the VYVANSE groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon Stimulants, including VYVANSE, are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients."

Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to stimulant use (5.4) Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight in pediatric patients during treatment (5.5) Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Stimulants are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants (5.6) 5.1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products), including VYVANSE, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]. 5.2 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during VYVANSE treatment. 5.3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2-4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3-6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension. 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a mixed/manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing VYVANSE. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients. 5.5 Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of VYVANSE in patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the VYVANSE groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon Stimulants, including VYVANSE, are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Urinary acidifying agents may reduce blood levels of amphetamine. ( 7.2 ) Urinary alkalinizing agents may increase blood levels of amphetamine. ( 7.3 ) MAOI antidepressants are contraindicated. ( 4 ; 7.3 ) The effects of adrenergic blockers, antihistamines, antihypertensives, phenobarbital, and phenytoin may be reduced by amphetamines. ( 7.4 ) The effects of tricyclic antidepressants, meperidine, phenobarbital and phenytoin may be potentiated by amphetamines. ( 7.5 ) Norepinephrine may potentiate the effects of amphetamines. ( 7.7 ) 7.1 Agents Whose Blood Levels May be Impacted by Vyvanse Extended release guanfacine: In a drug interaction study (N=40), administration of an extended release guanfacine (4 mg) in combination with Vyvanse (50 mg) increased guanfacine maximum plasma concentration by 19%, whereas, exposure (area under the curve; AUC) was increased by 7%. These small changes are not expected to be clinically meaningful. In this study, no effect on d-amphetamine exposure was observed following co-administration of extended release guanfacine and Vyvanse. 7.2 Agents that Lower Blood Levels of Amphetamines Urinary Acidifying Agents These agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Methenamine Therapy Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy. 7.3 Agents that Increase Blood Levels of Amphetamines Urinary Alkalinizing Agents These agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results. 7.4 Agents Whose Effects May be Reduced by Amphetamines Adrenergic Blockers Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines. Antihistamines Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines. Antihypertensives Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives. Veratrum Alkaloids Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids. Ethosuximide Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide. 7.5 Agents Whose Effects May be Potentiated by Amphetamines Antidepressants, Tricyclic Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated. Meperidine Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine. Phenobarbital Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital; co-administration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action. Phenytoin Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; co-administration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action. 7.6 Agents that May Reduce the Effects of Amphetamines Chlorpromazine Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning. Haloperidol Haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines. Lithium Carbonate The anorectic and stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate. 7.7 Agents that May Potentiate the Effects of Amphetamines Norepinephrine Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine. Propoxyphene Overdosage In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur. 7.8 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Amphetamines can cause a significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening. Amphetamine may interfere with urinary steroid determinations."

( 6.1 ) Adults: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at a rate at least twice placebo) were upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, feeling jittery, irritability, anorexia, decreased appetite, headaches, anxiety, and insomnia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shire US Inc. at 1-800-828-2088 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The premarketing development program for Vyvanse included exposures in a total of 995 participants in clinical trials (348 pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years, 233 adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 years, 358 adult patients and 56 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 348 pediatric (aged 6 to 12) patients were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies (one parallel-group and one crossover), one open-label extension study, and one single-dose clinical pharmacology study, 233 adolescent (aged 13 to 17) patients were evaluated in one controlled clinical study, and 358 adult patients were evaluated in one controlled clinical study and one open-label extension study. The information included in this section is based on data from the 4-week parallel-group controlled clinical studies in pediatric and adult patients with ADHD. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reactions categories. In the tables and listings that follow, MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed at least once. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Clinical Trials In the controlled pediatric (aged 6 to 12) trial, 9% (20/218) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/72) who received placebo. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of Vyvanse-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were ECG voltage criteria for ventricular hypertrophy, tic, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, insomnia, and rash (2/218 each; 1%). In the controlled adolescent (aged 13 to 17) trial, 4% (10/233) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events compared to 1% (1/77) who received placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related were irritability (3/233; 1%), decreased appetite (2/233; 1%), and insomnia (2/233; 1%). In the controlled adult trial, 6% (21/358) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events compared to 2% (1/62) who received placebo. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of Vyvanse-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (8/358; 2%), tachycardia (3/358; 1%), irritability (2/358; 1%), hypertension (4/358; 1%), headache (2/358; 1%), anxiety (2/358; 1%), and dyspnea (3/358; 1%). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Vyvanse Treated Patients in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions reported in the controlled trials in pediatric (aged 6 to 17 years) and adult patients treated with Vyvanse or placebo are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse reactions in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatment uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse reaction incidence rate in the population studied.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Cardiovascular Events: Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Stimulant products generally should not be used in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious heart problems. ( 5.1 ) Increase in Blood Pressure: Monitor blood pressure and pulse at appropriate intervals in patients taking Vyvanse. Use with caution in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic. ( 5.1 ) Psychiatric Adverse Events: Use of stimulants may cause treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychosis. Clinical evaluation for bipolar disorder is recommended prior to stimulant use. Monitor for aggressive behavior. ( 5.2 ) Seizures: may lower the convulsive threshold, and in the presence of seizures, should be discontinued. ( 5.3 ) Visual Disturbance: difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment. ( 5.4 ) Tics: may exacerbate tics. Clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's syndrome is recommended prior to stimulant administration. ( 5.5 ) Long-Term Suppression of Growth: monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients taking Vyvanse. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serious Cardiovascular Events Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. Adults Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2-4 mm Hg) and average heart rate (about 3-6 bpm) and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g. those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients Being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g. electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation. 5.2 Psychiatric Adverse Events Pre-existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Bipolar Illness Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania, can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients. Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment of ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of, or worsening of, aggressive behavior or hostility. 5.3 Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued. 5.4 Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment. 5.5 Tics Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics and Tourette's syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's syndrome should precede use of stimulant medications. 5.6 Long-Term Suppression of Growth In a controlled trial of Vyvanse in children ages 6 to 12 years, mean weight loss from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, compared to a 1 lb weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in children ages 6 to 12 years who received Vyvanse over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a slowing in growth rate, measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.6 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of Vyvanse in adolescents ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight loss from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, compared to a 2.0 lb weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in adolescents, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 lbs. and -2.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.7 Prescribing and Dispensing The least amount of amphetamine feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Vyvanse should be used with caution in patients who use other sympathomimetic drugs."

The premarketing development program for Vyvanse included exposures in a total of 995 participants in clinical trials (348 pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years, 233 adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 years, 358 adult patients and 56 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 348 pediatric (aged 6 to 12) patients were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies (one parallel-group and one crossover), one open-label extension study, and one single-dose clinical pharmacology study, 233 adolescent (aged 13 to 17) patients were evaluated in one controlled clinical study, and 358 adult patients were evaluated in one controlled clinical study and one open-label extension study.

In the controlled adolescent (ages 13 to 17 years) trial, 4% (10/233) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 1% (1/77) who received placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related were irritability (3/233; 1%), decreased appetite (2/233; 1%), and insomnia (2/233; 1%). In the controlled adult trial, 6% (21/358) of Vyvanse-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (1/62) who received placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of Vyvanse-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (8/358; 2%), tachycardia (3/358; 1%), irritability (2/358; 1%), hypertension (4/358; 1%), headache (2/358; 1%), anxiety (2/358; 1%), and dyspnea (3/358; 1%). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Vyvanse Treated Patients in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions reported in the controlled trials in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years, adolescent patients ages 13 to 17 years, and adult patients treated with Vyvanse or placebo are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 below.

Note: This table includes those reactions for which the incidence in patients taking Vyvanse is at least twice the incidence in patients taking placebo. In addition, adverse reactions observed at a rate of less than 2% in adults included decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. Weight Loss and Slowing Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients In a controlled trial of Vyvanse in children ages 6 to 12 years, mean weight loss from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, compared to a 1 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in children ages 6 to 12 years who received Vyvanse over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a slowing in growth rate, measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.6 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of Vyvanse in adolescents ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight loss from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, compared to a 2.0 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e. treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in adolescents, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and –2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment. Weight Loss in Adults In the controlled adult trial, mean weight loss after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of Vyvanse, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Vyvanse. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders - Palpitations, cardiomyopathy Eye Disorders - Mydriasis, diplopia Hepatobiliary Disorders - Eosinophilic hepatitis Immune System Disorders - Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity Nervous System Disorders - Dyskinesia Psychiatric Disorder - Depression, dysphoria, euphoria, logorrhoea, dermatillomania Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder - Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, angioedema, urticaria"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Cardiovascular Reactions: Sudden death in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems, as well as sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction in adults has been reported in CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses. Stimulant products generally should not be used in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious heart problems (5.1) Increase in Blood Pressure: Monitor blood pressure and pulse in patients taking Vyvanse. Use with caution in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic ( 5.2 ) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Use of stimulants may cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history, or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre-existing psychosis. Clinical evaluation for bipolar disorder is recommended prior to stimulant use. Monitor for aggressive behavior ( 5. 3) Long-Term Suppression of Growth: Monitor height and weight in pediatric patients during treatment (5.4) Seizures: May lower the convulsive threshold. Discontinue if seizures develop (5.5) 5.1 Serious Cardiovascular Reactions Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug. Adults Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs. Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients Being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g. electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation. 5.2 Increased Blood Pressure Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2-4 mm Hg) and average heart rate (about 3-6 bpm) and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g. those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia. 5.3 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Pre-existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Bipolar Illness Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder. Such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g. hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania, can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients. Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment of ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of, or worsening of, aggressive behavior or hostility. 5.4 Long-Term Suppression of Growth In pediatric patients, growth (weight and height) should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including Vyvanse, and children who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Seizures Stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, Vyvanse should be discontinued. 5.6 Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment. 5.7 Tics Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics and Tourette's syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette's syndrome should precede use of Vyvanse."
