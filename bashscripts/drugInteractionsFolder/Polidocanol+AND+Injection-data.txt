        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions occurring at least 3% more frequently than on placebo are mild local reactions at the site of injection. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merz North America, Inc. at 1-866-862-1211 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Study Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In 5 controlled randomized clinical trials, Asclera has been administered to 401 patients with small or very small varicose veins (reticular and spider veins) and compared with another sclerosing agent and with placebo. Patients were 18 to 70 years old. The patient population was predominately female and consisted of Caucasian and Asian patients. Table 1 shows adverse events more common with Asclera or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) 1% than with placebo by at least 3% in the placebo- controlled EASI study (see Clinical Studies [14]). All of these were injection site reactions and most were mild. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in EASI-study ASCLERA (180 patients) STS 1% (105 patients) Placebo (53 patients) Injection site haematoma 42% 65% 19% Injection site irritation 41% 73% 30% Injection site discoloration 38% 74% 4% Injection site pain 24% 31% 9% Injection site pruritus 19% 27% 4% Injection site warmth 16% 21% 6% Neovascularisation 8% 20% 4% Injection site thrombosis 6% 1% 0% Ultrasound examinations at one week (±3 days) and 12 weeks (±2 weeks) after treatment did not reveal deep vein thrombosis in any treatment group. 6.2 Post-marketing Safety Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during use of polidocanol in world-wide experience; in some of these cases these adverse events have been serious or troublesome. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and without a control group, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria generalized, asthma Nervous system disorders: Cerebrovascular accident, migraine, paresthesia (local), loss of consciousness, confusional state, dizziness Cardiac disorders: Cardiac arrest, palpitations Vascular disorders: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, syncope vasovagal, circulatory collapse, vasculitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Skin hyperpigmentation, dermatitis allergic, hypertrichosis (in the area of sclerotherapy) General disorders and injection site conditions: Injection site necrosis, pyrexia, hot flush Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: Nerve injury"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis. (5.1) Do not inject intra-arterially. (5.2) Do not inject intra-perivascularily. (5.3) 5.1 Anaphylaxis Severe allergic reactions have been reported following polidocanol use, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Severe reactions are more frequent with use of larger volumes (> 3 mL). The dose of polidocanol should therefore be minimized. Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately. Severe adverse local effects, including tissue necrosis, may occur following extravasation; therefore, care should be taken in intravenous needle placement and the smallest effective volume at each injection site should be used. After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage, and have the patient walk for 15-20 minutes. Keep the patient under supervision during this period to treat any anaphylactic or allergic reaction (see Dosage and Administration [2]). 5.2 Accidental Intra-arterial Injection Intra-arterial injection can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene. If this occurs consult a vascular surgeon immediately. 5.3 Inadvertent Perivascular Injection Inadvertent perivascular injection of Asclera can cause pain. If pain is severe, a local anesthetic (without adrenaline) may be injected."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials, the most common related adverse events (occurring in ≥3% of patients treated with Varithena™) were pain/discomfort in extremity, infusion site thrombosis (retained coagulum), injection site hematoma or pain, thrombophlebitis superficial, and extravasation.( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocompatibles, Inc. at 1-855-971-VEIN (1-855-971-8346) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under controlled but widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of Varithena™ cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs or procedures and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 1333 patients in 12 clinical trials were evaluated for safety when treated with Varithena™ at dose concentrations of 0.125%, 0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0%, including 437 patients treated with Varithena™ in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Adverse reactions occurring in 3% more patients receiving Varithena™ 1% than receiving placebo are shown in Table 1. a Includes Varithena™ 0.125%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% from the placebo-controlled trials. b Retained coagulum. c Common femoral vein thrombus extension (non-occlusive thrombi starting in the superficial vein and extending into the common femoral vein). Table 1: Treatment-emergent adverse reactions (3% more on Varithena™ 1% than on placebo) through Week 8 (n=588) Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=151) Varithena™ 1.0% (N=149) Pooled a Varithena™ (N=437) Pain in extremity 14 (9.3) 25 (16.8) 65 (14.9) Infusion site thrombosis b 0 24 (16.1) 46 (10.5) Contusion/injection site hematoma 9 (6.0) 23 (15.4) 38 (8.7) Limb discomfort 5 (3.3) 18 (12.1) 32 (7.3) Tenderness/injection site pain 5 (3.3) 16 (10.7) 30 (6.9) Venous thrombosis limb c 0 12 (8.1) 24 (5.5) Thrombophlebitis superficial 2 (1.3) 8 (5.4) 40 (9.2) Deep vein thrombosis 0 7 (4.7) 10 (2.3) In Varithena™-treated patients, 80% of pain events in the treated extremity resolved within 1 week. In the 1333 patients treated with Varithena™, the following venous thrombus adverse events occurred: common femoral vein thrombus extension (2.9%), proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1.7%), distal DVT (1.1%), isolated gastrocnemius, and soleal vein thrombosis (1.4%). Proximal symptomatic venous thrombi occurred in <1% of patients treated with Varithena™. Approximately half (49%) of patients with thrombi received treatment with anticoagulants. Since Varithena™ induces thrombosis in the treated superficial veins, D-dimer is commonly elevated post-treatment and is not useful diagnostically to assess patients for venous thrombus following treatment with Varithena™. Neurologic adverse events (cerebrovascular accident, migraines) have been reported in patients following administration of physician compounded foam sclerosants. None of the 1333 patients in the Varithena™ trials experienced clinically important neurological or visual adverse events suggestive of cerebral gas embolism. The incidence of neurologic and visual adverse events within 1 day of treatment in the placebo-controlled studies was 2.7% in the pooled Varithena™ group and 4.0% in the placebo groups. Skin discoloration adverse events were reported in 1.1% of the pooled Varithena™ group and 0.7% of the placebo group in the placebo-controlled studies."

( 5.2) Venous Thrombosis ( 5.3) 5.1 Anaphylaxis Severe allergic reactions have been reported following administration of liquid polidocanol, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Observe patients for at least 10 minutes following injection and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately. 5.2 Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis Intra-arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene Patients with underlying arterial disease, such as marked peripheral arteriosclerosis or thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s Disease) may be at increased risk for tissue ischemia. If intra-arterial injection of polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately. 5.3 Venous Thrombosis Varithena™ can cause venous thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)] . Follow administration instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospitalization, or pregnancy are at increased risk for developing thrombosis."
