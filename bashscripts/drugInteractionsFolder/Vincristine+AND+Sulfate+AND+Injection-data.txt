        "Drug Interactions The simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of the anticonvulsant and to increase seizure activity. Dosage adjustment should be based on serial blood level monitoring. The contribution of vincristine sulfate to this interaction is not certain. The interaction may result from reduced absorption of phenytoin and an increase in the rate of its metabolism and elimination. Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP 3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vincristine sulfate with itraconazole (a known inhibitor of the metabolic pathway) has been reported to cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of neuromuscular side effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). This interaction is presumed to be related to inhibition of the metabolism of vincristine.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Prior to the use of this drug, patients and/or their parents/guardian should be advised of the possibility of untoward symptoms. In general, adverse reactions are reversible and are related to dosage. The most common adverse reaction is hair loss; the most troublesome adverse reactions are neuromuscular in origin. When single, weekly doses of the drug are employed, the adverse reactions of leukopenia, neuritic pain, and constipation occur but are usually of short duration (i.e., less than 7 days). When the dosage is reduced, these reactions may lessen or disappear. The severity of such reactions seems to increase when the calculated amount of drug is given in divided doses. Other adverse reactions, such as hair loss, sensory loss, paresthesia, difficulty in walking, slapping gait, loss of deep-tendon reflexes, and muscle wasting, may persist for at least as long as therapy is continued. Generalized sensorimotor dysfunction may become progressively more severe with continued treatment. Although most such symptoms usually disappear by about the sixth week after discontinuance of treatment, some neuromuscular difficulties may persist for prolonged periods in some patients. Regrowth of hair may occur while maintenance therapy continues. The following adverse reactions have been reported: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported in patients receiving vincristine, particularly in pediatric patients, as part of standard combination chemotherapy regimens. Some of the patients had fatal outcomes; some who survived had undergone liver transplantation. Hypersensitivity Rare cases of allergic-type reactions, such as anaphylaxis, rash, and edema, that are temporally related to vincristine therapy have been reported in patients receiving vincristine as a part of multidrug chemotherapy regimens. Gastrointestinal Constipation, abdominal cramps, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, oral ulceration, diarrhea, paralytic ileus, intestinal necrosis and/or perforation, and anorexia have occurred. Constipation may take the form of upper-colon impaction, and, on physical examination, the rectum may be empty. Colicky abdominal pain coupled with an empty rectum may mislead the physician. A flat film of the abdomen is useful in demonstrating this condition. All cases have responded to high enemas and laxatives. A routine prophylactic regimen against constipation is recommended for all patients receiving VINCASAR PFS. Paralytic ileus (which mimics the \"surgical abdomen\") may occur, particularly in young pediatric patients. The ileus will reverse itself with temporary discontinuance of VINCASAR PFS injection and with symptomatic care. Genitourinary Polyuria, dysuria, and urinary retention due to bladder atony have occurred. Other drugs known to cause urinary retention (particularly in the elderly) should, if possible, be discontinued for the first few days following administration of VINCASAR PFS. Cardiovascular Hypertension and hypotension have occurred. Chemotherapy combinations that have included vincristine sulfate, when given to patients previously treated with mediastinal radiation, have been associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Causality has not been established. Neurologic Frequently, there is a sequence to the development of neuromuscular side effects. Initially, only sensory impairment and paresthesia may be encountered. With continued treatment, neuritic pain and, later, motor difficulties may occur. There have been no reports of any agent that can reverse the neuromuscular manifestations that may accompany therapy with vincristine sulfate. Loss of deep-tendon reflexes, foot drop, ataxia, and paralysis have been reported with continued administration. Cranial nerve manifestations, such as isolated paresis and/or paralysis of muscles controlled by cranial motor nerves including potentially life-threatening bilateral vocal cord paralysis, may occur in the absence of motor impairment elsewhere; extraocular and laryngeal muscles are those most commonly involved. Jaw pain, pharyngeal pain, parotid gland pain, bone pain, back pain, limb pain, and myalgias have been reported; pain in these areas may be severe. Convulsions, frequently with hypertension, have been reported in a few patients receiving vincristine sulfate. Several instances of convulsions followed by coma have been reported in pediatric patients. Transient cortical blindness and optic atrophy with blindness have been reported. Treatment with vinca alkaloids has resulted in both vestibular and auditory damage to the eighth cranial nerve. Manifestations include partial or total deafness which may be temporary or permanent, and difficulties with balance including dizziness, nystagmus, and vertigo. Particular caution is warranted when vincristine is used in combination with other agents known to be ototoxic such as the platinum-containing oncolytics. Pulmonary See PRECAUTIONS. Endocrine Rare occurrences of a syndrome attributable to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion have been observed in patients treated with vincristine sulfate. This syndrome is characterized by high urinary sodium excretion in the presence of hyponatremia; renal or adrenal disease, hypotension, dehydration, azotemia, and clinical edema are absent. With fluid deprivation, improvement occurs in the hyponatremia and in the renal loss of sodium. Hematologic VINCASAR PFS does not appear to have any constant or significant effect on platelets or red blood cells. Serious bone-marrow depression is usually not a major dose-limiting event. However, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. Thrombocytopenia, if present when therapy with VINCASAR PFS is begun, may actually improve before the appearance of bone marrow remission. Skin Alopecia and rash have been reported. Other Fever and headache have occurred."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with Marqibo. Marqibo is expected to interact with drugs known to interact with non-liposomal vincristine sulfate. Simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included non-liposomal vincristine sulfate have been reported to reduce blood levels of phenytoin and to increase seizure activity. Marqibo is expected to interact with drugs known to interact with non-liposomal vincristine sulfate (7). 7.1 CYP3A Interactions Vincristine sulfate, the active agent in Marqibo, is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A isozymes (CYP3A); therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin). Similarly, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort). 7.2 P-glycoprotein Interactions Vincristine sulfate, the active agent in Marqibo, is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The effect of concomitant use of potent P-gp inhibitors or inducers has not been investigated; it is likely that these agents will alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Marqibo. Therefore the concomitant use of potent P-gp inhibitors or inducers should be avoided."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Talon Therapeutics at 1-888 292 9617 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Safety Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Integrated Summary of Safety in Relapsed and/or Refractory Ph- Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Marqibo, at a dose of 2.25 mg/m2 weekly, was studied in a total of 83 patients in two trials: study 1 and study 2. Adverse reactions were observed in 100% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (>30%) were constipation (57%), nausea (52%), pyrexia (43%), fatigue (41%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), febrile neutropenia (38%), diarrhea (37%), anemia (34%), decreased appetite (33%), and insomnia (32%). Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 96% of patients. Adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater and occurring in ≥ 5% of patients are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Most Commonly Reported (> 5%) Grade National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. 3 or Greater Adverse Reactions among 83 Patients Receiving the Clinical Dosing Regimen Adverse Reactions Grade ≥ 3 Study 1 and 2 (N=83) n (%) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 47 (56.6) Febrile Neutropenia 26 (31.3) Neutropenia 15 (18.1) Anemia 14 (16.9) Thrombocytopenia 14 (16.9) Infections 33 (39.8) Pneumonia 7 (8.4) Septic Shock 5 (6.0) Staphylococcal Bacteremia 5 (6.0) NeuropathyIncluding neuropathy-associated adverse reactions. 27 (32.5) Peripheral Sensory and Motor Neuropathy 14 (16.7) Constipation 4 (4.8) Ileus, Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction 5 (6.0) Asthenia 4 (4.8) Muscular Weakness 1 (1.2) Respiratory Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders 17 (20.5) Respiratory Distress 5 (6.0) Respiratory Failure 4 (4.8) General Disorders and Administration Site Condition 31 (37.3) Pyrexia 12 (14.5) Fatigue 10 (12.0) Pain 7 (8.4) Gastrointestinal Disorders 21 (25.3) Abdominal Pain 7 (8.4) Investigations 20 (24.1) Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased 6 (7.2) Vascular Disorders 8 (9.6) Hypotension 5 (6.0) Psychiatric Disorders 9 (10.8) Mental Status Changes 3 (3.6) Cardiac Disorders 9 (10.8) Cardiac Arrest 5 (6.0) Renal and Urinary Disorders 6 (7.2) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders 7 (8.4) A total of 75.9% of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during the studies. The most commonly reported SAEs included febrile neutropenia (20.5%), pyrexia (13.3%), hypotension (7.2%), respiratory distress (6.0%), and cardiac arrest (6.0%). Dose reduction, delay, or omission occurred in 53% of patients during the treatment. Twenty-eight percent of patients experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions that caused treatment discontinuation were peripheral neuropathy (10%), leukemia-related (7%), and tumor lysis syndrome (2%). Adverse reactions related to neuropathy and leading to treatment discontinuation were decreased vibratory sense, facial palsy, hyporeflexia, constipation, asthenia, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain, each reported in at least 1 patient. Deaths occurred in 23% of patients in study 1. The non-leukemia related causes of deaths were brain infarct (1), intracerebral hemorrhage (2), liver failure (1), multi system organ failure (2), pneumonia and septic shock (3), respiratory failure (4), pulmonary hemorrhage (1), and sudden cardiac death (1)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intrathecal administration is fatal (5.1) Extravasation causes tissue injury (5.2) Neurologic toxicity: Monitor patients for peripheral motor and sensory, central and autonomic neuropathy, and reduce, interrupt, or discontinue dosing. Patients with preexisting severe neuropathy should be treated with Marqibo only after careful risk-benefit assessment (2.2, 5.3) Myelosuppression: Monitor blood counts prior to each dose of Marqibo. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia may occur; consider Marqibo dose reduction or interruption and supportive care measures (5.4) Tumor lysis syndrome: Anticipate, monitor for, and manage (5.5) Constipation, bowel obstruction, and/or paralytic ileus: Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to prevent potential constipation, bowel obstruction, and/or paralytic ileus (5.6) Fatigue: Severe fatigue can occur (5.7) Hepatic toxicity: Monitor liver function and modify or interrupt dosing (5.8) Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus (5.9, 8.1) 5.1 For Intravenous Use Only Fatal if Given by Other Routes. Death has occurred with intrathecal use. 5.2 Extravasation Tissue Injury Only administer through a secure and free-flowing venous access line. If extravasation is suspected, discontinue infusion immediately and consider local treatment measures. 5.3 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies are common and are cumulative. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, hyporeflexia, areflexia, neuralgia, jaw pain, decreased vibratory sense, cranial neuropathy, ileus, burning sensation, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle spasm, or weakness, both before and during treatment. Orthostatic hypotension may occur. The risk of neurologic toxicity is greater if Marqibo is administered to patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders or when other drugs with risk of neurologic toxicity are being given. In the studies of relapsed and/or refractory adult ALL patients, Grade ≥ 3 neuropathy events occurred in 32.5% of patients. Worsening neuropathy requires dose delay, reduction, or discontinuation of Marqibo [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.4 Myelosuppression Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Marqibo. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia develops, consider Marqibo dose modification or reduction as well as supportive care measures. 5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients with ALL receiving Marqibo. Anticipate, monitor for, and manage. 5.6 Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Ileus, bowel obstruction, and colonic pseudo-obstruction have occurred. Marqibo can cause constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction, and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners, such as docusate. Additional treatments, such as senna, bisacodyl, milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, and lactulose may be considered. 5.7 Fatigue Marqibo can cause severe fatigue. Marqibo dose delay, reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary. 5.8 Hepatic Toxicity Fatal liver toxicity and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase have occurred. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase of Grade ≥3 occurred in 6-11% of patients in clinical trials. Monitor hepatic function tests. Reduce or interrupt Marqibo for hepatic toxicity. 5.9 Embryofetal Toxicity Marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Vincristine sulfate liposome injection was teratogenic or caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Marqibo. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Marqibo in pregnant women and there were no reports of pregnancy in any of the clinical studies in the Marqibo clinical development program. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."
