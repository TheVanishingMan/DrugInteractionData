        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc., at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with Ranexa, 1,026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1,251 patients received treatment with Ranexa in open-label, long-term studies; 1,227 patients were exposed to Ranexa for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with Ranexa because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on Ranexa than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (> 4% and more common on Ranexa than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with Ranexa and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders – bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders – tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders – blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders – abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events – asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – anorexia Nervous System Disorders – syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders – confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders – hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders – dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders – hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (< 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with Ranexa than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for Ranexa, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Trials (14.2)]. Laboratory Abnormalities Ranexa produces small reductions in hemoglobin A1c. Ranexa is not a treatment for diabetes. Ranexa produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function. The elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of Ranexa, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, Ranexa 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. The elevated creatinine levels are likely due to a blockage of creatinine's tubular secretion by ranolazine or one of its metabolites. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Ranexa. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders – tremor, paresthesia, hypoesthesia Psychiatric Disorders – hallucination Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – angioedema, rash, pruritus"

Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. (5.1) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A inhibitors: Do not use Ranexa with strong CYP3A inhibitors. With moderate 3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin), limit maximum dose of Ranexa to 500 mg twice daily. (7.1) CYP3A inducers: Do not use Ranexa with CYP3A inducers. (7.1) P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): May need to lower Ranexa dose based on clinical response. (7.1) Drugs transported by P-gp or metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants): May need reduced doses of these drugs when used with Ranexa. (7.2) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Ranolazine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use Ranexa with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir. Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) increases average steady-state plasma concentrations of ranolazine 3.2-fold [see Contraindications (4)]. Limit the dose of Ranexa to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, aprepitant, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products. Diltiazem (180–360 mg daily) and verapamil (120 mg three times daily) increase ranolazine steady-state plasma concentrations about 2-fold [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Weak CYP3A inhibitors such as simvastatin (20 mg once daily) and cimetidine (400 mg three times daily) do not increase the exposure to ranolazine in healthy volunteers. P-gp Inhibitors Down-titrate Ranexa based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. CYP3A and P-gp Inducers Avoid co-administration of Ranexa and CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort. Rifampin (600 mg once daily) decreases the plasma concentration of ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily) by approximately 95% by induction of CYP3A and, probably, P-gp. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, paroxetine (20 mg once daily), increases ranolazine concentrations 1.2-fold. No dose adjustment of Ranexa is required in patients treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors. Digoxin Digoxin (0.125 mg) does not significantly alter ranolazine levels. 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that ranolazine and its O-demethylated metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A, moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6 and moderate P-gp inhibitors. Ranolazine and its most abundant metabolites are not known to inhibit the metabolism of substrates for CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2E1 in human liver microsomes, suggesting that ranolazine is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A The plasma levels of simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, and its active metabolite are each increased about 2-fold in healthy subjects receiving simvastatin (80 mg once daily) and Ranexa (1000 mg twice daily). Dose adjustments of simvastatin are not required when Ranexa is co-administered with simvastatin. The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem is not affected by ranolazine in healthy volunteers receiving diltiazem 60 mg three times daily and Ranexa 1000 mg twice daily. Drugs Transported by P-gp Ranexa (1000 mg twice daily) causes a 1.5-fold elevation of digoxin plasma concentrations. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Ranolazine or its metabolites partially inhibit CYP2D6. There are no studies of concomitant use of Ranexa with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, but lower doses of CYP2D6 substrates may be required."

In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with RANEXA in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to RANEXA for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with RANEXA because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on RANEXA than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (> 4% and more common on RANEXA than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with RANEXA and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders – bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders – tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders – blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders – abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events – asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – anorexia Nervous System Disorders – syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders – confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders – hematuria Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders – dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders – hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (< 0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with RANEXA than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for RANEXA, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Laboratory Abnormalities: RANEXA produces elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of RANEXA, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of RANEXA in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RANEXA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders – Tremor, paresthesia, abnormal coordination, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders – hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders – dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – angioedema, pruritus, rash"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. (5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue RANEXA. (5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks IKr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, there is little experience with high doses (> 1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] < 30 mL/min) while taking RANEXA. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue RANEXA and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily. ( ) 7.1 P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response. ( ) 7.1 CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with RANEXA. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with RANEXA. ( ) 7.2 OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( ) 7.2 Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with RANEXA. ( ) 7.2 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ranolazine Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Do not use RANEXA with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir . [see , ] Contraindications (4) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Limit the dose of RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products [see , ]. Dosage and Administration (2.2) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use of RANEXA and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations. Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine [see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.2) CYP3A Inducers Do not use RANEXA with CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort . [see , ] Contraindications (4) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 7.2 Effects of Ranolazine on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of RANEXA to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as RANEXA may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Drugs Transported by P-gp Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with RANEXA, and lower doses of these drugs may be required. Drugs Transported by OCT2 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with RANEXA 500 mg twice daily [see ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)"
