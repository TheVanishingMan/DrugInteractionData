        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Cytopenias [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Infusion Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Immunosuppression/Infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] The most common adverse reactions with Campath are: infusion reactions (pyrexia, chills, hypotension, urticaria, nausea, rash, tachycardia, dyspnea), cytopenias (neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), infections (CMV viremia, CMV infection, other infections), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal pain), and neurological symptoms (insomnia, anxiety). The most common serious adverse reactions are cytopenias, infusion reactions, and immunosuppression/infections. Most common adverse reactions (>= 10%): cytopenias, infusion reactions, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other infections, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and insomnia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1-877-4-CAMPATH (1-877-422-6728) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below reflect exposure to Campath in 296 patients with CLL of whom 147 were previously untreated and 149 received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The median duration of exposure was 11.7 weeks for previously untreated patients and 8 weeks for previously treated patients. Lymphopenia: Severe lymphopenia and a rapid and sustained decrease in lymphocyte subsets occurred in previously untreated and previously treated patients following administration of Campath. In previously untreated patients, the median CD4+ was 0 cells/μL at one month after treatment and 238 cells/μL [25-75% interquartile range 115 to 418 cells/μL at 6 months post-treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] . Neutropenia: In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 42% with a median time to onset of 31 days and a median duration of 37 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 64% with a median duration of 28 days. Ten percent of previously untreated patients and 17% of previously treated patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factors. Anemia: In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anemia was 12% with a median time to onset of 31 days and a median duration of 8 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anemia was 38%. Seventeen percent of previously untreated patients and 66% of previously treated patients received either erythropoiesis stimulating agents, transfusions or both. Thrombocytopenia: In previously untreated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 14% with a median time to onset of 9 days and a median duration of 14 days. In previously treated patients, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 52% with a median duration of 21 days. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia was reported in 2% of previously treated patients with one fatality. Infusion reactions: Infusion reactions, which included pyrexia, chills, hypotension, urticaria, and dyspnea, were common. Grade 3 and 4 pyrexia and/or chills occurred in approximately 10% of previously untreated patients and in approximately 35% of previously treated patients. The occurrence of infusion reactions was greatest during the initial week of treatment and decreased with subsequent doses of Campath. All patients were pretreated with antipyretics and antihistamines; additionally, 43% of previously untreated patients received glucocorticoid pre-treatment. Infections: In the study of previously untreated patients, patients were tested weekly for CMV using a PCR assay from initiation through completion of therapy, and every 2 weeks for the first 2 months following therapy. CMV infection occurred in 16% (23/147) of previously untreated patients; approximately one-third of these infections were serious or life threatening. In studies of previously treated patients in which routine CMV surveillance was not required, CMV infection was documented in 6% (9/149) of patients; nearly all of these infections were serious or life threatening. Other infections were reported in approximately 50% of patients across all studies. Grade 3 - 5 sepsis ranged from 3% to 10% across studies and was higher in previously treated patients. Grade 3 - 4 febrile neutropenia ranged from 5 to 10% across studies and was higher in previously treated patients. Infection-related fatalities occurred in 2% of previously untreated patients and 16% of previously treated patients. There were 198 episodes of other infection in 109 previously untreated patients; 16% were bacterial, 7% were fungal, 4% were other viral, and in 73%, the organism was not identified. Cardiac: Cardiac dysrhythmias occurred in approximately 14% of previously untreated patients. The majority were tachycardias and were temporally associated with infusion; dysrhythmias were Grade 3 or 4 in 1% of patients. Previously Untreated Patients Table 1 contains selected adverse reactions observed in 294 patients randomized (1:1) to receive Campath or chlorambucil as first line therapy for B-CLL. Campath was administered at a dose of 30 mg intravenously three times weekly for up to 12 weeks. The median duration of therapy was 11.7 weeks with a median weekly dose of 82 mg (25-75% interquartile range: 69 mg - 90 mg).

Adverse reactions in these studies not listed in Table 1 that occurred at an incidence rate of > 5% were fatigue, nausea, emesis, musculoskeletal pain, anorexia, dysesthesia, mucositis, and bronchospasm. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Using an ELISA assay, anti-human antibodies (HAHA) were detected in 11 of 133 (8.3%) previously untreated patients. In addition, two patients were weakly positive for neutralizing activity. Limited data suggest that the anti-Campath antibodies did not adversely affect tumor response. Four of 211 (1.9%) previously-treated patients were found to have antibodies to Campath following treatment. The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Campath with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of Campath. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Campath exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) reported frequency of the reaction, or (3) strength of causal connection to Campath. Fatal infusion reactions: [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] . Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure,cardiomyopathy, decreased ejection fraction (some patients had been previously treated with cardiotoxic agents). Immune disorders: Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, aplastic anemia, Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, serum sickness, fatal transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease. Infections: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), re-activation of latent viruses. Metabolic: tumor lysis syndrome Neurologic: optic neuropathy",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cytopenias: Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts at weekly intervals during therapy and CD4 counts after therapy until recovery to >= 200 cells/µL (5.4). Discontinue for autoimmune or severe hematologic adverse reactions (5.1). Infections: Campath induces severe and prolonged lymphopenia and increases risk of infection. If a serious infection occurs, withhold treatment until infection resolves (5.3). Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received Campath (5.5). 5.1 Cytopenias Severe, including fatal, autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia, and prolonged myelosuppression have been reported in patients receiving Campath. In addition, hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, bone marrow aplasia, and hypoplasia have been reported after treatment with Campath at the recommended dose. Single doses of Campath greater than 30 mg or cumulative doses greater than 90 mg per week increase the incidence of pancytopenia. Withhold Campath for severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia). Discontinue for autoimmune cytopenias or recurrent/persistent severe cytopenias (except lymphopenia) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)] . No data exist on the safety of Campath resumption in patients with autoimmune cytopenias or marrow aplasia [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] . 5.2 Infusion Reactions Adverse reactions occurring during or shortly after Campath infusion include pyrexia, chills/rigors, nausea, hypotension, urticaria, dyspnea, rash, emesis, and bronchospasm. In clinical trials, the frequency of infusion reactions was highest in the first week of treatment. Monitor for the signs and symptoms listed above and withhold infusion for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] . The following serious, including fatal, infusion reactions have been identified in post-marketing reports: syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, acute cardiac insufficiency, cardiac arrest, angioedema, and anaphylactoid shock. Initiate Campath according to the recommended dose-escalation scheme [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)] . Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to dosing. Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, meperidine) for infusion reactions as needed [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)] . If therapy is interrupted for 7 or more days, reinstitute Campath with gradual dose escalation [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] . 5.3 Immunosuppression/Infections Campath treatment results in severe and prolonged lymphopenia with a concomitant increased incidence of opportunistic infections [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] . Administer PCP and herpes viral prophylaxis during Campath therapy and for a minimum of 2 months after completion of Campath or until the CD4+ count is >= 200 cells/µL, whichever occurs later [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2)] . Prophylaxis does not eliminate these infections. Routinely monitor patients for CMV infection during Campath treatment and for at least 2 months following completion of treatment. Withhold Campath for serious infections and during antiviral treatment for CMV infection or confirmed CMV viremia (defined as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive CMV in >= 2 consecutive samples obtained 1 week apart) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] . Initiate therapeutic ganciclovir (or equivalent) for CMV infection or confirmed CMV viremia [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)] . Administer only irradiated blood products to avoid transfusion associated Graft versus Host Disease (TAGVHD), unless emergent circumstances dictate immediate transfusion.1 In patients receiving Campath as initial therapy, recovery of CD4+ counts to >= 200 cells/µL occurred by 6 months post-treatment; however at 2 months post-treatment, the median was 183 cells/µL. In previously treated patients receiving Campath, the median time to recovery of CD4+ counts to >= 200 cells/µL was 2 months; however, full recovery (to baseline) of CD4+ and CD8+ counts may take more than 12 months [see BOXED WARNING and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] . 5.4 Laboratory Monitoring Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at weekly intervals during Campath therapy and more frequently if worsening anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia occurs. Assess CD4+ counts after treatment until recovery to >= 200 cells/µL [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)] . 5.5 Immunization The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following Campath therapy has not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received Campath. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following Campath therapy has not been studied.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Autoimmunity [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Infusion reactions [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Immune Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Glomerular Nephropathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Thyroid Disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Other Autoimmune Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 10% and > interferon beta-1a): rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, urticaria, pruritus, thyroid gland disorders, fungal infection, arthralgia, pain in extremity, back pain, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1-800-745-4447 (option 2) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2), a total of 811 patients with relapsing forms of MS received LEMTRADA. A total of 811 patients received 1 course of therapy, and 789 patients received a second course of therapy at 12 months. The overall follow-up in the controlled trials was equivalent to 1622 patient years, with an additional 3411 person-years of follow-up in an open label extension study. The population was 18-55 years of age, 65% were female, and 92% were Caucasian. Most Common Adverse Reactions In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with LEMTRADA (in at least 10% of patients and more frequently than in interferon beta-1a) were rash, headache, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, urticaria, pruritus, thyroid gland disorders, fungal infection, arthralgia, pain in extremity, back pain, diarrhea, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, paresthesia, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing, and vomiting. Table 1 lists adverse reactions occurring in >=5% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in Study 1 and 2 and at the same or at a higher rate than interferon beta-1a. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in the Pooled 2-Year Active-Controlled Studies in Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis LEMTRADA (N=811) % interferon beta-1a 44 mcg (N=389) % Rash 53 6 Headache 52 23 Pyrexia 29 9 Nasopharyngitis 25 19 Nausea 21 9 Urinary tract infection 19 8 Fatigue 18 13 Insomnia 16 15 Upper respiratory tract infection 16 13 Herpes viral infection 16 3 Urticaria 16 2 Pruritus 14 2 Thyroid gland disorders 13 3 Fungal infection 13 4 Arthralgia 12 9 Pain in extremity 12 9 Back pain 12 8 Diarrhea 12 6 Sinusitis 11 8 Oropharyngeal pain 11 5 Paresthesia 10 8 Dizziness 10 5 Abdominal pain 10 5 Flushing 10 4 Vomiting 10 3 Cough 9 4 Chills 9 3 Dysgeusia 8 7 Influenza 8 6 Dermatitis 8 5 Dyspepsia 8 4 Blood in urine 8 3 Dyspnea 8 1 Tachycardia 8 1 Anxiety 7 6 Muscular weakness 7 6 Bronchitis 7 4 Chest discomfort 7 2 Muscle spasms 6 5 Myalgia 6 5 Decrease in CD4 lymphocytes 6 2 Decrease in CD8 lymphocytes 6 2 Asthenia 5 4 Decrease in T-lymphocyte count 5 3 Erythema 5 2 Peripheral edema 5 2 Epistaxis 5 2 Neck Pain 5 2 Abnormal uterine bleeding 5 1 6.2 Lymphopenia Nearly all (99.9%) patients treated with LEMTRADA in MS clinical trials experienced lymphopenia. The lowest lymphocyte counts occurred approximately by 1 month after each course of treatment. The mean lymphocyte count at 1 month after LEMTRADA treatment was 0.25 × 109L (range 0.02-2.30 × 109L) and 0.32 (0.02-1.81 × 109L) for treatment courses 1 and 2, respectively. Total lymphocyte counts increased to reach the lower limit of normal in approximately 40% of patients by 6 months after each LEMTRADA treatment course and approximately 80% of patients by 12 months after each course [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 6.3 Suicidal Behavior or Ideation In clinical studies, 0.6% of patients in both the LEMTRADA and interferon beta-1a groups had events of attempted suicide or suicidal ideation. There were no completed suicides in either clinical study treatment group. Suicidal behavior or ideation occurred in patients with or without a history of a psychiatric or thyroid disorder. Advise patients to report immediately any symptoms of depression or suicidal ideation to the prescribing physician. 6.4 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a competitive binding assay, anti-alemtuzumab binding antibodies were detected in 62%, 67%, and 29% of LEMTRADA-treated patients, at months 1, 3, 12 (Course 1) as well as 83%, 83%, and 75% of LEMTRADA-treated patients at months 13, 15, and 24 (Course 2). Samples that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for evidence of in vitro inhibition using a flow cytometry assay. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 87%, 46%, and 5% of positive binding antibody patients at months 1, 3, 12 (Course 1) as well as 94%, 88%, and 42% of positive binding antibody patients at months 13, 15, and 24 (Course 2). Anti-alemtuzumab antibodies were associated with decreased alemtuzumab concentration during Course 2 but not Course 1. There was no evidence from clinical trials that the presence of binding or inhibitory anti-alemtuzumab antibodies had a significant effect on clinical outcomes, total lymphocyte count, or adverse events. The incidence of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including inhibitory antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to LEMTRADA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.5 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, not described elsewhere, were identified during post-approval use of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH) for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), as well as for the treatment of other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses (e.g., 30 mg) than that recommended in the treatment of MS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and decreased ejection fraction in non-MS patients previously treated with potentially cardiotoxic agents."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thyroid Disorders: Obtain thyroid function tests prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months until 48 months after the last infusion. (5.7) Other Autoimmune Cytopenias: Monitor complete blood counts monthly until 48 months after the last infusion. (5.8) Consider delaying initiation of LEMTRADA in patients with active infections until the infection is fully controlled. Do not administer live viral vaccines following a course of LEMTRADA. (5.9) 5.1 Autoimmunity Treatment with LEMTRADA can result in the formation of autoantibodies and increase the risk of serious autoimmune mediated conditions. In clinical studies LEMTRADA-treated patients experienced thyroid disorders (34%), immune thrombocytopenia (2%), and glomerular nephropathies (0.3%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.7)]. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune pancytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], undifferentiated connective tissue disorders, and acquired hemophilia A (anti-Factor VIII antibodies) each occurred in 0.2% of patients. Rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, vitiligo, and retinal pigment epitheliopathy occurred in 0.1% of patients. During postmarketing use, additional autoimmune events including Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy have been reported in the treatment of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), as well as other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses than recommended in MS. An oncology patient treated with alemtuzumab had fatal transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Autoantibodies may be transferred from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy. A case of transplacental transfer of anti-thyrotropin receptor antibodies resulting in neonatal Graves' disease occurred after alemtuzumab treatment in the mother [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. LEMTRADA may increase the risk of other autoimmune conditions because of the broad range of autoantibody formation with LEMTRADA. Monitor complete blood counts with differential, serum creatinine levels, and urinalysis with urine cell counts before starting treatment and then at monthly intervals for 48 months after the last dose of LEMTRADA to allow for early detection and treatment of autoimmune adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. After 48 months, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of autoimmunity. LEMTRADA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 5.2 Infusion Reactions LEMTRADA causes cytokine release syndrome resulting in infusion reactions, some of which may be serious and life threatening. In clinical studies, 92% of LEMTRADA-treated patients experienced infusion reactions. In some patients, infusion reactions were reported more than 24 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Serious reactions occurred in 3% of patients and included anaphylaxis in 2 patients (including anaphylactic shock), angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, chest pain, bradycardia, tachycardia (including atrial fibrillation), transient neurologic symptoms, hypertension, headache, pyrexia, and rash. Other infusion reactions included nausea, urticaria, pruritus, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, dizziness, and pain. In clinical studies, 0.6% of patients with infusion reactions received epinephrine or atropine. During postmarketing use, other serious and sometimes fatal infusion reactions included hypoxia, syncope, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory arrest, myocardial infarction, acute cardiac insufficiency, and cardiac arrest have been reported in the treatment of patients with B-CLL, as well as other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses than recommended in MS. Premedicate patients with corticosteroids immediately prior to LEMTRADA infusion for the first 3 days of each treatment course. In clinical trials, patients received 1,000 mg of methylprednisolone for the first 3 days of each LEMTRADA treatment course. Consider pretreatment with antihistamines and/or antipyretics prior to LEMTRADA administration. Infusion reactions may occur despite pretreatment. Consider additional monitoring in patients with medical conditions which predispose them to cardiovascular or pulmonary compromise. LEMTRADA can only be administered in certified healthcare settings that have on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to manage infusion reactions (including anaphylaxis and cardiac and respiratory emergencies). LEMTRADA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 5.3 Malignancies Thyroid cancer LEMTRADA may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. In controlled clinical studies, 3 of 919 (0.3%) LEMTRADA-treated patients developed thyroid cancer, compared to none in the interferon beta-1a-treated group. However, screening for thyroid cancer was performed more frequently in the LEMTRADA-treated group, because of the higher incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders in those patients. Two additional cases of thyroid cancer in LEMTRADA-treated patients occurred in uncontrolled studies. Patients and healthcare providers should monitor for symptoms of thyroid cancer including a new lump or swelling in the neck, pain in the front of the neck, persistent hoarseness or other voice changes, trouble swallowing or breathing, or a constant cough not due to an upper respiratory tract infection. Melanoma LEMTRADA may increase the risk of melanoma. In uncontrolled studies, 4 of 1486 (0.3%) LEMTRADA-treated patients developed melanoma or melanoma in situ. One of those patients had evidence of locally advanced disease. Perform baseline and yearly skin examinations to monitor for melanoma in patients receiving LEMTRADA. Lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoma Cases of lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoma have occurred in LEMTRADA-treated patients with MS, including a MALT lymphoma, Castleman's Disease, and a fatality following treatment of non-Epstein Barr Virus-associated Burkitt's lymphoma. There are postmarketing reports of Epstein Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders in non-MS patients. Because LEMTRADA is an immunomodulatory therapy, caution should also be exercised in initiating LEMTRADA in patients with pre-existing or ongoing malignancies. LEMTRADA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 5.4 LEMTRADA REMS Program LEMTRADA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the LEMTRADA REMS Program, because of the risks of autoimmunity, infusion reactions, and malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)]. Notable requirements of the LEMTRADA REMS Program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. Patients must enroll in the program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to certified healthcare facilities that are authorized to receive LEMTRADA. Healthcare facilities must enroll in the program and verify that patients are authorized before infusing LEMTRADA. Healthcare facilities must have on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to manage infusion reactions. Further information, including a list of qualified healthcare facilities, is available at 1-855-676-6326. 5.5 Immune Thrombocytopenia Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurred in 2% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies in MS. In a controlled clinical trial in patients with MS, one LEMTRADA-treated patient developed ITP that went unrecognized prior to the implementation of monthly blood monitoring requirements, and died from intracerebral hemorrhage. Nadir platelet counts <=20,000 cells per microliter as a result of ITP occurred in 2% of all LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies in MS. Anti-platelet antibodies did not precede ITP onset. ITP has been diagnosed more than 3 years after the last LEMTRADA dose. Symptoms of ITP include easy bruising, petechiae, spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, hemoptysis), and heavier than normal or irregular menstrual bleeding. Hemoptysis may also be indicative of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. Remind the patient to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. Obtain complete blood counts (CBCs) with differential prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP is suspected, a complete blood count should be obtained immediately. If ITP onset is confirmed, promptly initiate appropriate medical intervention. 5.6 Glomerular Nephropathies Glomerular nephropathies occurred in 0.3% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in MS clinical trials. There were 3 cases of membranous glomerulonephritis and 2 cases of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease. There are published and post-marketing cases of MS patients treated with alemtuzumab who developed anti-GBM disease and subsequently developed end stage renal disease requiring renal transplantation. Cases of anti-GBM disease have been diagnosed up to 40 months after the last dose of LEMTRADA. Urgent evaluation and treatment is required because anti-GBM disease can lead to renal failure requiring dialysis or transplantation and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Clinical manifestations of nephropathy may include elevated serum creatinine levels, hematuria, or proteinuria. Alveolar hemorrhage manifested as hemoptysis is a common component of anti-GBM disease but did not occur in clinical trials. Obtain serum creatinine levels and urinalysis with cell counts prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of nephropathies. If clinically significant changes from baseline in serum creatinine, unexplained hematuria, or proteinuria are observed, perform further evaluation for nephropathies. Early detection and treatment of nephropathies may decrease the risk of poor outcomes. 5.7 Thyroid Disorders Autoimmune thyroid disorders occurred in 34% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies. Newly diagnosed thyroid disorders occurred throughout the uncontrolled clinical study follow-up period, more than 7 years after the first LEMTRADA dose. Autoimmune thyroid disorders included Graves' disease, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Graves' ophthalmopathy with decreased vision, eye pain, and exophthalmos occurred in 1% of LEMTRADA-treated patients. Two patients required surgical orbital decompression. Serious thyroid events occurred in about 2% of LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies and included cardiac and psychiatric events associated with thyroid disease. Of all LEMTRADA-treated patients, 3% underwent thyroidectomy. Thyroid disease poses special risks in women who are pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Obtain thyroid function tests, such as TSH levels, prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion. Continue to test thyroid function after 48 months if clinically indicated. In patients with ongoing thyroid disorder, LEMTRADA should be administered only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. 5.8 Other Autoimmune Cytopenias Autoimmune cytopenias such as neutropenia (0.1%), hemolytic anemia (0.2%), and pancytopenia (0.2%) occurred in LEMTRADA-treated patients in clinical studies in MS. In cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, patients tested positive for direct antiglobulin antibodies, and nadir hemoglobin levels ranged from 2.9-8.6 g/dL. Symptoms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia include weakness, chest pain, jaundice, dark urine, and tachycardia. One LEMTRADA-treated patient with autoimmune pancytopenia died from sepsis. During postmarketing use, additional autoimmune cytopenias including fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia have been reported in the treatment of patients with B-CLL, as well as other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses than recommended in MS. Use CBC results to monitor for cytopenias. Prompt medical intervention is indicated if a cytopenia is confirmed. 5.9 Infections Infections occurred in 71% of LEMTRADA-treated patients compared to 53% of patients treated with interferon beta-1a in controlled clinical trials in MS up to 2 years in duration. Infections that occurred more often in LEMTRADA-treated patients than interferon beta-1a patients included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, herpetic infections, influenza, and bronchitis. Serious infections occurred in 3% of patients treated with LEMTRADA as compared to 1% of patients treated with interferon beta-1a. Serious infections in the LEMTRADA group included: appendicitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, herpes zoster, and tooth infection. Do not administer live viral vaccines following a course of LEMTRADA. Patients treated with LEMTRADA have altered immunity and may be at increased risk of infection following administration of live viral vaccines. Consider delaying LEMTRADA administration in patients with active infection until the infection is fully controlled. Concomitant use of LEMTRADA with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. Herpes Viral Infections In controlled clinical trials, 16% of LEMTRADA-treated patients developed a herpes viral infection compared to 3% of interferon beta-1a patients. These events included oral herpes (8.8%), herpes zoster (4.2%), herpes simplex (1.8%), and genital herpes (1.3%). Serious herpetic infections in LEMTRADA-treated patients included primary varicella (0.1%), herpes zoster (0.2%), and herpes meningitis (0.1%). Administer antiviral agents for herpetic prophylaxis at appropriate suppressive dosing regimens. Administer anti-viral prophylaxis for herpetic viral infections starting on the first day of each treatment course and continue for a minimum of two months following treatment with LEMTRADA or until the CD4+ lymphocyte count is >= 200 cells per microliter, whichever occurs later [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Human Papilloma Virus Cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including cervical dysplasia, occurred in 2% of LEMTRADA-treated patients. Annual HPV screening is recommended for female patients. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis occurred in patients treated with LEMTRADA and interferon beta-1a in controlled clinical trials. Active and latent tuberculosis cases occurred in 0.3% of LEMTRADA-treated patients, most often in endemic regions. Perform tuberculosis screening according to local guidelines prior to initiation of LEMTRADA. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with LEMTRADA. Fungal Infections Fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis, occurred more commonly in LEMTRADA-treated patients (12%) than in patients treated with interferon beta-1a (3%) in controlled clinical trials in MS. Listeria Infections Listeria meningitis has been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Cases of listeria meningitis occurred within 1 month of alemtuzumab dosing. The duration of increased risk for listeria meningitis is unclear. Patients should avoid or adequately heat foods that are potential sources of Listeria monocytogenes. Infections in non-MS patients During postmarketing use, serious and sometimes fatal viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal infections, including some due to reactivation of latent infections, have been reported in the treatment of patients with B-CLL, as well as other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses than recommended in MS. Hepatitis No data are available on the association of LEMTRADA with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation because patients with evidence of active or chronic infections were excluded from the clinical trials. Consider screening patients at high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before initiation of LEMTRADA and exercise caution in prescribing LEMTRADA to patients identified as carriers of HBV and/or HCV as these patients may be at risk of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential virus reactivation as a consequence of their pre-existing status. 5.10 Pneumonitis In clinical studies, 6 of 1217 (0.5%) LEMTRADA-treated patients had pneumonitis of varying severity. Cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pneumonitis with fibrosis occurred in clinical studies. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of pneumonitis, which include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness, and hemoptysis. 5.11 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient LEMTRADA contains the same active ingredient (alemtuzumab) found in CAMPATH(R). If LEMTRADA is considered for use in a patient who has previously received CAMPATH, exercise increased vigilance for additive and long-lasting effects on the immune system."
