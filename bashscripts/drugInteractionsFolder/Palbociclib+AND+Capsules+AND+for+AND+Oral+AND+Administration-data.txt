        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. In vivo, palbociclib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concurrent use of IBRANCE with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If the strong inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the IBRANCE dose. (2.2, 7.1) CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concurrent use of IBRANCE with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. (7.2) CYP3A Substrates: The dose of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices may need to be reduced when given concurrently with IBRANCE. (7.3) 7.1 Agents That May Increase Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) increased the plasma exposure of palbociclib in healthy subjects by 87%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, and voriconazole). Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during IBRANCE treatment. If coadministration of IBRANCE with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IBRANCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Agents That May Decrease Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations Effect of CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of palbociclib in healthy subjects by 85%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine and St John's Wort) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of moderate CYP3A inducers may also decrease the plasma exposure of IBRANCE. Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Palbociclib Coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE increased the midazolam plasma exposure by 61%, in healthy subjects, compared with administration of midazolam alone. The dose of the sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus) may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following topics are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, anemia, upper respiratory infection, nausea, stomatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, asthenia, peripheral neuropathy, and epistaxis. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer, Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus letrozole alone was evaluated in Study 1. The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 83 out of 160 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of treatment in Study 1. The median duration of treatment for palbociclib was 13.8 months while the median duration of treatment for letrozole on the letrozole-alone arm was 7.6 months. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in Study 1. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7 of 83 (8%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 2 of 77 (3%) patients receiving letrozole alone. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole included neutropenia (6%), asthenia (1%), and fatigue (1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole arm were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, anemia, upper respiratory infection, nausea, stomatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, asthenia, peripheral neuropathy, and epistaxis. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (3 of 83; 4%) and diarrhea (2 of 83; 2%). An increase incidence of infections events was observed in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (55%) compared to the letrozole alone arm (34%). Febrile neutropenia events have been reported in the IBRANCE clinical program, although no cases were observed in Study 1. Grade ≥3 neutropenia was managed by dose reductions and/or dose delay or temporary discontinuation consistent with a permanent discontinuation rate of 6% due to neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hematologic: Neutropenia may occur. Monitor complete blood count prior to start of IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 14 of the first two cycles, and as clinically indicated. (5.1) Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms and withhold dosing as appropriate. (5.2) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Neutropenia Decreased neutrophil counts have been observed in clinical trials with IBRANCE. Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in the randomized clinical trial (Study 1). Median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia per laboratory data was 15 days (13–117 days). Median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Febrile neutropenia events have been reported in the IBRANCE clinical program, although no cases of febrile neutropenia have been observed in Study 1. Monitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 14 of the first two cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Infections Infections have been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole compared to patients treated with letrozole alone in Study 1. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 5% of patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole whereas no patients treated with letrozole alone experienced a Grade 3 or 4 infection. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate. 5.3 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole (5%) compared with no cases in patients treated with letrozole alone in Study 1. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm. IBRANCE caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were greater than or equal to 4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with IBRANCE and for at least two weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."

Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.3, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Neutropenia Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in both Study 1 (75%) and Study 2 (83%). A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil counts was reported in 62% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1 and 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in Study 2. In Study 1 and 2, the median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 14 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in Study 2. Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.2 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in Study 2 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were ≥4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."
