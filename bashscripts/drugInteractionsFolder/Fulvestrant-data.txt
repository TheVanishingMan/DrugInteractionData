        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no known drug-drug interactions. Although, fulvestrant is metabolized by CYP 3A4 in vitro, drug interactions studies with ketoconazole or rifampin did not alter fulvestrant pharmacokinetics. Dose adjustment is not needed in patients co-prescribed CYP 3A4 inhibitors or inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. -There are no known drug-drug interactions. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: -Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -The most common adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of patients receiving FASLODEX 500 mg were: injection site pain, nausea, bone pain, arthralgia, headache, back pain, fatigue, pain in extremity, hot flash, vomiting, anorexia, asthenia, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and constipation. (6.1) -Increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) occurred in >15% of FASLODEX patients and were not dose-dependent. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Monotherapy Comparison of FASLODEX 500 mg and FASLODEX 250 mg The following adverse reactions (ARs) were calculated based on the safety analysis of Study 1 comparing the administration of FASLODEX 500 mg intramuscularly once a month with FASLODEX 250 mg intramuscularly once a month. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the fulvestrant 500 mg group were injection site pain (11.6% of patients), nausea (9.7% of patients) and bone pain (9.4% of patients); the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the fulvestrant 250 mg group were nausea (13.6% of patients), back pain (10.7% of patients) and injection site pain (9.1% of patients). Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% or greater, regardless of assessed causality, from Study 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Study 1 (>=5% in Either Treatment Group) Body System and Adverse Reaction Number (%) of Patients Fulvestrant 500 mg N=361 Fulvestrant 250 mg N=374 Body as a Whole Injection Site Pain 42 (11.6) 34 (9.1) Headache 28 (7.8) 25 (6.7) Back Pain 27 (7.5) 40 (10.7) Fatigue 27 (7.5) 24 (6.4) Pain in Extremity 25 (6.9) 26 (7.0) Asthenia 21 (5.8) 23 (6.1) Vascular System Hot Flash 24 (6.6) 22 (5.9) Digestive System Nausea 35 (9.7) 51 (13.6) Vomiting 22 (6.1) 21 (5.6) Anorexia 22 (6.1) 14 (3.7) Constipation 18 (5.0) 13 (3.5) Musculoskeletal System Bone Pain 34 (9.4) 28 (7.5) Arthralgia 29 (8.0) 29 (7.8) Musculoskeletal Pain 20 (5.5) 12 (3.2) Respiratory System Cough 19 (5.3) 20 (5.3) Dyspnea 16 (4.4) 19 (5.1) In the pooled safety population (N=1127) from clinical trials comparing FASLODEX 500 mg to FASLODEX 250 mg, post-baseline increases of >=1 CTC grade in either AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase were observed in >15% of patients receiving FASLODEX. Grade 3-4 increases were observed in 1-2% of patients. The incidence and severity of increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) did not differ between the 250 mg and the 500 mg FASLODEX arms. Comparison of FASLODEX 250 mg and Anastrozole 1 mg in Combined Trials (Studies 2 and 3) The most commonly reported adverse reactions in the FASLODEX and anastrozole treatment groups were gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain), headache, back pain, vasodilatation (hot flashes), and pharyngitis. Injection site reactions with mild transient pain and inflammation were seen with FASLODEX and occurred in 7% of patients (1% of treatments) given the single 5 mL injection (predominantly European Trial Study 3) and in 27% of patients (4.6% of treatments) given the 2 x 2.5 mL injections (North American Trial Study 2). Table 2 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% or greater, regardless of assessed causality, from the two controlled clinical trials comparing the administration of FASLODEX 250 mg intramuscularly once a month with anastrozole 1 mg orally once a day.

The data described below reflect exposure to FASLODEX plus palbociclib in 345 out of 517 patients with HR- positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of treatment in Study 4. No dose reduction was allowed for FASLODEX in Study 4. Dose reductions of palbociclib due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 345 (6%) patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib, and in 6 of 172 (3%) patients receiving FASLODEX plus placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%). The most common adverse reactions (>=10%) of any grade reported in patients in the FASLODEX plus palbociclib arm were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anemia, stomatitis, headache, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, vomiting, alopecia, rash, decreased appetite, and pyrexia. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving FASLODEX plus palbociclib were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%). Adverse reactions reported in patients who received FASLODEX plus palbociclib in Study 4 are listed in Table 3, and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 4.

Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently (<1%), mainly in patients during the first 6 weeks after changing from existing hormonal therapy to treatment with FASLODEX. If bleeding persists, further evaluation should be considered. Elevation of bilirubin, elevation of gamma GT, hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported infrequently (<1%)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Risk of Bleeding: Use with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use. (5.1) -Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Use a 250 mg dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (2.2, 5.2, 8.6) -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.3, 8.1, 8.3) -Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol: FASLODEX can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels. (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Because FASLODEX is administered intramuscularly, it should be used with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use. 5.2 Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of FASLODEX were evaluated in a study in seven subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and seven subjects with normal hepatic function. Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, therefore a dose of 250 mg is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. FASLODEX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, FASLODEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at daily doses that are significantly less than the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FASLODEX and for one year after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. 5.4 Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol Due to structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, FASLODEX can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels."
