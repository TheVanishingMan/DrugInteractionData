In clinical trials, a total of 443 adult subjects with atopic dermatitis or plaque-type psoriasis were treated once daily or twice daily with fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% for 2 weeks.

Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity. Nervous System Disorders: headache and dizziness. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: acne, dry skin, rash, skin exfoliation and skin tightness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% has been shown to suppress the HPA axis. Systemic absorption of fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% may produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia and unmask latent diabetes (5.1) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression (5.1) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop (5.1) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption (5.3) Local adverse reactions with topical steroids may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids (5.3) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) 5.1 Effect on Endocrine System Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1%, can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. In addition, the use of fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. HPA axis suppression has been observed with fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% applied once or twice daily in 2 out of 18 adult patients with plaque-type psoriasis, 1 out of 31 adult patients with atopic dermatitis and 4 out of 123 pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [see Use in Specific Population (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1%, may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Studies conducted in pediatric patients demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1%. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% due to their larger skin surface-to-body-mass ratios [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasis, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, fluocinonide cream USP, 0.1% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing."

Studies conducted in pediatric patients demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of fluocinonide cream. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of fluocinonide cream due to their larger skin surface-to-body-mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasis, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of fluocinonide cream should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, fluocinonide cream should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing."

Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing."
