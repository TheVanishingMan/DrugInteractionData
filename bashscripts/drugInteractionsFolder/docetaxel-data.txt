        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2 fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with docetaxel, close monitoring for toxicity and a docetaxel dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. •Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: •Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions ( 5.1 )] •Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] •Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] •Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] •Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] •Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Cutaneous Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Eye Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] •Asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] •Alcohol Intoxication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (see Table 3 ).

The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 with fever > 38oC with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT > 1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5 ).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6 ). Table 6 - Clinically Important Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Regardless of Causal Relationship in Patients Receiving Docetaxel in Combination with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAX316).

Of the 744 patients treated with TAC, 36.3% experienced severe treatment emergent adverse reactions compared to 26.6% of the 736 patients treated with FAC. Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7 . Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Cases of permanent alopecia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with preexisting liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) •Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) •Neurologic reactions: Reactions including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) •Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) •Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) •Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.11) •Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving docetaxel (5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN together with AP > 2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level > 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (< 2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel should not be administered to patients with neutrophils < 1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin > 1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with docetaxel. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with preexisting effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g., paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in docetaxel injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of docetaxel injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 1.975 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 3.95 grams of ethanol [see Description (11 )]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel. If docetaxel is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with docetaxel [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. ( 7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Cutaneous Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Eye Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Alcohol Intoxication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar RxLLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m 2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m 2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 4).

The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values > the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m 2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 5 and 6).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m 2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m 2 and 100 mg/m 2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m 2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m 2 and 100 mg/m 2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m 2, 75 mg/m 2, and 100 mg/m 2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 7).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 8. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel + carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] ) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel + carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Prostate Cancer Combination therapy with docetaxel in patients with prostate cancer The following data are based on the experience of 332 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (see Table 10).

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Cases of permanent alopecia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic:conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia ( 5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment ( 5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. ( 5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. ( 5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. ( 5.10) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. ( 5.11) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection ( 5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m 2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m 2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m 2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m 2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm 3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm 3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm 3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m 2 to 100 mg/m 2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m 2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m 2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm 3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m 2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m 2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)] 5.4 Hypersensitivity reaction Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m 2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m 2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel Injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. For One-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate) Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m 2 delivers 1.975 g/m 2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m 2, this would deliver 3.95 grams of ethanol [ see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection Concentrate and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection Concentrate, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection Concentrate dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel injection concentrate are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection concentrate indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection concentrate indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with Docetaxel injection concentrate for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel injection concentrate 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel injection concentrate administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel injection concentrate. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel Injection Concentrate at 100 mg/m2 All Tumor Types All Tumor Types Breast Cancer Normal LFTs* Elevated LFTs** Normal LFTs* Adverse Reaction n=2045 n=61 n=965 % % % *Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN **Elevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN ***Febrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile Neutropenia*** 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel injection concentrate infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel injection concentrate, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel injection concentrate at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel injection concentrate at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel injection concentrate in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel injection concentrate 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with Docetaxel injection concentrate for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel injection concentrate 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel injection concentrate+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel injection concentrate, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel injection concentrate+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel injection concentrate when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel injection concentrate. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel injection concentrate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving docetaxel injection concentrate. (5.11, 8.1) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection concentrate may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel injection concentrate administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel injection concentrate administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection Concentrate [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel injection concentrate until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel injection concentrate is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel injection concentrate cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel injection concentrate and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel injection concentrate should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel injection concentrate infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with docetaxel injection concentrate. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel injection concentrate infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel injection concentrate therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel injection concentrate administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel injection concentrate to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel injection concentrate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel injection concentrate due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel injection concentrate. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel injection concentrate treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel injection concentrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel injection concentrate. If docetaxel injection concentrate is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with docetaxel injection concentrate [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection concentrate may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in docetaxel injection concentrate on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of docetaxel injection concentrate at 100 mg/m2 delivers 4.75 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 9.5 grams of ethanol [see Description (11 ) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of TAXOTERE and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with TAXOTERE, close monitoring for toxicity and a TAXOTERE dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from TAXOTERE are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all TAXOTERE indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all TAXOTERE indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with TAXOTERE for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received TAXOTERE administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to TAXOTERE. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving TAXOTERE for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving TAXOTERE at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of TAXOTERE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention. Fluid retention can occur with the use of TAXOTERE [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after TAXOTERE infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3–5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on TAXOTERE, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given TAXOTERE at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given TAXOTERE at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5). Table 4 - Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 TAXOTERE 60 mg/m2 Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN Normal LFTs Adverse Reaction n=730 n=18 n=174 % % % Neutropenia Any <2000 cells/mm3 98 100 95 Grade 4 <500 cells/mm3 84 94 75 Thrombocytopenia Any <100,000 cells/mm3 11 44 14 Grade 4 <20,000 cells/mm3 1 17 1 Anemia <11 g/dL 95 94 65 InfectionIncidence of infection requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics was 8.5% (n=62) among the 730 patients with normal LFTs at baseline; 7 patients had concurrent grade 3 neutropenia, and 46 patients had grade 4 neutropenia.

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with TAXOTERE in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6). Table 6- Clinically Important Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Regardless of Causal Relationship in Patients Receiving TAXOTERE in Combination with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAX316).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with TAXOTERE for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with TAXOTERE when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with TAXOTERE. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received TAXOTERE, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of TAXOTERE Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient's ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.11) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving TAXOTERE (5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer TAXOTERE administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer TAXOTERE administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with TAXOTERE [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving TAXOTERE. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of TAXOTERE until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of TAXOTERE is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a TAXOTERE cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of TAXOTERE and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. TAXOTERE should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the TAXOTERE infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with TAXOTERE. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a TAXOTERE infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of TAXOTERE [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following TAXOTERE therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each TAXOTERE administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of TAXOTERE to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received TAXOTERE, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued TAXOTERE due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with TAXOTERE. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, TAXOTERE treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of TAXOTERE Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in TAXOTERE Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of TAXOTERE Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2.0 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 4.0 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy TAXOTERE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using TAXOTERE. If TAXOTERE is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with TAXOTERE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection Concentrate and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection Concentrate, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection Concentrate dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism (7)."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel injection concentrate are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection concentrate indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection concentrate indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6).

These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel injection concentrate. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel Injection Concentrate at 100 mg/m2 *Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN **Elevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN ***Febrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization All Tumor Types All Tumor Types Breast Cancer Normal LFTs* Elevated LFTs** Normal LFTs* Adverse Reaction n=2045 n=61 n=965 % % % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile Neutropenia*** 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel injection concentrate infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel injection concentrate, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel injection concentrate at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel injection concentrate at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5). Table 4 - Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at Docetaxel Injection Concentrate 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests *Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN **Elevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN ***Incidence of infection requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics was 8.5% (n=62) among the 730 patients with normal LFTs at baseline; 7 patients had concurrent grade 3 neutropenia, and 46 patients had grade 4 neutropenia. ****Febrile Neutropenia: For 100 mg/m2, ANC grade 4 and fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization; for 60 mg/m2, ANC grade 3/4 and fever >38.1°C Docetaxel Injection Concentrate Docetaxel Injection Concentrate 100 mg/m 2 60 mg/m 2 Normal LFTs* Elevated LFTs** Normal LFTs* Adverse Reaction n=730 n=18 n=174 % % % Neutropenia Any <2000 cells/mm3 98 100 95 Grade 4 <500 cells/mm3 84 94 75 Thrombocytopenia Any <100,000 cells/mm3 11 44 14 Grade 4 <20,000 cells/mm3 1 17 1 Anemia <11 g/dL 95 94 65 Infection*** Any 23 39 1 Grade 3 and 4 7 33 0 Febrile Neutropenia**** By Patient 12 33 0 By Course 2 9 0 Septic Death 2 6 1 Non-Septic Death 1 11 0 Table 5 - Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at Docetaxel Injection Concentrate 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests *Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN ** Elevated Baseline Liver Function: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN ***Fluid Retention includes (by COSTART): edema (peripheral, localized, generalized, lymphedema, pulmonary edema, and edema otherwise not specified) and effusion (pleural, pericardial, and ascites); no premedication given with the 60 mg/m2 dose NA = not available Docetaxel Injection Concentrate Docetaxel Injection Concentrate 100 mg/m 2 60 mg/m 2 Normal LFTs* Elevated LFTs** Normal LFTs* Adverse Reaction n=730 n=18 n=174 % % % Acute Hypersensitivity Reaction Regardless of Premedication Any 13 6 1 Severe 1 0 0 Fluid Retention*** Regardless of Premedication Any 56 61 13 Severe 8 17 0 Neurosensory Any 57 50 20 Severe 6 0 0 Myalgia 23 33 3 Cutaneous Any 45 61 31 Severe 5 17 0 Asthenia Any 65 44 66 Severe 17 22 0 Diarrhea Any 42 28 NA Severe 6 11 Stomatitis Any 53 67 19 Severe 8 39 1 In the three-arm monotherapy trial, TAX313, which compared docetaxel injection concentrate 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 in advanced breast cancer, grade 3/4 or severe adverse reactions occurred in 49.0% of patients treated with docetaxel injection concentrate 60 mg/m2 compared to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel injection concentrate in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel injection concentrate 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel injection concentrate when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial pneumonia. Pulmonary fibrosis has been rarely reported. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel injection concentrate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6). Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7). Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent (5.8). Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation (5.9). Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving docetaxel injection concentrate (5.10, 8.1). 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel injection concentrate administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel injection concentrate administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection Concentrate [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel injection concentrate. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel injection concentrate until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel injection concentrate is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel injection concentrate cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel injection concentrate and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel injection concentrate should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel injection concentrate infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with docetaxel injection concentrate. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel injection concentrate infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel injection concentrate [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel injection concentrate therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel injection concentrate administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel injection concentrate to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel injection concentrate, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel injection concentrate due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.10 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel injection concentrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel injection concentrate. If docetaxel injection concentrate is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with docetaxel injection concentrate [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. •Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism.

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: •Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] •Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] •Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] •Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] •Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc., at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 All Tumor Types All Tumor Types Breast Cancer Normal LFTs Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN.

The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)])demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) •Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) •Neurologic reactions: Reactions including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) •Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.9) •Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection (5.10, 8.1) •Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2.6 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 5.2 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection, USP and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, USP close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection, USP dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Neutropenia [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Fluid Retention [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100 or electronically at ProductComplaintsPP@hospira.com, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3).

Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [ see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

In the three-arm monotherapy trial, TAX313, which compared docetaxel 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 in advanced breast cancer, grade 3/4 or severe adverse reactions occurred in 49.0% of patients treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m2 compared to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Of the 744 patients treated with TAC, 36.3% experienced severe treatment emergent adverse reactions compared to 26.6% of the 736 patients treated with FAC. Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment occurred in 31 patients (7.6%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 37 patients (9.3%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole Diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous Very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic Bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity Rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic Rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic Confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic Conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Hearing Rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory Dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal Renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Cases of hyponatremia have been reported.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions includingparesthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation (5.10) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection, USP (5.11, 8.1) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14) ] . 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection, USP [ see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Studies (14) ]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection, USP. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection, USP until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection, USP is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection, USP cycle [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection, USP should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14) ]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection, USP infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection, USP. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection, USP infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection, USP [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection, USP administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g ., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial ( TAX316 ) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reaction Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms ( e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection, USP. If Docetaxel Injection, USP is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection, USP [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 1.8 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0m2, this would deliver 3.6 grams of ethanol [ see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with docetaxel injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a docetaxel injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)], Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel injection are: • Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions (5.1)] • Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with Docetaxel Injection for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapyDocetaxel injection 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel injection administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel injection. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel injection for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3).

The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38oC with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity ReactionsSevere hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention.Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel injection [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous ReactionsSevere skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel injection infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic ReactionsNeurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal ReactionsNausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3­ to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular ReactionsHypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel injection 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ³10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site ReactionsInfusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic ReactionsIn patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel injection, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalitiesHematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel injection at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel injection at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Of the 744 patients treated with TAC, 36.3% experienced severe treatment emergent adverse reactions compared to 26.6% of the 736 patients treated with FAC.Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and InfectionFever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively.Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal ReactionsIn addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular ReactionsMore cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel injection when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal syndrome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel injection, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.11) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving docetaxel injection (5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast CancerDocetaxel injection administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung CancerDocetaxel injection administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel injection and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. docetaxel injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with docetaxel injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel injection therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions.When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel injection to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel injection, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC- treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel injection due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5. 9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in docetaxel injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of docetaxel injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2 m2, this would deliver 4 grams of ethanol [see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel injection. If docetaxel injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with docetaxel injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Cutaneous Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Neurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Eye Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Asthenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-318-2170 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1. Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2,045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3: Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTs* n = 2,045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTs** n = 61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs* n = 965 % * Normal baseline LFTs: transaminases ≤ 1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN ** Elevated baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN *** Febrile neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever > 38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization Hematologic Neutropenia < 2,000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 < 500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia < 4,000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 < 1,000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia < 100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia < 11 g/dL 90 92 94 < 8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile neutropenia*** 11 26 12 Septic death 2 5 1 Non-septic death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in absence of infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity reactions Regardless of premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day premedication n = 92 n = 3 n = 92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid retention Regardless of premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day premedication n = 92 n = 3 n = 92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion site reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2,045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3 with fever > 38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 - 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT > 1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to Dose and Baseline Liver Chemistry Abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5). Table 4: Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction Normal LFTs* n = 730 % Elevated LFTs** n = 18 % Normal LFTs* n = 174 % * Normal baseline LFTs: transaminases ≤ 1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN ** Elevated baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN *** Incidence of infection requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics was 8.5% (n = 62) among the 730 patients with normal LFTs at baseline; 7 patients had concurrent grade 3 neutropenia, and 46 patients had grade 4 neutropenia. **** Febrile neutropenia: for 100 mg/m2, ANC grade 4 and fever > 38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization; for 60 mg/m2, ANC grade 3/4 and fever > 38.1°C Neutropenia Any < 2,000 cells/mm3 98 100 95 Grade 4 < 500 cells/mm3 84 94 75 Thrombocytopenia Any < 100,000 cells/mm3 11 44 14 Grade 4 < 20,000 cells/mm3 1 17 1 Anemia < 11 g/dL 95 94 65 Infection*** Any 23 39 1 Grade 3 and 4 7 33 0 Febrile neutropenia**** By patient 12 33 0 By course 2 9 0 Septic death 2 6 1 Non-septic death 1 11 0 Table 5: Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction Normal LFTs* n = 730 % Elevated LFTs** n = 18 % Normal LFTs* n = 174 % * Normal baseline LFTs: transaminases ≤ 1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN ** Elevated baseline liver function: AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN *** Fluid retention includes (by COSTART): edema (peripheral, localized, generalized, lymphedema, pulmonary edema, and edema otherwise not specified) and effusion (pleural, pericardial, and ascites); no premedication given with the 60 mg/m2 dose NA = Not available Acute hypersensitivity reaction Regardless of premedication Any 13 6 1 Severe 1 0 0 Fluid retention*** Regardless of premedication Any 56 61 13 Severe 8 17 0 Neurosensory Any 57 50 20 Severe 6 0 0 Myalgia 23 33 3 Cutaneous Any 45 61 31 Severe 5 17 0 Asthenia Any 65 44 66 Severe 17 22 0 Diarrhea Any 42 28 N/A Severe 6 11 Stomatitis Any 53 67 19 Severe 8 39 1 In the three-arm monotherapy trial, TAX313, which compared docetaxel 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 in advanced breast cancer, grade 3/4 or severe adverse reactions occurred in 49.0% of patients treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m2 compared to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11%, and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6). Table 6: Clinically Important Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Regardless of Causal Relationship in Patients Receiving Docetaxel in Combination with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAX316) Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 + Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC) n = 744 % Fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC) n = 736 % Adverse Reaction Any Grade 3/4 Any Grade 3/4 * COSTART term and grading system for events related to treatment.

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel + cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine + cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine + cisplatin versus docetaxel + carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia, and nail changes on the docetaxel + carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine + cisplatin arm.

Post-Marketing Experiences The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical trials and/or post-marketing surveillance. Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a Whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Cases of permanent alopecia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis, and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation (5.10) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection (5.11, 8.1) 5.1. Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN together with AP > 2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2. Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.3. Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level > 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (< 2,000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils < 1,500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin > 1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4. Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5. Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1,021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6. Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7. Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8. Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9. Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel Injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10. Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11. Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of DOCEFREZ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with DOCEFREZ, close monitoring for toxicity and a DOCEFREZ dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described for docetaxel according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 : Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 2). Table 2 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 <500 cells/mm3 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 <1000 cells/mm3 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 Anemia <11 g/dL <8 g/dL Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38oC with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 96 75 96 32 8 90 9 11 96 88 98 47 25 92 31 26 99 86 99 44 9 94 8 12 Septic Death Non-Septic Death 2 1 5 7 1 1 Infections Any Severe 22 6 33 16 22 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any Severe 31 2 41 8 35 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any Severe With 3-day Premedication Any Severe 21 4 n=92 15 2 20 10 n=3 33 0 18 3 n=92 15 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any Severe With 3-day Premedication Any Severe 47 7 n=92 64 7 39 8 n=3 67 33 60 9 n=92 64 7 Neurosensory Any Severe 49 4 34 0 58 6 Cutaneous Any Severe 48 5 54 10 47 5 Nail Changes Any Severe 31 3 23 5 41 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Severe 39 22 39 5 38 23 33 5 42 23 43 6 Stomatitis Any Severe 42 6 49 13 52 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any Severe 62 13 53 25 66 15 Myalgia Any Severe 19 2 16 2 21 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever > 38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of DOCEFREZ [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [ seeWarnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 patients (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT > 1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 3 and 4).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2 , 75 mg/m2 , and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11%, and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 5. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with DOCEFREZ, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Prostate Cancer Combination therapy with docetaxel in patients with prostate cancer The following data are based on the experience of 332 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (see Table 7).

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with DOCEFREZ. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient's ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.10) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.11) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving DOCEFREZ (5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer DOCEFREZ administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer DOCEFREZ administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with DOCEFREZ [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving DOCEFREZ. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of DOCEFREZ until neutrophils recover to a level > 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of DOCEFREZ is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a DOCEFREZ cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. DOCEFREZ should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1,500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the DOCEFREZ infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with DOCEFREZ. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a DOCEFREZ infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of DOCEFREZ [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each DOCEFREZ administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1,021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. The risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g.paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with DOCEFREZ. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, DOCEFREZ treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 1.425 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 2.85 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.11 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy DOCEFREZ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using DOCEFREZ. If DOCEFREZ is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with DOCEFREZ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. •Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism.

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: •Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] • Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 4). Table 4 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTs Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTs Elevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values > the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 5 and 6).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 7).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 8. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel + carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] ) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel + carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. Prostate Cancer Combination therapy with docetaxel in patients with prostate cancer The following data are based on the experience of 332 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (see Table 10).

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic:conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) •Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) •Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. ( 5.8 ) •Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) •Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. ( 5.10 ) •Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection (5.11, 8.1) •Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)] 5.4 Hypersensitivity reaction Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel Injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. For Two-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate and Diluent) Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 0.15 g/m2of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 0.3 grams of ethanol [see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. For One-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate) Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 1.975 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 3.95 grams of ethanol [see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from Docetaxel Injection are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all Docetaxel Injection indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all Docetaxel Injection indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Breast Cancer Monotherapy with Docetaxel Injection for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel Injection 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (see Table 3). Table 3 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n = 2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT > 1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 times ULN n = 61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n = 965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever > 38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n = 92 n = 3 n = 92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n = 92 n = 3 n = 92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3–5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5). Table 4 - Hematologic Adverse Reactions in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Chemotherapy Treated at docetaxel 100 mg/m2 with Normal or Elevated Liver Function Tests or 60 mg/m2 with Normal Liver Function Tests docetaxel 100 mg/m2 docetaxel 60 mg/m2 Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN Normal LFTs Adverse Reaction n=730 n=18 n=174 % % % Neutropenia Any <2000 cells/mm3 98 100 95 Grade 4 <500 cells/mm3 84 94 75 Thrombocytopenia Any <100,000 cells/mm3 11 44 14 Grade 4 <20,000 cells/mm3 1 17 1 Anemia <11 g/dL 95 94 65 InfectionIncidence of infection requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics was 8.5% (n=62) among the 730 patients with normal LFTs at baseline; 7 patients had concurrent grade 3 neutropenia, and 46 patients had grade 4 neutropenia.

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11%, and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with Docetaxel Injection in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6). Table 6 - Clinically Important Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Regardless of Causal Relationship in Patients Receiving docetaxel in Combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAX316). docetaxel 75 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC) n = 744 % fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC) n = 736 % Adverse Reaction Any Grade 3/4 Any Grade 3/4 Anemia 92 4 72 2 Neutropenia 71 66 82 49 Fever in absence of infection 47 1 17 0 Infection 39 4 36 2 Thrombocytopenia 39 2 28 1 Febrile neutropenia 25 N/A 3 N/A Neutropenic infection 12 N/A 6 N/A Hypersensitivity reactions 13 1 4 0 Lymphedema 4 0 1 0 Fluid Retention COSTART term and grading system for events related to treatment. 35 1 15 0 Peripheral edema 27 0 7 0 Weight gain 13 0 9 0 Neuropathy sensory 26 0 10 0 Neuro-cortical 5 1 6 1 Neuropathy motor 4 0 2 0 Neuro-cerebellar 2 0 2 0 Syncope 2 1 1 0 Alopecia 98 N/A 97 N/A Skin toxicity 27 1 18 0 Nail disorders 19 0 14 0 Nausea 81 5 88 10 Stomatitis 69 7 53 2 Vomiting 45 4 59 7 Diarrhea 35 4 28 2 Constipation 34 1 32 1 Taste perversion 28 1 15 0 Anorexia 22 2 18 1 Abdominal Pain 11 1 5 0 Amenorrhea 62 N/A 52 N/A Cough 14 0 10 0 Cardiac dysrhythmias 8 0 6 0 Vasodilatation 27 1 21 1 Hypotension 2 0 1 0 Phlebitis 1 0 1 0 Asthenia 81 11 71 6 Myalgia 27 1 10 0 Arthralgia 19 1 9 0 Lacrimation disorder 11 0 7 0 Conjunctivitis 5 0 7 0 Of the 744 patients treated with TAC, 36.3% experienced severe treatment emergent adverse reactions compared to 26.6% of the 736 patients treated with FAC. Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with Docetaxel Injection for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel Injection 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia. (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment. (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including.paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection. (5.11, 8.1) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient's ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g., paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel Injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of alcohol intoxication have been reported with docetaxel, including other formulations of docetaxel. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 3.2 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 6.4 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a lesser amount of alcohol."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with docetaxel, close monitoring for toxicity and a docetaxel dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention. Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3–5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6). Table 6- Clinically Important Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Regardless of Causal Relationship in Patients Receiving Docetaxel in Combination with Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAX316).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Deaths within 30 days of last study treatment attributed to study drug occurred in 9 patients (2.2%) in the docetaxel+cisplatin arm and 8 patients (2.0%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm. The second comparison in the study, vinorelbine+cisplatin versus docetaxel+carboplatin (which did not demonstrate a superior survival associated with docetaxel, [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]) demonstrated a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reactions, skin toxicity, alopecia and nail changes on the docetaxel+carboplatin arm, while a higher incidence of anemia, neurosensory toxicity, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and asthenia was observed on the vinorelbine+cisplatin arm.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient's ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.11) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving docetaxel (5.12, 8.1) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of docetaxel until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with docetaxel. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2.0 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 4.0 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. 5.12 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using docetaxel. If docetaxel is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with docetaxel [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. •Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism.

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: •Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] •Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] •Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] •Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] •Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc., at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3). Table 3 Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 All Tumor Types All Tumor Types Breast Cancer Normal LFTs Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN.

The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 7. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials. These reactions were described using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria regardless of relationship to study treatment, except for the hematologic toxicities or where otherwise noted.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic: conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) •Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) •Neurologic reactions: Reactions including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) •Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.9) •Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection (5.10, 8.1) •Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2.6 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 5.2 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, inhibitors, or substrates: May alter docetaxel metabolism. (7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel are: Toxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Fluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia. Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, myalgia(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Breast Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy Docetaxel 100 mg/m2: Adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks: 2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline. These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 4). Table 4 - Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTsNormal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTsElevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile NeutropeniaFebrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm3) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3 to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension occurred rarely. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values > the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 5 and 6).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 vs. 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, and 100 mg/m2 respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12% respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97% respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14% respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7% respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97% respectively). Combination therapy with docetaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer The following table presents treatment emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 7).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up). One patient in each arm died due to heart failure. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy. AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. This risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens. Lung Cancer Monotherapy with docetaxel for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy Docetaxel 75 mg/m2: Treatment emergent adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 8. Included in this table are safety data for a total of 176 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated in two randomized, controlled trials.

Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Cutaneous: very rare cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and rare cases of bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Scleroderma-like changes usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema. In some cases multiple factors may have contributed to the development of these effects. Severe hand and foot syndrome has been reported. Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis and dehydration as a consequence to gastrointestinal events have been reported. Hematologic: bleeding episodes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been reported. Cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasic syndrome have been reported in association with docetaxel when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents and/or radiotherapy. Hypersensitivity: rare cases of anaphylactic shock have been reported. Very rarely these cases resulted in a fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Hepatic: rare cases of hepatitis, sometimes fatal primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders, have been reported. Neurologic: confusion, rare cases of seizures or transient loss of consciousness have been observed, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug. Ophthalmologic:conjunctivitis, lacrimation or lacrimation with or without conjunctivitis. Excessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has been reported. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances (flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typically occurring during drug infusion and in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion. Cases of cystoid macular edema (CME) have been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Hearing: rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. Respiratory: dyspnea, acute pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, interstitial pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis have rarely been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome. Rare cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients receiving concomitant radiotherapy. Renal: renal insufficiency and renal failure have been reported, the majority of these cases were associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: cases of hyponatremia have been reported."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myeloid leukemia: In patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, monitor for delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia (5.6) Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment (5.7) Neurologic reactions: Reactions including. paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. (5.8) Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. (5.9) Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. (5.10) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised not to become pregnant when receiving Docetaxel Injection (5.11, 8.1) Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. (5.12) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2, mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)]. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with Docetaxel Injection [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)]. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm3. A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm3. Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2. Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)] 5.4 Hypersensitivity reaction Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with Docetaxel Injection. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] 5.5 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2. Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. 5.7 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. 5.8 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). 5.9 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel Injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.10 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.11 Use in Pregnancy Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Docetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. Embryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Docetaxel Injection. If Docetaxel Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.12 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. For Two-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate and Diluent) Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 0.15 g/m2of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 0.3 grams of ethanol [see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. For One-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate) Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 1.975 g/m2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 3.95 grams of ethanol [see Description (11) ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol."
