        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Methylxanthines interfere with the activity of adenosine (7.1,10) Nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole can increase the activity of adenosine (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Adenosine Injection The vasoactive effects of adenosine are inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonists, (such as methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline, and theophylline). The safety and efficacy of adenosine injection in the presence of these agents has not been systematically evaluated [see Overdosage (10)]. The vasoactive effects of adenosine are potentiated by nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole. The safety and efficacy of adenosine in the presence of dipyridamole has not been systematically evaluated. Whenever possible, drugs that might inhibit or augment the effects of adenosine should be withheld for at least five half-lives prior to the use of adenosine injection. 7.2 Effects of Adenosine on Other Drugs Adenosine injection has been given with other cardioactive drugs (such as beta adrenergic blocking agents, cardiac glycosides, and calcium channel blockers) without apparent adverse interactions, but its effectiveness with these agents has not been systematically evaluated. Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine injection should be used with caution in the presence of these agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

The following adverse reactions, with an incidence of at least 1%, were reported with adenosine injection among 1,421 patients in clinical trials. 11% of the adverse reactions occurred several hours after adenosine injection administration. 8% of the adverse reactions began with adenosine injection infusion and persisted for up to 24 hours. The most common (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) adverse reactions to adenosine injection are flushing, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, headache, throat, neck or jaw discomfort, gastrointestinal discomfort, and dizziness (Table 2).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available (5.1) Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. First-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block (5.2) Bronchoconstriction. Can induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops severe respiratory difficulties (5.3) Hypotension. Significant hypotension can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension (5.4) Cerebrovascular Accidents. Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.5) Seizures. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures have occurred. Use of methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) is not recommended in patients who experience a seizures in association with adenosine injection (5.6) Hypersensitivity. Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.7) Atrial Fibrillation. Reported in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation (5.8) Hypertension. Clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic pressure have been observed (5.9) 5.1 Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (requiring resuscitation), and myocardial infarction have occurred following adenosine injection infusion. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example, unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to adenosine injection. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine injection exerts a direct depressant effect on the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, approximately 6% of patients developed AV block following adenosine injection administration (first-degree heart block developed in 3%, second-degree in 3%, and third-degree in 0.8% of patients) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. Use adenosine injection with caution in patients with pre-existing first-degree AV block or bundle branch block. Do not use in patients with high-grade AV block or sinus node dysfunction (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block. 5.3 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine injection administration can cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Adenosine injection should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis). Do not use in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (e.g., asthma). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. Resuscitative measures should be available prior to adenosine injection administration [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.4 Hypotension Adenosine injection is a potent peripheral vasodilator and can induce significant hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Accident Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of adenosine injection including hypotension or hypertension can be associated with these adverse reactions. [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.9)]. 5.6 Seizures New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following adenosine injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with adenosine injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience seizures in association with adenosine injection administration [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Symptomatic treatment may be required. Have personnel and appropriate treatment available. Resuscitative measures may be necessary if symptoms progress. [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2) ]. 5.8 Atrial Fibrillation Adenosine injection can cause atrial fibrillation in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically began 1.5 to 3 minutes after initiation of adenosine injection, lasted for 15 seconds to 6 hours, and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2) ]. 5.9 Hypertension Adenosine injection can induce clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure . Most increases resolved spontaneously within several minutes, but in some cases, hypertension lasted for several hours [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Intravenous Adenocard (adenosine injection) has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with Adenocard (see Warnings ). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, Adenocard should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of Adenocard in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see Warnings ). The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available (5.1) • Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. First-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block (5.2) • Bronchoconstriction. Can induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops severe respiratory difficulties (5.3) • Hypotension. Significant hypotension can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension (5.4) • Cerebrovascular Accidents. Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.5) • Seizures. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures have occurred. Use of methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) is not recommended in patients who experience a seizures in association with adenosine injection (5.6) • Hypersensitivity. Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.7) • Atrial Fibrillation. Reported in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation (5.8) • Hypertension. Clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic pressure have been observed (5.9) 5.1 Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (requiring resuscitation), and myocardial infarction have occurred following adenosine infusion. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example, unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to adenosine injection. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine injection exerts a direct depressant effect on the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, approximately 6% of patients developed AV block following adenosine injection administration (first-degree heart block developed in 3%, second-degree in 3%, and third-degree in 0.8% of patients) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. Use adenosine injection with caution in patients with pre-existing first-degree AV block or bundle branch block. Do not use in patients with high-grade AV block or sinus node dysfunction (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block. 5.3 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine injection administration can cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Adenosine injection should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis). Do not use in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (e.g., asthma). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. Resuscitative measures should be available prior to adenosine injection administration [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.4 Hypotension Adenosine injection is a potent peripheral vasodilator and can induce significant hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Accident Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of adenosine injection including hypotension or hypertension can be associated with these adverse reactions. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.9)]. 5.6 Seizures New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following adenosine injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with adenosine injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience seizures in association with adenosine injection administration [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity, including Anaphylaxis Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Symptomatic treatment may be required. Have personnel and appropriate treatment available. Resuscitative measures may be necessary if symptoms progress. [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.8 Atrial Fibrillation Adenosine injection can cause atrial fibrillation in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically began 1.5 to 3 minutes after initiation of adenosine injection, lasted for 15 seconds to 6 hours, and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.9 Hypertension Adenosine injection can induce clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Most increases resolved spontaneously within several minutes, but in some cases, hypertension lasted for several hours [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]."

Table 2 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials (Frequency ≥ 1%) Adverse Reactions Adenosine N=1,421 Flushing 44% Chest discomfort 40% Dyspnea 28% Headache 18% Throat, neck or jaw discomfort 15% Gastrointestinal discomfort 13% Lightheadedness/dizziness 12% Upper extremity discomfort 4% ST segment depression 3% First-degree AV block 3% Second-degree AV block 3% Paresthesia 2% Hypotension 2% Nervousness 2% Arrhythmias 1% Adverse reactions to adenosine of any severity reported in less than 1% of patients include: Body as a Whole: back discomfort, lower extremity discomfort, weakness Cardiovascular System: myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, third-degree AV block, bradycardia, palpitation, sinus exit block, sinus pause, T-wave changes, hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg) Respiratory System: cough Central Nervous System: drowsiness, emotional instability, tremors Genital/Urinary System: Vaginal pressure, urgency Special Senses: blurred vision, dry mouth, ear discomfort, metallic taste, nasal congestion, scotomas, tongue discomfort 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported from marketing experience with adenosine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, are associated with concomitant diseases and multiple drug therapies and surgical procedures, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia Gastrointestinal Disorders: nausea and vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: chest pain, injection site reaction, infusion site pain Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Nervous System Disorders: cerebrovascular accident including intracranial hemorrhage, seizure activity including tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, loss of consciousness Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: bronchospasm, respiratory arrest, throat tightness"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available (5.1) Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. First-, second-or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia can occur. Discontinue adenosine if patient develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block (5.2) Bronchoconstriction. Can induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. Discontinue adenosine if patient develops severe respiratory difficulties (5.3) Hypotension. Significant hypotension can occur. Discontinue adenosine if patient develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension (5.4) Cerebrovascular Accidents. Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.5) Seizures. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures have occurred. Use of methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) is not recommended in patients who experience a seizures in association with adenosine (5.6) Hypersensitivity. Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.7) Atrial Fibrillation. Reported in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation (5.8) Hypertension. Clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic pressure have been observed (5.9) 5.1 Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (requiring resuscitation), and myocardial infarction have occurred following adenosine infusion. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example, unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to adenosine. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine exerts a direct depressant effect on the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, approximately 6% of patients developed AV block following adenosine administration (first-degree heart block developed in 3%, second-degree in 3%, and third-degree in 0.8% of patients) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. Use adenosine with caution in patients with pre-existing first-degree AV block or bundle branch block. Do not use in patients with high-grade AV block or sinus node dysfunction (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block. 5.3 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine administration can cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Adenosine should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis). Do not use in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (e.g., asthma). Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. Resuscitative measures should be available prior to adenosine administration [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.4 Hypotension Adenosine is a potent peripheral vasodilator and can induce significant hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Accident Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of adenosine including hypotension or hypertension can be associated with these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.9)]. 5.6 Seizures New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following adenosine. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with adenosine. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience seizures in association with adenosine administration [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Symptomatic treatment may be required. Have personnel and appropriate treatment available. Resuscitative measures may be necessary if symptoms progress [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.8 Atrial Fibrillation Adenosine can cause atrial fibrillation in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically began 1.5 to 3 minutes after initiation of adenosine, lasted for 15 seconds to 6 hours, and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.9 Hypertension Adenosine can induce clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Most increases resolved spontaneously within several minutes, but in some cases, hypertension lasted for several hours [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]."

        "Drug Interactions Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see WARNINGS ). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see WARNINGS ). The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine."

        "Drug Interactions Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see WARNINGS ). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see WARNINGS ). The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available (5.1) Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. First-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block (5.2) Bronchoconstriction. Can induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops severe respiratory difficulties (5.3) Hypotension. Significant hypotension can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension (5.4) Cerebrovascular Accidents. Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.5) Seizures. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures have occurred. Use of methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) is not recommended in patients who experience a seizures in association with adenosine injection (5.6) Hypersensitivity. Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.7) Atrial Fibrillation. Reported in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation (5.8) Hypertension. Clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic pressure have been observed (5.9) 5.1 Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (requiring resuscitation), and myocardial infarction have occurred following adenosine injection infusion. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example, unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to adenosine injection. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine injection exerts a direct depressant effect on the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, approximately 6% of patients developed AV block following adenosine injection administration (first-degree heart block developed in 3%, second-degree in 3%, and third-degree in 0.8% of patients) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. Use adenosine injection with caution in patients with pre-existing first-degree AV block or bundle branch block. Do not use in patients with high-grade AV block or sinus node dysfunction (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block. 5.3 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine injection administration can cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Adenosine injection should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis). Do not use in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (e.g., asthma). Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. Resuscitative measures should be available prior to adenosine injection administration [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.4 Hypotension Adenosine injection is a potent peripheral vasodilator and can induce significant hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Discontinue adenosine injection in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Accident Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of adenosine injection including hypotension or hypertension can be associated with these adverse reactions. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.9)]. 5.6 Seizures New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following adenosine injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with adenosine injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience seizures in association with adenosine injection administration [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Symptomatic treatment may be required. Have personnel and appropriate treatment available. Resuscitative measures may be necessary if symptoms progress. [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.8 Atrial Fibrillation Adenosine injection can cause atrial fibrillation in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically began 1.5 to 3 minutes after initiation of adenosine injection, lasted for 15 seconds to 6 hours, and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.9 Hypertension Adenosine injection can induce clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure . Most increases resolved spontaneously within several minutes, but in some cases, hypertension lasted for several hours [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]."

        "Drug Interactions Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see WARNINGS). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see WARNINGS). The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of adenosine. Adenosine was negative for genotoxic potential in the Salmonella (Ames Test) and mammalian Microsome Assay. Adenosine, however, like other nucleosides at millimolar concentrations present for several doubling times of cells in culture, is known to produce a variety of chromosomal alterations. Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with adenosine. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with adenosine; nor have studies been performed in pregnant women. As adenosine is a naturally occurring material, widely dispersed throughout the body, no fetal effects would be anticipated. However, since it is not known whether adenosine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women, adenosine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use No controlled studies have been conducted in pediatric patients to establish the safety and efficacy of adenosine injection for the conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). However, intravenous adenosine has been used for the treatment of PSVT in neonates, infants, children and adolescents (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).1 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of injected adenosine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, adenosine in geriatric patients should be used with caution since the population may have a diminished cardiac function, nodal dysfunction, concomitant diseases or drug therapy that may alter hemodynamic function and produce severe bradycardia or AV block."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Methylxanthines interfere with the activity of adenosine (7.1, 10) Nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole can increase the activity of adenosine (7.1) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Adenosine The vasoactive effects of adenosine are inhibited by adenosine receptor antagonists, (such as methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline, and theophylline). The safety and efficacy of adenosine in the presence of these agents has not been systematically evaluated [see Overdosage (10)]. The vasoactive effects of adenosine are potentiated by nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole. The safety and efficacy of adenosine in the presence of dipyridamole has not been systematically evaluated. Whenever possible, drugs that might inhibit or augment the effects of adenosine should be withheld for at least five half-lives prior to the use of adenosine. 7.2 Effects of Adenosine on Other Drugs Adenosine injection has been given with other cardioactive drugs (such as beta adrenergic blocking agents, cardiac glycosides, and calcium channel blockers) without apparent adverse interactions, but its effectiveness with these agents has not been systematically evaluated. Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available (5.1) Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block First-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia can occur. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block (5.2) Bronchoconstriction Can induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. Discontinue adenosine injection if patient develops severe respiratory difficulties (5.3) Hypotension Significant hypotension can occur. Discontinue adenosine if patient develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension (5.4) Cerebrovascular Accidents Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (5.5) Seizures New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures have occurred. Use of methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine, aminophylline and theophylline) is not recommended in patients who experience a seizures in association with adenosine (5.6) Hypersensitivity Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (5.7) Atrial Fibrillation Reported in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation (5.8) Hypertension Clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic pressure have been observed (5.9) 5.1 Cardiac Arrest, Ventricular Arrhythmias, and Myocardial Infarction Fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (requiring resuscitation), and myocardial infarction have occurred following adenosine infusion. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example, unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to adenosine. Appropriate resuscitative measures should be available [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine exerts a direct depressant effect on the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia. In clinical trials, approximately 6% of patients developed AV block following adenosine administration (first-degree heart block developed in 3%, second-degree in 3%, and third-degree in 0.8% of patients) [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. Use adenosine with caution in patients with pre-existing first-degree AV block or bundle branch block. Do not use in patients with high-grade AV block or sinus node dysfunction (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker). Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic high-grade AV block. 5.3 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine administration can cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Adenosine should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis). Do not use in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (e.g., asthma). Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. Resuscitative measures should be available prior to adenosine administration [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.4 Hypotension Adenosine is a potent peripheral vasodilator and can induce significant hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. Discontinue adenosine in any patient who develops persistent or symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Accident Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of adenosine including hypotension or hypertension can be associated with these adverse reactions. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and (5.9)]. 5.6 Seizures New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following adenosine. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with adenosine. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience seizures in association with adenosine administration [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Dyspnea, throat tightness, flushing, erythema, rash, and chest discomfort have occurred. Symptomatic treatment may be required. Have personnel and appropriate treatment available. Resuscitative measures may be necessary if symptoms progress. [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.8 Atrial Fibrillation Adenosine can cause atrial fibrillation in patients with or without a history of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation typically began 1.5 to 3 minutes after initiation of adenosine, lasted for 15 seconds to 6 hours, and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.9 Hypertension Adenosine can induce clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Most increases resolved spontaneously within several minutes, but in some cases, hypertension lasted for several hours [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]."
