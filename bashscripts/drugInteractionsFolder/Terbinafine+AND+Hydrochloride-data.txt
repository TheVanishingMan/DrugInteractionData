Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine hydrochloride tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers."

The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine.

An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine HCl tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine tablets use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia, angioedema, and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5, and 5.6) ]. Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine HCl [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine hydrochloride tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine hydrochloride tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine hydrochloride tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤ 1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without pre-existing liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine HCl use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine HCl tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine HCl tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine HCl-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine HCl, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine HCl should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During post-marketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine hydrochloride tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine hydrochloride tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine hydrochloride tablets were administered with food.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occured with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets in individuals with and without pre-existing liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine hydrochloride use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine hydrochloride tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine hydrochloride-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine hydrochloride. Terbinafine hydrochloride therapy should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine hydrochloride tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine HCl should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine HCl tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine HCl tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine HCl tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine HCl tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine HCl tablets can be taken with or without food."

The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Terbinafine hydrochloride should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient's liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of TasteTaste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of SmellSmell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive SymptomsDepressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic EffectsTransient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine hydrochloride-treated subjects (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated subjects (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity ReactionsThere have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens - Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus ErythematosusDuring postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory MonitoringMeasurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine hydrochloride tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers."

Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine hydrochloride tablets. Terbinafine hydrochloride tablets may cause taste disturbance (including taste loss) which usually recovers within several weeks after discontinuation of the drug. There have been reports of prolonged (greater than one year) taste disturbance. Taste disturbances associated with oral terbinafine have been reported to be severe enough to result in decreased food intake leading to significant and unwanted weight loss. Other adverse reactions which have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss. Clinical adverse effects reported spontaneously since the drug was marketed include altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin and terbinafine hydrochloride tablets and agranulocytosis (rare)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine. Drug interactions have also been noted with cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC). In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Coadministration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

(5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is < 1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without pre-existing liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is <1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During post-marketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine. Drug interactions have also been noted with cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2 fold increase in Cmax and a 5 fold increase in area under the curve (AUC). In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/ dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16 to 97 fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin.In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Coadministration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of Lamisil Tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 subjects receiving Lamisil Tablets (1.7%) and 3/137 subjects receiving placebo (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of Lamisil Tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking Lamisil Tablets. Lamisil Tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking Lamisil Tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan /dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizers status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common (> 2% in patients treated with terbinafine tablets) reported adverse events include headache, diarrhea, rash, dyspepsia, liver enzyme abnormalities, pruritus, taste disturbance, nausea, abdominal pain, and flatulence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc at 1-866-495-8330 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported adverse events observed in the three US/Canadian placebo-controlled trials are listed in the table below. The adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported following the use of terbinafine tablets in controlled trials. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation from study participation. 3a183255-figure-01 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of terbinafine. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine tablets use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia, angioedema, and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5 , and 5.6)]. Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Other adverse reactions which have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, reduced visual acuity, visual field defect, hair loss, serum sickness-like reaction, vasculitis, pancreatitis, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, photosensitivity reactions, tinnitus, hearing impairment and vertigo. Altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin has been reported."

(5.5) • Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without pre-existing liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets.

Coadministration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Terbinafine HCl should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine HCl-treated subjects (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated subjects (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis and bullous dermatitis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine HCl should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine HCl tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan, terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine.

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) ] Immune system disorders: Serious hypersensitivity reactions e.g., angioedema and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7) ], serum sickness-like reaction Psychiatric disorders: Depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) ] Nervous system disorders: Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 and 5.3) ] Eye disorders: Visual field defects, reduced visual acuity Ear and labyrinth disorders: Hearing impairment, vertigo, tinnitus Vascular disorders: Vasculitis Gastrointestinal disorders: Pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of liver failure some leading to liver transplant or death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ], idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Serious skin reactions [e.g., Stevens - Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome] [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)], acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, photosensitivity reactions, hair loss Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, arthralgia, myalgia General disorders and administration site conditions: Malaise, fatigue, influenza-like illness, pyrexia Investigations: Altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin and increased blood creatine phosphokinase have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. ( 5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. ( 5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. ( 5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. ( 5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤ 1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. ( 5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. ( 5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Terbinafine tablets should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is <1,000 cells/mm 3, terbinafine should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above reactions occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During post-marketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) Oral Granules The data described below reflect exposure to terbinafine including 1042 subjects exposed for a median of 42 days. Lamisil Oral Granules was studied in 2 active-controlled trials (n=1042). The population was children aged 4 to 12 years old, 64% male and 36% female, 21% Caucasian, 47% Black, 32% Other. Baseline disease (dermatophyte) characteristics of subjects included 49% having T. tonsurans, 15% T. violaceum, 15% M. canis, 2% M. audouinii, and 1% others. Subjects received once daily, for 6 weeks, oral doses of Lamisil Oral Granules based on body weight: <25 kg 125 mg/day, 25-35 kg 187.5 mg/day, and >35 kg 250 mg/day. Adverse events reported in the 2 trials are listed in the table below.

The most common categories of adverse events causing discontinuation in those exposed to terbinafine included gastrointestinal disorders, skin and subcutaneous disorders, and infections and infestations. No ophthalmologic safety signal was identified in the pooled pivotal trials. Ophthalmologic assessments included dilated fundoscopy to assess for refractile bodies in the retina, visual acuity assessment, and color vision testing. Of the 940 subjects in the terbinafine group and 471 subjects in the griseofulvin group who completed dilated fundoscopy at posttreatment visits, none of the subjects were found to have refractile bodies of the retina at baseline or end of treatment. For visual acuity, 1% (11/837) of subjects treated with terbinafine and 2% (7/426) of subjects treated with griseofulvin showed a doubling of visual angle after 6 weeks of treatment, while 2% (15/837) treated with terbinafine and 3% (12/426) treated with griseofulvin showed a halving of the visual angle after 6 weeks of treatment. Of subjects who completed yellow-blue color vision assessment for acquired defects, 5% (13/262) of subjects treated with terbinafine and 6% (8/129) of subjects treated with griseofulvin had color confusion on more than 1 symbol at week 6 than at baseline, while 13% (33/262) of subjects treated with terbinafine and 13% (17/129) of subjects treated with griseofulvin identified more symbols correctly at week 6 than at baseline. Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) Tablets Adverse events reported in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled trials included diarrhea (6%), rashes (6%), dyspepsia (4%), nausea (3%), liver abnormalities (3%), pruritus (3%), taste disturbances (3%), abdominal pain (2%), and urticaria (1%). Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported following the use of Lamisil Tablets in clinical trials in adult subjects with onychomycosis. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of oral terbinafine.

Discontinue Lamisil Oral Granules if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with oral terbinafine use. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue Lamisil Oral Granules if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of oral terbinafine. Smell disturbance may be prolonged or may be permanent. Discontinue Lamisil Oral Granules if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with oral terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is <1000 cells/mm3, Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, discontinue Lamisil Oral Granules. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of oral terbinafine during postmarketing experience in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with oral terbinafine use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Lamisil Oral Granules are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing Lamisil Oral Granules, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Lamisil Oral Granules should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed Lamisil Oral Granules and/or their guardians should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking Lamisil Oral Granules, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of oral terbinafine. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of oral terbinafine. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of oral terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 subjects receiving Lamisil Tablets (1.7%) and 3/137 subjects receiving placebo (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of oral terbinafine, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome] with oral terbinafine. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with Lamisil Oral Granules should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking oral terbinafine. Therapy should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking Lamisil Oral Granules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan /dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizers status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common (> 2% in patients treated with terbinafine tablets) reported adverse events include headache, diarrhea, rash, dyspepsia, liver enzyme abnormalities, pruritus, taste disturbance, nausea, abdominal pain, and flatulence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc at 1-866-495-8330 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported adverse events observed in the three US/Canadian placebo-controlled trials are listed in the table below. The adverse events reported encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain), liver test abnormalities, rashes, urticaria, pruritus, and taste disturbances. Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported following the use of terbinafine tablets in controlled trials. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. In general, the adverse events were mild, transient, and did not lead to discontinuation from study participation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of terbinafine. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine tablets use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia, angioedema, and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.5 , and 5.6 )]. Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Other adverse reactions which have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, reduced visual acuity, visual field defect, hair loss, serum sickness-like reaction, vasculitis, pancreatitis, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, photosensitivity reactions, tinnitus, hearing impairment and vertigo. Altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin has been reported."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine. Drug interactions have also been noted with cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC). In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/ dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16-to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Coadministration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If signs or symptoms of drug reaction occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without preexisting liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with use of terbinafine tablets, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, liver function tests should be performed since hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Periodic monitoring of liver function tests is recommended. Terbinafine hydrochloride should be immediately discontinued in case of elevation of liver function tests. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine, or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient's liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than 1 year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine tablets. Prescribers should be alert to the development of depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine hydrochloride-treated subjects (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated subjects (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on 2 or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than 6 weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine tablets, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is ≤1000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., Stevens - Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous dermatitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]. Manifestations of DRESS syndrome may include cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more organ complications such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. If progressive skin rash or signs/symptoms of the above drug reactions occur, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During postmarketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of terbinafine hydrochloride should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant. Co-administration of a single dose of fluconazole (100mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine Cmax and AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. 7.2 Food Interactions An evaluation of the effect of food on terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC (i.e. area under the curve) of terbinafine was observed when terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food."

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse events, based on worldwide experience with terbinafine tablets use, include: idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury and more rarely, cases of liver failure, some leading to death or liver transplant, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia, angioedema, and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5 , and 5.6)]. Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Cases of taste disturbance, including taste loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Depressive symptoms independent of taste disturbance have been reported with use of terbinafine tablets. In some cases, depressive symptoms have been reported to subside with discontinuance of therapy and to recur with reinstitution of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cases of smell disturbance, including smell loss, have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Other adverse reactions which have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, reduced visual acuity, visual field defect, hair loss, serum sickness-like reaction, vasculitis, pancreatitis, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, photosensitivity reactions, tinnitus, hearing impairment and vertigo. Altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin has been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver failure, sometimes leading to liver transplant or death, has occurred with the use of oral terbinafine. Obtain pretreatment serum transaminases. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if liver injury develops. (5.1, 5.8) Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Taste disturbance can be severe, may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if taste disturbance occurs. (5.2) Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may be prolonged, or may be permanent. Discontinue terbinafine tablets if smell disturbance occurs. (5.3) Depressive symptoms have been reported with terbinafine use. Prescribers should be alert to development of depressive symptoms. (5.4) Severe neutropenia has been reported. If the neutrophil count is ≤ 1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.5) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with oral terbinafine use. If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. (5.6) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Cases of liver failure, some leading to liver transplant or death, have occurred with the use of terbinafine tablets in individuals with and without pre-existing liver disease. In the majority of liver cases reported in association with terbinafine hydrochloride use, the patients had serious underlying systemic conditions. The severity of hepatic events and/or their outcome may be worse in patients with active or chronic liver disease. Treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued if biochemical or clinical evidence of liver injury develops. Terbinafine tablets are not recommended for patients with chronic or active liver disease. Before prescribing terbinafine tablets, pre-existing liver disease should be assessed. Hepatotoxicity may occur in patients with and without pre-existing liver disease. Patients prescribed terbinafine tablets should be warned to report immediately to their physician any symptoms of persistent nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain or jaundice, dark urine or pale stools. Patients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral terbinafine, and the patient’s liver function should be immediately evaluated. 5.2 Taste Disturbance Including Loss of Taste Taste disturbance, including taste loss, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. It can be severe enough to result in decreased food intake, weight loss, and depressive symptoms. Taste disturbance may resolve within several weeks after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a taste disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.3 Smell Disturbance Including Loss of Smell Smell disturbance, including loss of smell, has been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Smell disturbance may resolve after discontinuation of treatment, but may be prolonged (greater than one year), or may be permanent. If symptoms of a smell disturbance occur, terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.4 Depressive Symptoms Depressive symptoms have occurred during postmarketing use of terbinafine. Prescribers should be alert to depressive symptoms, and patients should be instructed to report depressive symptoms to their physician. 5.5 Hematologic Effects Transient decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) have been observed in controlled clinical trials. In placebo-controlled trials, 8/465 terbinafine hydrochloride-treated patients (1.7%) and 3/137 placebo-treated patients (2.2%) had decreases in ALC to below 1000/mm3 on two or more occasions. In patients with known or suspected immunodeficiency, physicians should consider monitoring complete blood counts if treatment continues for more than six weeks. Cases of severe neutropenia have been reported. These were reversible upon discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride, with or without supportive therapy. If clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of secondary infection occur, a complete blood count should be obtained. If the neutrophil count is <1,000 cells/mm3, terbinafine hydrochloride should be discontinued and supportive management started. 5.6 Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). If progressive skin rash occurs, treatment with terbinafine tablets should be discontinued. 5.7 Lupus Erythematosus During post-marketing experience, precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking terbinafine tablets. Terbinafine tablets should be discontinued in patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Laboratory Monitoring Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets."

        "Drug Interactions In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes; tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g. flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of terbinafine hydrochloride. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, and cyclosporine. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers."

Psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and precipitation and exacerbation of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported in patients taking Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets. Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets may cause taste disturbance (including taste loss) which usually recovers within several weeks after discontinuation of the drug. There have been reports of prolonged (greater than one year) taste disturbance. Taste disturbances associated with oral terbinafine have been reported to be severe enough to result in decreased food intake leading to significant and unwanted weight loss. Other adverse reactions which have been reported include malaise, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, and hair loss. Clinical adverse effects reported spontaneously since the drug was marketed include altered prothrombin time (prolongation and reduction) in patients concomitantly treated with warfarin and Terbinafine Hydrochloride Tablets and agranulocytosis (rare)."
