        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Olaparib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A. •CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If the inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose. (2.3, 7.2) •CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. If a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, be aware of a potential for decreased efficacy. (7.3) 7.1 Anticancer Agents Clinical studies of Lynparza in combination with other myelosuppressive anticancer agents, including DNA damaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. 7.2 Drugs that may Increase Olaparib Plasma Concentrations In patients (N=57), co-administration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased AUC of olaparib by 2.7-fold. A moderate CYP3A inhibitor, fluconazole, is predicted to increase the AUC of olaparib by 2-fold. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, voriconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, ritinovir, lopinavir/ritinovir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil). If the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be co-administered, reduce the dose of Lynparza [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during Lynparza treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Drugs that may Decrease Olaparib Plasma Concentrations In patients (N=22), co-administration of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased AUC of olaparib by 87%. A moderate CYP3A inducer, efavirenz, is predicted to decrease the AUC of olaparib by 50-60%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. John’s Wort) and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin). If a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, be aware of a potential for decreased efficacy of Lynparza [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] •Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] •Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in clinical trials were anemia, nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), vomiting, diarrhea, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, headache, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis/URI, cough, arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, back pain, dermatitis/rash and abdominal pain/discomfort. (6.1) • Most common laboratory abnormalities (≥25%) were increase in creatinine, mean corpuscular volume elevation, decrease in hemoglobin, decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in absolute neutrophil count, and decrease in platelets. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Lynparza 400 mg twice daily as monotherapy, has been studied in 300 patients with gBRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, and 223 of these patients had received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. In the 223 patients with gBRCA-mutated ovarian cancer who received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy (including 137 patients in Study 1 with measureable disease) [see Clinical Studies (14) ], adverse reactions led to dose interruption in 40% of patients, dose reduction in 4%, and discontinuation in 7%. There were 8 (4%) patients with adverse reactions leading to death, two were attributed to acute leukemia, and one each was attributed to COPD, cerebrovascular accident, intestinal perforation, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, and suture rupture. Table 1 presents the frequency of adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of 223 patients (in 6 studies) with gBRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who had received 3 or more prior lines of chemotherapy who were treated with Lynparza 400 mg twice daily. The median exposure to Lynparza in these patients was 158 days.

The following adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities have been identified in ≥1 to <10% of the 223 patients receiving Lynparza and not included in the table: leukopenia, stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, pyrexia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, dysuria, urinary incontinence, vulvovaginal disorder, dry skin/ eczema, pruritis, hypertension, venous thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism), and hot flush. Table 3 presents adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients from a randomized trial of Lynparza 400 mg twice daily as maintenance monotherapy compared to placebo in patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer following treatment with 2 or more platinum-containing regimens. Table 4 presents the laboratory abnormalities in patients from this randomized trial. Of the 96 patients with gBRCA-mutation, 53 received Lynparza, and 43 received placebo. The median duration on treatment with Lynparza was 11.1 months for patients with a gBRCA mutation compared to 4.4 months for patients with gBRCA mutation on placebo. Adverse reactions led to dose interruptions in 26% of those receiving Lynparza and 7% of those receiving placebo; dose reductions in 15% of Lynparza and 5% of placebo patients; and discontinuation in 9% of Lynparza and 0% in placebo patients. One (2%) patient on Lynparza died as a result of an adverse reaction.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia: (MDS/AML) occurred in patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (5.1) •Pneumonitis: occurred in patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected. Discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. (5.2) •Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Lynparza can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.3, 8.1) 5.1 Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been confirmed in 6 out of 298 (2%) patients enrolled in a single arm trial of Lynparza monotherapy, in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) advanced cancers. In a randomized placebo controlled trial, MDS/AML occurred in 3 out of 136 (2%) patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with Lynparza. Overall, MDS/AML were reported in 22 of 2,618 (<1%) patients treated with Lynparza. The majority of MDS/AML cases (17 of 22 cases) were fatal, and the duration of therapy with Lynparza in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer-therapy related AML varied from <6 months to >2 years. All patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents. Monitor complete blood count testing at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start Lynparza until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤CTCAE Grade 1). For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt Lynparza and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza. 5.2 Pneumonitis Pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in <1% of patients treated with Lynparza. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, cough, wheezing, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt treatment with Lynparza and initiate prompt investigation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Olaparib was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal toxicity in rats at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Lynparza. If contraceptive methods are being considered, use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."
