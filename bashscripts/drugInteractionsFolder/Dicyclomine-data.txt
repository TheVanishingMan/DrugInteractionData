Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS .) Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide.

They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. see Clinical Pharmacology (12) The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,5.3) The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect the exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS : worsening of conditions Cardiovascular conditions (5.2) : heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted Peripheral and central nervous system (5.3) : signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (5.3) : overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase Myasthenia Gravis (5.4) : diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal Incomplete intestinal obstruction (5.5) : due to risk of toxic megacolon Salmonella dysenteric patients (5.6) : dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon Ulcerative colitis (5.7) : dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention Prostatic hypertrophy (5.8) : should be used with caution Hepatic and renal disease (5.9) : use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride's adverse events Geriatric (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension . [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation . [see Adverse Reactions (6)] In the presence of a high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful . [see Contraindications (4)] Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis . [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] [see Contraindications (4)] 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatic Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have has been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Antiglaucoma agents: anticholinergics antagonize antiglaucoma agents and may increase intraoccular pressure (7) Anticholinergic agents: may affect the gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs; may also increase certain actions or side effects of other anticholinergic drugs (7) Antacids: interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents (7) Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine hydrochloride in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine hydrochloride: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine hydrochloride, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result. The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicyclomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,5.3) ]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect the exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo.

In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs: signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride's adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the presence of a high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)] . Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatic Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Dicyclomine is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.3 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.4 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.5 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs: signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicyclomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-800-325-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo.

In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis) Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine hydrochloride in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine hydrochloride: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine hydrochloride, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result. The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicyclomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients.

The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs: signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride's adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the presence of a high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)] . Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatic Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Use of dicyclomine hydrochloride in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine hydrochloride: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine hydrochloride, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result.

The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect the exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo.

In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs: signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride's adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the presence of a high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)] . Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatic Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antiglaucoma agents: anticholinergics antagonize antiglaucoma agents and may increase intraoccular pressure ( 7) Anticholinergic agents: may affect the gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs; may also increase certain actions or side effects of other anticholinergic drugs ( 7) Antacids: interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents ( 7) 7.1 Antiglaucoma Agents Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine hydrochloride in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 7.2 Other Drugs with Anticholinergic Activity The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine hydrochloride: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. 7.3 Other Gastrointestinal Motility Drugs Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. 7.4 Effect of Antacids Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine hydrochloride, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. 7.5 Effect on Absorption of Other Drugs Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result. 7.6 Effect on Gastric Acid Secretion The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12)] . They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness ( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions ( MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions ( 5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted ( 5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride ( 5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase ( 5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal ( 5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon ( 5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon ( 5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention ( 5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution ( 5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events ( 5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)] . In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have has been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications ( 4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3)] . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3)] . 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg 4 times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision Blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • Cardiac Disorders : palpitations, tachyarrhythmias • Eye Disorders : cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred • Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : fatigue, malaise • Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock • Nervous System Disorders : dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope • Psychiatric Disorders : As with the other anticholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported.• Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: suppressed lactation • Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : dyspnoea, nasal congestion • Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder : dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiovascular conditions : worsening of conditions ( 5.2 ) • Peripheral and central nervous system : heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted ( 5.3 ) • Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) : signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine ( 5.3 ) • Myasthenia Gravis : overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase ( 5.4 ) • Incomplete intestinal obstruction : diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine would be inappropriate and possibly fatal ( 5.5 ) • Salmonella dysenteric patients : due to risk of toxic megacolon ( 5.6 ) • Ulcerative colitis : Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon ( 5.7 ) • Prostatic hypertrophy : Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention ( 5.8 ) • Hepatic and renal disease : should be used with caution ( 5.9 ) • Geriatric : use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine’s adverse events ( 5.10 ) Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision.

Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS.) Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have has been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • Cardiac Disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias • Eye Disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred • Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: fatigue, malaise • Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock • Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope • Psychiatric Disorders: As with the other anticholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. • Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: suppressed lactation • Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion • Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis) Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching and other dermal manifestations Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) • Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) • Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine (5.3) • Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) • Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) • Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) • Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) • Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) • Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) • Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS.) Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.

They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12)] . They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness ( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions ( MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions ( 5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted ( 5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride ( 5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase ( 5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal ( 5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon ( 5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon ( 5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention ( 5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution ( 5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events ( 5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6)] . In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have has been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension . [see Adverse Reactions ( )] 6.3 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation . [see Adverse Reactions ( )] 6 In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications ( )]. 4 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful . [see Contraindications ( )] 4 Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis . [see Adverse Reactions ( )]. 6.3 [see Contraindications ( )] 4 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention .

They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. BENTYL may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking BENTYL. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)] . Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . BENTYL is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy BENTYL should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease BENTYL should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg 4 times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision Blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • Cardiac Disorders : palpitations, tachyarrhythmias • Eye Disorders : cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred • Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : fatigue, malaise • Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock • Nervous System Disorders : dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope • Psychiatric Disorders : As with the other anticholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported.• Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: suppressed lactation • Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : dyspnoea, nasal congestion • Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder : dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Antiglaucoma agents: anticholinergics antagonize antiglaucoma agents and may increase intraoccular pressure (7) • Anticholinergic agents: may affect the gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs; may also increase certain actions or side effects of other anticholinergic drugs (7) • Antacids: interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents (7) 7.1 Antiglaucoma Agents Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. Use of dicyclomine in patients with glaucoma is not recommended [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Other Drugs with Anticholinergic Activity The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs including dicyclomine: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. 7.3 Other Gastrointestinal Motility Drugs Interaction with other gastrointestinal motility drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. 7.4 Effect of Antacids Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents including dicyclomine, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. 7.5 Effect on Absorption of Other Drugs Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs by affecting on gastrointestinal motility, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentration may result. 7.6 Effect on Gastric Acid Secretion The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg 4 times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision Blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • Cardiac Disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias • Eye Disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred • Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: fatigue, malaise • Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock • Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, headache, somnolence, syncope • Psychiatric Disorders: As with the other anticholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. • Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: suppressed lactation • Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion • Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) • Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) • Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine (5.3) • Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) • Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) • Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) • Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) • Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) • Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) • Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications ( )]. 4 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful . [see Contraindications ( )] 4 Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis . [see Adverse Reactions ( )]. 6.3 [see Contraindications ( )] 4 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention . [see Adverse Reactions ( )] 6.3 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "Drug Interactions: The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of Class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS.) Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo.

In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. •Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias •Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred •Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting •General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise •Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock •Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope •Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. •Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation •Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion •Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) • Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) • Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) • Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) • Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) • Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) • Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) • Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) • Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) • Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).

The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence. With the injectable form, there may be temporary sensation of light-headedness. Some local irritation and focal coagulation necrosis may occur following the intramuscular injection of dicyclomine hydrochloride."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie’s syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie’s syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatric Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis and delirium have been reported in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness): signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride’s adverse events (5.10) Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the presence of high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusional state, disorientation, amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis and delirium have been reported in sensitive individuals (such as elderly patients and/or in patients with mental illness) given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)]. Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)]. Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicylomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day) In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face oedema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: As with the other anti-cholinergic drugs, cases of delirium or symptoms of delirium such as amnesia (or transient global amnesia), agitation, confusional state, delusion, disorientation, hallucination (including visual hallucination) as well as mania, mood altered and pseudodementia, have been reported with the use of Dicyclomine. Nervousness and insomnia have also been reported. Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia, Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating,sneezing, throat congestion, impotence.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse effects seen with dicyclomine is mostly related to its pharmacological actions at muscarinic receptors [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. They are a consequence of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system. These effects are dose-related and are usually reversible when treatment is discontinued. The most serious adverse reactions reported with dicyclomine hydrochloride include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,5.3) ]. The most serious adverse reactions include cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms. The most common adverse reactions (>5% of patients) are dizziness, dry mouth, vision blurred, nausea, somnolence, asthenia and nervousness (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect the exposure in controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients treated for functional bowel/irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily (40 mg four times a day). In these trials most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61% of the patients. Table 1 presents adverse reactions (MedDRA 13.0 preferred terms) by decreasing order of frequency in a side-by-side comparison with placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions experienced in controlled clinical trials with decreasing order of frequency MedDRA Preferred Term Dicyclomine Hydrochloride (40 mg four times a day) % Placebo % Dry Mouth 33 5 Dizziness 40 5 Vision blurred 27 2 Nausea 14 6 Somnolence 9 1 Asthenia 7 1 Nervousness 6 2 Nine percent (9%) of patients were discontinued from dicyclomine hydrochloride because of one or more of these side effects (compared with 2% in the placebo group). In 41% of the patients with side effects, side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction. A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46% of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions, presented by system organ class in alphabetical order, have been identified during post approval use of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: palpitations, tachyarrhythmias Eye disorders: cycloplegia, mydriasis, vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, malaise Immune System Disorders: drug hypersensitivity including face edema, angioedema, anaphylactic shock Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, hallucinations insomnia, somnolence, syncope Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: suppressed lactation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnoea, nasal congestion Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: dermatitis allergic, erythema, rash 6.3 Adverse Reactions Reported with Similar Drugs with Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic Action Gastrointestinal: anorexia Central Nervous System: tingling, numbness, dyskinesia, speech disturbance, insomnia Peripheral Nervous System: With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). Ophthalmologic: diplopia, increased ocular tension Dermatologic/Allergic: urticaria, itching, and other dermal manifestations; Genitourinary: urinary hesitancy, urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy Cardiovascular: hypertension Respiratory: apnea Other: decreased sweating, sneezing, throat congestion, impotence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular conditions: worsening of conditions (5.2) Peripheral and central nervous system: heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating); drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted (5.3) Psychosis in patients sensitive to anticholinergic drugs: signs and symptoms resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of dicyclomine hydrochloride (5.3) Myasthenia Gravis: overdose may lead to muscular weakness and paralysis. Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be given to patients with myasthenia gravis only to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase (5.4) Incomplete intestinal obstruction: diarrhea may be an early symptom especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. Treatment with dicyclomine hydrochloride would be inappropriate and possibly fatal (5.5) Salmonella dysenteric patients: due to risk of toxic megacolon (5.6) Ulcerative colitis: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; large doses may suppress intestinal motility or aggravate the serious complications of toxic megacolon (5.7) Prostatic hypertrophy: dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients; may lead to urinary retention (5.8) Hepatic and renal disease: should be used with caution (5.9) Geriatric: use with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to dicyclomine hydrochloride's adverse events (5.10) 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Dicyclomine hydrochloride needs to be used with caution in conditions characterized by tachyarrhythmia such as thyrotoxicosis, congestive heart failure and in cardiac surgery, where they may further accelerate the heart rate. Investigate any tachycardia before administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride. Care is required in patients with coronary heart disease, as ischemia and infarction may be worsened, and in patients with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.3 Peripheral and Central Nervous System The peripheral effects of dicyclomine hydrochloride are a consequence of their inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors of the autonomic nervous system. They include dryness of the mouth with difficulty in swallowing and talking, thirst, reduced bronchial secretions, dilatation of pupils (mydriasis) with loss of accommodation (cycloplegia) and photophobia, flushing and dryness of the skin, transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, with palpitations and arrhythmias, and difficulty in micturition, as well as reduction in the tone and motility of the gastrointestinal tract leading to constipation [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the presence of a high environmental temperature heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). It should also be used cautiously in patients with fever. If symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and supportive measures instituted. Because of the inhibitory effect on muscarinic receptors within the autonomic nervous system, caution should be taken in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Central nervous system (CNS) signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term amnesia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking dicyclomine hydrochloride. 5.4 Myasthenia Gravis With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)] 5.5 Intestinal Obstruction Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)] . Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction. 5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery. 5.7 Ulcerative Colitis Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] 5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment. 5.10 Geriatic Population Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects."
