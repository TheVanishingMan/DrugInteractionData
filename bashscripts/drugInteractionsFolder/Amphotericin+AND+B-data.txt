        "Drug Interactions: No formal clinical studies of drug interactions have been conducted with ABELCET®. However, when administered concomitantly, the following drugs are known to interact with amphotericin B; therefore, the following drugs may interact with ABELCET®: Antineoplastic agents: Concurrent use of antineoplastic agents and amphotericin B may enhance the potential for renal toxicity, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Antineoplastic agents should be given concomitantly with ABELCET® with great caution. Corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH): Concurrent use of corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH) with amphotericin B may potentiate hypokalemia which could predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction. If used concomitantly with ABELCET®, serum electrolytes and cardiac function should be closely monitored. Cyclosporin A: Data from a prospective study of prophylactic ABELCET® in 22 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation suggested that concurrent initiation of cyclosporin A and ABELCET® within several days of bone marrow ablation may be associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Digitalis glycosides: Concurrent use of amphotericin B may induce hypokalemia and may potentiate digitalis toxicity. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET®, serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. Flucytosine: Concurrent use of flucytosine with amphotericin B-containing preparations may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion. Flucytosine should be given concomitantly with ABELCET® with caution. Imidazoles (e.g., ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, etc.): Antagonism between amphotericin B and imidazole derivatives such as miconazole and ketoconazole, which inhibit ergosterol synthesis, has been reported in both in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The clinical significance of these findings has not been determined. Leukocyte transfusions: Acute pulmonary toxicity has been reported in patients receiving intravenous amphotericin B and leukocyte transfusions. Leukocyte transfusions and ABELCET® should not be given concurrently. Other nephrotoxic medications: Concurrent use of amphotericin B and agents such as aminoglcosides and pentamidine may enhance the potential for drug-induced renal toxicity. Aminoglycosides and pentamidine should be used concomitantly with ABELCET® only with great caution. Intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients requiring any combination of nephrotoxic medications. Skeletal muscle relaxants: Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., tubocurarine) due to hypokalemia. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET®, serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. Zidovudine: Increased myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were observed in dogs when either ABELCET® (at doses 0.16 or 0.5 times the recommended human dose) or amphotericin B desoxycholate (at 0.5 times the recommended human dose) were administered concomitantly with zidovudine for 30 days. If zidovudine is used concomitantly with ABELCET®, renal and hematologic function should be closely monitored."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET®, 9% discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET® were transient chills and/or fever during infusion of the drug.

If corticosteroids or corticotropin are used concomitantly with AMPHOTEC, serum electrolytes and cardiac function should be monitored. Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus In the same randomized, double-blind, empiric trial to compare AMPHOTEC and amphotericin B deoxycholate, patients with normal baseline serum creatinine were prospectively enrolled into four strata: adults receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (n=89); or pediatric patients (< 16 years old) receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (n=15); adults not receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (n=75); or pediatric patients not receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (n=34). Patients were assessed for renal toxicity defined as either a doubling or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL or more from baseline serum creatinine, or ≥ 50% decrease from baseline calculated creatinine clearance. Adults and pediatric patients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus in addition to AMPHOTEC had a significantly lower rate of renal toxicity (31%, 16/51), compared to the amphotericin B deoxycholate patients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus (68%, 34/50). In the adults and pediatric patients not receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus, only 8% (4/51) of the AMPHOTEC patients experienced renal toxicity compared to 35% (17/49) of the amphotericin B deoxycholate patients. Digitalis Glycosides Concurrent use of amphotericin B may induce hypokalemia and may potentiate digitalis toxicity.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse events are based on the experience of 572 AMPHOTEC patients from 5 open studies of patients with systemic fungal infections, of whom 526 were treated with a daily dose of 3 - 6 mg/kg. Additionally, comparative adverse event data from 150 AMPHOTEC (4 or 6 mg/kg/day) and 146 amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.8 or 1 mg/kg/day) patients in prospectively randomized doubleblinded studies of empiric treatment of febrile and neutropenic patients or treatment of aspergillosis are also provided. Infusion-related adverse events: Infusion-related adverse events (1 to 3 hours after starting intravenous infusion) occurred most frequently in association with the first infusion of AMPHOTEC. Their frequency and severity decreased with subsequent dosing. Based on the combined non-comparative studies, 35% (197/569) of the patients reported chills or chills and fever, possibly or probably related to AMPHOTEC, on the first day of dosing, compared to 14% (58/422) by the seventh dose. In the comparative studies, a similar decreasing trend was noted for AMPHOTEC and amphotericin B deoxycholate. Adverse events that were considered to be possibly or probably related to AMPHOTEC and that occurred in 5% or more of the patients are summarized in the table below: Summary of Probably and Possibly Related Adverse Events Reported by ≥ 5% of AMPHOTEC Patients Non-Comparative Studies Comparative Studies [a] Adverse Event AMPHOTEC (n=572) % AMPHOTEC Aspergillosis Patients (n=161) % AMPHOTEC (n=150) % Amphotericin B Deoxycholate (n=146) % [a] From AMPHOTEC (4 or 6 mg/kg/day) and amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.8 or 1 mg/kg/day) patients in prospectively randomized double-blinded studies of empiric treatment of febrile and neutropenic patients or treatment of first-line aspergillosis, respectively.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Although some patients may tolerate full intravenous doses of amphotericin B without difficulty, most will exhibit some intolerance, often at less than the full therapeutic dose. Tolerance may be improved by treatment with aspirin, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), antihistamines, or antiemetics. Meperidine (25 to 50 mg IV) has been shown in some patients to decrease the duration of shaking chills and fever that may accompany the infusion of amphotericin B. Administration of amphotericin B on alternate days may decrease anorexia and phlebitis. Intravenous administration of small doses of adrenal corticosteroids just prior to or during the amphotericin B infusion may help decrease febrile reactions. Dosage and duration of such corticosteroid therapy should be kept to a minimum (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Addition of heparin (1000 units per infusion), and the use of a pediatric scalp-vein needle may lessen the incidence of thrombophlebitis. Extravasation may cause chemical irritation. The adverse reactions most commonly observed are: General (body as a whole): fever (sometimes accompanied by shaking chills usually occurring within 15 to 20 minutes after initiation of treatment); malaise; weight loss. Cardiopulmonary: hypotension; tachypnea. Gastrointestinal: anorexia; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; dyspepsia; cramping epigastric pain. Hematologic: normochromic, normocytic anemia. Local: pain at the injection site with or without phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. Musculoskeletal: generalized pain, including muscle and joint pains. Neurologic: headache. Renal: decreased renal function and renal function abnormalities including: azotemia, hypokalemia, hyposthenuria, renal tubular acidosis; and nephrocalcinosis. These usually improve with interruption of therapy. However, some permanent impairment often occurs, especially in those patients receiving large amounts (over 5 g) of amphotericin B or receiving other nephrotoxic agents. In some patients hydration and sodium repletion prior to amphotericin B administration may reduce the risk of developing nephrotoxicity. Supplemental alkali medication may decrease renal tubular acidosis. The following adverse reactions have also been reported: General (body as a whole): flushing. Allergic: anaphylactoid and other allergic reactions; bronchospasm; wheezing. Cardiopulmonary: cardiac arrest; shock; cardiac failure; pulmonary edema; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation; dyspnea; hypertension. Dermatologic: rash, in particular maculopapular; pruritus. Skin exfoliation, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Gastrointestinal: acute liver failure; hepatitis; jaundice; hemorrhagic gastroenteritis; melena. Hematologic: agranulocytosis; coagulation defects; thrombocytopenia; leukopenia; eosinophilia; leukocytosis. Neurologic: convulsions; hearing loss; tinnitus; transient vertigo; visual impairment; diplopia; peripheral neuropathy; encephalopathy (see PRECAUTIONS); other neurologic symptoms. Renal: acute renal failure; anuria; oliguria. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Altered Laboratory Findings Serum Electrolytes: Hypomagnesemia; hypo- and hyperkalemia; hypocalcemia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Renal Function Tests: Elevations of BUN and serum creatinine."

In the empirical therapy study 97-0-034, on Day 1, where no premedication was administered, the overall incidence of infusion related events of chills/rigors was significantly lower for patients administered AmBisome compared with amphotericin B lipid complex. Fever, chills/rigors and hypoxia were significantly lower for each AmBisome group compared with the amphotericin B lipid complex group. The infusion related event hypoxia was reported for 11.5% of amphotericin B lipid complex-treated patients compared with 0% of patients administered 3 mg/kg per day AmBisome and 1.2% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg per day AmBisome.

Patients were not administered premedications to prevent infusion related reactions prior to the Day 1 study drug infusion. In Study 94-0-013, a randomized double-blind multicenter trial comparing AmBisome and amphotericin B deoxycholate as initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, premedications to prevent infusion related reactions were permitted. AmBisome treated patients had a lower incidence of fever, chill/rigors and respiratory adverse events as summarized in the following table: Incidence of Infusion-Related Reactions Study 94-0-013 AmBisome 3 mg/kg AmBisome 6 mg/kg Amphotericin B Total number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 86 94 87 Patients with fever increase of >1ºC 6 (7%) 8 (9%) 24 (28%) Patients with chills/rigors 5 (6%) 8 (9%) 42 (48%) Patients with nausea 11 (13%) 13 (14%) 18 (20%) Patients with vomiting 14 (16%) 13 (14%) 16 (18%) Respiratory adverse events 0 1 (1%) 8 (9%) There have been a few reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with AmBisome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. The symptoms do not occur with every dose and usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in the AmBisome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion related reaction compared with those administered AmBisome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the AmBisome groups. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of AmBisome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a Whole Abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, cellulitis, cell mediated immunological reaction, face edema, graft versus host disease, malaise, neck pain, and procedural complication.

Post-marketing Experience The following infrequent adverse experiences have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, in addition to those mentioned above: angioedema, erythema, urticaria, bronchospasm, cyanosis/hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and rhabdomyolysis. Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of AmBisome on renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar in the AmBisome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients provided the peak creatinine concentration was >1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels ≤2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment. Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and, incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind randomized study were lower in the AmBisome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome Amphotericin B Total number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Nephrotoxicity 64 (18.7%) 116 (33.7%) Mean peak creatinine 1.24 mg/dL 1.52 mg/dL Mean change from baseline in creatinine 0.48 mg/dL 0.77 mg/dL Hypokalemia 23 (6.7%) 40 (11.6%) The effect of AmBisome (3 mg/kg/day) vs. amphotericin B (0.6 mg/kg/day) on renal function in adult patients enrolled in this study is illustrated in the following figure: In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, the incidence of nephrotoxicity as measured by increases of serum creatinine from baseline was significantly lower for patients administered AmBisome (individual dose groups and combined) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex.
