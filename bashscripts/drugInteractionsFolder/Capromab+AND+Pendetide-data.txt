        "Drug Interactions The effect of surgical and/or medical androgen ablation on the imaging performance of Indium In 111 ProstaScint® has not been studied. Preliminary data suggest hormone ablation may increase PSMA expression, with concurrent decrease in tumor expression of PSA.3 The use of ProstaScint® in this patient population cannot be recommended at this time."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ProstaScint® (capromab pendetide) was generally well tolerated in the clinical trials. After administration of 529 single doses of Indium In 111 ProstaScint®, adverse reactions were observed in 4% of patients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were increases in bilirubin, hypotension, and hypertension, which occurred in 1% of patients. Elevated liver enzymes and injection site reactions occurred in slightly less than 1% of patients. Other adverse reactions, listed in order of decreasing frequency, were: pruritus, fever, rash, headache, myalgia, asthenia, burning sensation in thigh, shortness of breath, and alteration of taste. Most adverse reactions were mild and readily reversible. Data from repeat administration in 61 patients revealed a similar incidence of adverse reactions (5%). No deaths were attributable to Indium In 111 ProstaScint® administration."
