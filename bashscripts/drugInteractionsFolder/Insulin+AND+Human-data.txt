        "DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection * 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection* 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Treatment –emergent adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Treatment –emergent adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection* 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tables 5, 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and ≤36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN Trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) The ORIGIN trial was conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular risk, with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or early (antidiabetic drug treatment limited to none or at most one OAD) type 2 diabetes mellitus. It compared once-daily LANTUS to standard management of hyperglycemia (\"Standard Care\"). Overall, severe hypoglycemia was reported for 3.7% of these participants over the course of this 6 year study (approximately 0.6% per participants year) while participants had a median HbA1c below 6.5% throughout follow-up [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 7 displays the incidence and rate (affected participants per 100 participants-years of exposure) of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial. Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial ORIGIN Trial Early Type 2 Diabetes, IFG/IGT at high CV risk Adults 6.2 years LANTUS Standard Care Number of participants with at least one episode (N=total number of participants) 352 (6231) 113 (6273) Number per 100 participant-years 1.05 0.30 Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 8. Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference* , † (SE) 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5%) 71/487 (14.6%) - 2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% Difference = Lantus – NPH using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Never share a NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). •NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product (5.2). •Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2, 5.3). •Insulin, particularly when given in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.4). •Like all insulins, NovoLog Mix 70/30 requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.5, 5.6). •Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.7). •Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.9). 5.1 Never Share a NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Administration The short and long-acting components of insulin mixes, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cannot be titrated independently. Because NovoLog Mix 70/30 has peak pharmacodynamic activity between 1-4 hours after injection, it should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . The dose of insulin required to provide adequate glycemic control for one of the meals may result in hyper- or hypoglycemia for the other meal. The pharmacodynamic profile may also be inadequate for patients who require more frequent meals. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used intravenously. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used in insulin infusion pumps. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. Changes may also be necessary during illness, emotional stress, and other physiologic stress in addition to changes in meals and exercise. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all insulins may be altered by the site used for injection and the degree of vascularization of the site. Smoking, temperature, and exercise contribute to variations in blood flow and insulin absorption. These and other factors contribute to inter- and intra-patient variability. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy, including NovoLog Mix 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog Mix 70/30. The timing of hypoglycemia may reflect the time-action profile of the insulin formulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . Other factors, such as changes in dietary intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g. patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g. patients using potassium-lowering medications or patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations). 5.5 Renal Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of renal impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions- As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of NovoLog Mix 70/30 injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog Mix 70/30. In some instances, these reactions may be related to the insulin molecule, other components in the insulin preparation including protamine and cresol, components in skin cleansing agents, or injection techniques. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient. Systemic Reactions- Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life threatening. 5.8 Antibody Production Specific anti-insulin antibodies as well as cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies were monitored in a 3-month, open-label comparator trial as well as in a long-term extension trial. Changes in cross-reactive antibodies were more common after NovoLog Mix 70/30 than with Novolin 70/30 but these changes did not correlate with change in HbA1c or increase in insulin dose. In this study, antibodies did not increase further after long-term exposure (>6 months) to NovoLog Mix 70/30. The presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency towards hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 5.9 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure Can Occur with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

Talk to your healthcare provider if low blood sugar is a problem for you. • Serious allergic reaction (whole body reaction). Get medical help right away if you develop a rash over your whole body, have trouble breathing, a fast heartbeat, or sweating. • Reactions at the injection site (local allergic reaction). You may get redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site. If you keep having skin reactions, or they are serious, talk to your healthcare provider. You may need to stop using Novolin ® 70/30 and use a different insulin. Do not inject insulin into skin that is red, swollen, or itchy. • Skin thickens or pits at the injection site (lipodystrophy). Change (rotate) where you inject your insulin to help prevent these skin changes from happening. Do not inject insulin into this type of skin. • Swelling of your hands and feet • Heart Failure. Taking certain diabetes pills called thiazolidinediones or “TZDs” with Novolin ® 70/30 may cause heart failure in some people. This can happen even if you have never had heart failure or heart problems before. If you already have heart failure it may get worse while you take TZDs with Novolin ® 70/30. Your healthcare provider should monitor you closely while you are taking TZDs with Novolin ® 70/30. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worse symptoms of heart failure including:∘shortness of breath∘swelling of your ankles or feet∘sudden weight gain Treatment with TZDs and Novolin® 70/30 may need to be adjusted or stopped by your healthcare provider if you have new or worse heart failure. • Vision changes • Low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia) These are not all of the possible side effects from Novolin® 70/30.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following: Body as Whole: allergic reactions (see PRECAUTIONS, Allergy). Skin and Appendages: lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash. Mild injection site reactions occurred more frequently with LEVEMIR than with NPH human insulin and usually resolved in a few days to a few weeks (see PRECAUTIONS, Allergy). Other: Hypoglycemia: (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia with LEVEMIR was comparable to the incidence with NPH, and, as expected, greater overall in patients with type 1 diabetes (Table 4). Weight gain: In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, LEVEMIR was associated with somewhat less weight gain than NPH (Table 4). Whether these observed differences represent true differences in the effects of LEVEMIR and NPH insulin is not known, since these trials were not blinded and the protocols (e.g., diet and exercise instructions and monitoring) were not specifically directed at exploring hypotheses related to weight effects of the treatments compared. The clinical significance of the observed differences has not been established.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. • Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NovoLog [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. • Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. • Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including NovoLog, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. • Weight gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies, including NovoLog, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. • Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. • Frequencies of adverse drug reactions The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during NovoLog clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Adverse events with frequency ≥ 5% and occurring more frequently with NovoLog compared to human regular insulin are listed) NovoLog + NPH N= 596 Human Regular Insulin + NPH N= 286 Preferred Term N (%) N (%) HypoglycemiaHypoglycemia is defined as an episode of blood glucose concentration <45 mg/dL, with or without symptoms.

Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NovoLog have been identified during post-approval use [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Adverse reactions observed with NovoLog include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6).

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Never share a NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog FlexTouch, PenFill cartridge, or Penfill cartridge compatible insulin delivery device between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). •Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2, 5.3). •Insulin, particularly when given intravenously or in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.4). •Like all insulins, NovoLog requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.5, 5.6). •Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog (5.7). •Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including NovoLog (5.11). 5.1 Never Share a NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog FlexTouch, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Compatible Insulin Delivery Device Between Patients NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog FlexTouch, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge compatible insulin delivery devices must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Administration NovoLog has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin. An injection of NovoLog should immediately be followed by a meal within 5-10 minutes. Because of NovoLog’s short duration of action, a longer acting insulin should also be used in patients with type 1 diabetes and may also be needed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes and is particularly important for patients using external pump infusion therapy. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of NovoLog action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including NovoLog. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring more close monitoring for hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations, and patients receiving intravenously administered insulin). 5.5 Renal Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions - As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of NovoLog injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol, which is an excipient in NovoLog. Systemic Reactions - Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin product, including NovoLog. Anaphylactic reactions with NovoLog have been reported post-approval. Generalized allergy to insulin may also cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials, allergic reactions were reported in 3 of 735 patients (0.4%) treated with regular human insulin and 10 of 1394 patients (0.7%) treated with NovoLog. In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 3 of 2341 (0.1%) NovoLog-treated patients discontinued due to allergic reactions. 5.8 Antibody Production Increases in anti-insulin antibody titers that react with both human insulin and insulin aspart have been observed in patients treated with NovoLog. Increases in anti-insulin antibodies are observed more frequently with NovoLog than with regular human insulin. Data from a 12-month controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes suggest that the increase in these antibodies is transient, and the differences in antibody levels between the regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups observed at 3 and 6 months were no longer evident at 12 months. In this study these antibodies did not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency towards hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 5.9 Mixing of Insulins •Mixing NovoLog with NPH human insulin immediately before injection attenuates the peak concentration of NovoLog, without significantly affecting the time to peak concentration or total bioavailability of NovoLog. If NovoLog is mixed with NPH human insulin, NovoLog should be drawn into the syringe first, and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. •The efficacy and safety of mixing NovoLog with insulin preparations produced by other manufacturers have not been studied. •Insulin mixtures should not be administered intravenously. 5.10 Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion by External Pump When used in an external subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, NovoLog should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluent. When using NovoLog in an external insulin pump, the NovoLog-specific information should be followed (e.g., in-use time, frequency of changing infusion sets) because NovoLog-specific information may differ from general pump manual instructions. Pump or infusion set malfunctions or insulin degradation can lead to a rapid onset of hyperglycemia and ketosis because of the small subcutaneous depot of insulin. This is especially pertinent for rapid-acting insulin analogs that are more rapidly absorbed through skin and have a shorter duration of action. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy with subcutaneous injection may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.9 , 5.10), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. NovoLog should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 37°C (98.6°F). NovoLog that will be used in a pump should not be mixed with other insulin or with a diluent [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.10), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.11 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NovoLog, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: •Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] •Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with TRESIBA are: •hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of TRESIBA was evaluated in nine treat to target trials of 6-12 months duration, conducted in subjects with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 1102 patients with type 1 diabetes to TRESIBA with a mean exposure duration to TRESIBA of 34 weeks. The mean age was 43 years and 1% were older than 75 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 81% were White, 2% were Black or African American and 4% were Hispanic. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 18 years and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.8%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported in 11%, 16%, 7% and 0.5% respectively. The mean eGFR at baseline was 87 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 7% of the patients had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 2713 patients with type 2 diabetes to TRESIBA with a mean exposure duration to TRESIBA of 36 weeks. The mean age was 58 years and 3% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent were male, 71% were White, 7% were Black or African American and 13% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 30 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.3%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported for 14%, 10%, 6% and 0.6% of participants respectively. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 83 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 9% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia)occurring in TRESIBA treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in ≥5% of the population studied. Hypoglycemia is not shown in these tables but discussed in a dedicated subsection below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥5% of TRESIBA-Treated Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adverse Reaction TRESIBA (n=1102) Nasopharyngitis 23.9 % Upper respiratory tract infection 11.9 % Headache 11.8 % Sinusitis 5.1 % Gastroenteritis 5.1 % Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥5% of TRESIBA-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adverse Reaction TRESIBA (n=2713) Nasopharyngitis 12.9 % Headache 8.8 % Upper respiratory tract infection 8.4 % Diarrhea 6.3 % Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including TRESIBA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for TRESIBA with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. The percent of participants randomized to TRESIBA who experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia in adult clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively, are shown in Table 3 and 4. No clinically important differences in risk of hypoglycemia between TRESIBA and comparators was observed in clinical trials. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. A Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia episode was defined as a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where a laboratory or a self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL or where a whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL (i.e., with or without the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms). Table 3: Percent (%) of Type 1 Diabetes Patients Experiencing at Least One Episode of Severe Hypoglycemia or Novo Nordisk Hypoglycemia§ on TRESIBA in Adult Clinical Trials Study A + insulin aspart 52 weeks Study B + insulin aspart 26 weeks Study C + insulin aspart 26 weeks TRESIBA (N=472) TRESIBA (N=301) TRESIBA at the same time each day (N=165) TRESIBA at alternating times (N=164) Severe hypoglycemia Percent of patients 12.3% 10.6% 12.7% 10.4% Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia§ Percent of patients 95.6% 93.0% 99.4% 93.9% § Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia: a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where a laboratory or a self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL or where a whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL (i.e., with or without the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms).

Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including TRESIBA and may be life threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, and itching) and urticaria were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including TRESIBA, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue) and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical program, lipodystrophy, lipohypertrophy, or lipoatrophy was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Injection Site Reactions Patients taking TRESIBA may experience injection site reactions, including injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoloration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass. In the clinical program, injection site reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including TRESIBA, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin. In the clinical program after 52 weeks of treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes treated with TRESIBA gained an average of 1.8 kg and patients with type 2 diabetes treated with TRESIBA gained an average of 3.0 kg. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including TRESIBA, may cause sodium retention and edema. In the clinical program, peripheral edema occurred in 0.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 3.0% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with TRESIBA. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TRESIBA with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, may be misleading. In studies of type 1 diabetes patients, 95.9% of patients who received TRESIBA once daily were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the studies, including 89.7% that were positive at baseline. In studies of type 2 diabetes patients, 31.5% of patients who received TRESIBA once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the studies, including 14.5% that were positive at baseline. The antibody incidence rates for type 2 diabetes may be underreported due to potential assay interference by endogenous insulin in samples in these patients. The presence of antibodies that affect clinical efficacy may necessitate dose adjustments to correct for tendencies toward hyper or hypoglycemia. The incidence of anti-insulin degludec antibodies has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Never share a TRESIBA FlexTouch pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). • Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2). • Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3, 5.4, 6.1). • Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. DO NOT transfer TRESIBA into a syringe for administration as overdosage and severe hypoglycemia can result (5.4). • Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue TRESIBA, monitor and treat if indicated (5.5). • Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6). • Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7). 5.1 Never Share a TRESIBA FlexTouch Pen Between Patients TRESIBA FlexTouch disposable prefilled pens should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment may be needed. When converting from other insulin therapies to TRESIBA follow dosing recommendations [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including TRESIBA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). TRESIBA, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of TRESIBA may vary among different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between TRESIBA and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. Do not transfer TRESIBA from the TRESIBA pen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including TRESIBA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue TRESIBA; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. TRESIBA is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin degludec or one of the excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including TRESIBA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Congestive Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of a PPAR Gamma Agonist Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists can cause dose related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including TRESIBA and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Adverse reactions commonly associated with LANTUS include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi- aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2327 patients with type 1 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 38.5 years. Fifty four percent were male, 96.9% were Caucasian, 1.8 % were Black or African American and 2.7 % were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 25.1 kg/m 2. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1563 patients with type 2 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59.3 years. Fifty eight percent were male, 86.7% were Caucasian, 7.8 % were Black or African American and 9 % were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2. The frequencies of adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body System not Specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body System not Specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5% ) LANTUS, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection Body System not Specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Tables 5, and 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and ≤36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Percentages of LANTUS-treated adult patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS N=292 NPH N=293 LANTUS N=264 NPH N=270 LANTUS N=310 NPH N=309 LANTUS N=174 NPH N=175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS N=289 NPH N=281 LANTUS N=259 NPH N=259 LANTUS N=513 NPH N=504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial ORIGIN Trial Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years LANTUS N=6231 Standard Care N=6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking LANTUS have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including LANTUS, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including LANTUS and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and LANTUS treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. The long-acting effect of LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. 5.4 Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products, particularly between long-acting insulins and rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue LANTUS; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . LANTUS is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [ see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including LANTUS, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LANTUS, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. • Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NovoLog [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions (5) • Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. • Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including NovoLog, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. • Weight gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies, including NovoLog, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. • Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. • Frequencies of adverse drug reactions The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during NovoLog clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision ( , ). • 5.1 5.2 Insulin, particularly when given intravenously or in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia ). • (5.3 Like all insulins, NovoLog requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment , ). • (5.4 5.5 Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog ( ). • 5.6 Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including NovoLog ( ). • 5.10 5.1 Administration NovoLog has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin. An injection of NovoLog should immediately be followed by a meal within 5-10 minutes. Because of NovoLog’s short duration of action, a longer acting insulin should also be used in patients with type 1 diabetes and may also be needed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes and is particularly important for patients using external pump infusion therapy. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of NovoLog action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. Needles, NovoLog FlexPen and NovoLog FlexTouch must not be shared. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including NovoLog. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations [ ]. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ ]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. see Clinical Pharmacology (12) see Drug Interactions (7) Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [ ]. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring more close monitoring for hypoglycemia. see Drug Interactions (7) 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations, and patients receiving intravenously administered insulin). 5.4 Renal Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [ ]. see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.5 Hepatic Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [ ]. see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions - As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of NovoLog injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol, which is an excipient in NovoLog. Local Reactions - Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin product, including NovoLog. Anaphylactic reactions with NovoLog have been reported post-approval. Generalized allergy to insulin may also cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials, allergic reactions were reported in 3 of 735 patients (0.4%) treated with regular human insulin and 10 of 1394 patients (0.7%) treated with NovoLog. In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 3 of 2341 (0.1%) NovoLog-treated patients discontinued due to allergic reactions. Systemic Reactions 5.7 Antibody Production Increases in anti-insulin antibody titers that react with both human insulin and insulin aspart have been observed in patients treated with NovoLog. Increases in anti-insulin antibodies are observed more frequently with NovoLog than with regular human insulin. Data from a 12-month controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes suggest that the increase in these antibodies is transient, and the differences in antibody levels between the regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups observed at 3 and 6 months were no longer evident at 12 months. In this study these antibodies did not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency towards hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 5.8 Mixing of Insulins Mixing NovoLog with NPH human insulin immediately before injection attenuates the peak concentration of NovoLog, without significantly affecting the time to peak concentration or total bioavailability of NovoLog. If NovoLog is mixed with NPH human insulin, NovoLog should be drawn into the syringe first, and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. • The efficacy and safety of mixing NovoLog with insulin preparations produced by other manufacturers have not been studied. • Insulin mixtures should not be administered intravenously. • 5.9 Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion by External Pump When using NovoLog in an external insulin pump, the NovoLog-specific information should be followed (e.g., in-use time, frequency of changing infusion sets) because NovoLog-specific information may differ from general pump manual instructions. When used in an external subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, NovoLog should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluent. Pump or infusion set malfunctions or insulin degradation can lead to a rapid onset of hyperglycemia and ketosis because of the small subcutaneous depot of insulin. This is especially pertinent for rapid-acting insulin analogs that are more rapidly absorbed through skin and have a shorter duration of action. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy with subcutaneous injection may be required [ ]. see , , , and Dosage and Administration (2.3) Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9) How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) Patient Counseling Information (17.2) NovoLog should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 37°C (98.6°F). [ ]. NovoLog that will be used in a pump should not be mixed with other insulin or with a diluent see , , and Dosage and Administration (2.3) Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) Patient Counseling Information (17.2) 5.10 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NovoLog, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.

Tables 5, and 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and ≤36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. [See ] Warnings and Precautions (5.3) The proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [ ] in adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were comparable for all treatment regimens (see and ). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. See Clinical Studies (14) Tables 5 6 Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [ ]. see Adverse Reactions (cardiovascular safety) Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years ORIGIN Trial LANTUS Standard Care Percent of patients (n/total N) 5.6 (352/6231) 1.8 (113/6273) Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 8 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 8: Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference (SE) Difference = Lantus – NPH , using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5%) 71/487 (14.6%) - 2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See ]. Dosage and Administration (2.1) Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. Cardiovascular Safety The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 2-by-2, factorial design study. One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of LANTUS to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12,537 participants ≥ 50 years of age with abnormal glucose levels [i.e., impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)] or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular (i.e., CV) disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that LANTUS use could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care. Two co-primary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN. The first co-primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The second co-primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Participants were randomized to either LANTUS (N=6264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N=6273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of participants were 75 years of age or older. The majority of participants were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were Caucasian, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m . Approximately 12% of participants had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors. 2 Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of participants randomized to LANTUS and standard care respectively at end of trial. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years [range: 8 days to 7.9 years]. The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the trial was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the LANTUS and standard care group respectively. The median dose of LANTUS at end of trial was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to LANTUS were using LANTUS at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the LANTUS group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was similar between groups (see ). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection. [See Patient Counseling Information (17)"

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Modify insulin regimen cautiously and only under medical supervision ( ) 5.1 Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur ( ) 5.2 Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients ( ) 5.2 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor glucose, administer rescue therapy and treat underlying cause.( , ) 5.3 6.1 Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue LANTUS. monitor and treat if indicated ( , ) 5.4 6.1 Renal or hepatic impairment: Reduce dose of LANTUS if indicated ( , ) 5.5 5.6 : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs ( ) Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) 5.8 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia . [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ ]. See Drug Interactions (7) The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.3) As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See ]. Drug Interactions (7) 5.8 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LANTUS, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMULIN 70/30. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking HUMULIN 70/30 have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Peripheral Edema Some patients taking HUMULIN 70/30 have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including HUMULIN 70/30, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] in some patients. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including HUMULIN 70/30 and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a HUMULIN 70/30 pen, HUMULIN 70/30 KwikPen, or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. (5.1) Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage, use of glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness.

Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.5) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.6) HUMULIN 70/30 pens and HUMULIN 70/30 KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMULIN 70/30 vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including HUMULIN 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN 70/30 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMULIN 70/30. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN 70/30; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. HUMULIN 70/30 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMULIN 70/30 or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. All insulin products, including HUMULIN 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN 70/30, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Acute bronchospasm in patients with chronic lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Decline in pulmonary function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Lung cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Diabetic ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions associated with AFREZZA (2% or greater incidence) are hypoglycemia, cough, and throat pain or irritation (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at (1-800-633-1610) or FDA at (1-800-FDA-1088) or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the incidence of adverse reactions reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to the incidence reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect what is observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure of 3017 patients to AFREZZA and include 1026 patients with type 1 diabetes and 1991 patients with type 2 diabetes. The mean exposure duration was 8.17 months for the overall population and 8.16 months and 8.18 months for type 1 and 2 diabetes patients, respectively. In the overall population, 1874 were exposed to AFREZZA for 6 months and 724 for greater than one year. 620 and 1254 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, were exposed to AFREZZA for up to 6 months. 238 and 486 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, were exposed to AFREZZA for greater than one year (median exposure = 1.8 years). AFREZZA was studied in placebo and active-controlled trials (n = 3 and n = 10, respectively). The mean age of the population was 50.2 years and 20 patients were older than 75 years of age. 50.8% of the population were men; 82.6% were White, 1.8% were Asian, and 4.9% were Black or African American. 9.7% were Hispanic. At baseline, the type 1 diabetes population had diabetes for an average of 16.6 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8.3%, and the type 2 diabetes population had diabetes for an average of 10.7 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8.8%. At baseline, 33.4% of the population reported peripheral neuropathy, 32.0% reported retinopathy and 19.6% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of AFREZZA in the pool of controlled trials in type 2 diabetes patients. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on AFREZZA than on placebo and/or comparator and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with AFREZZA. Table 1. Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (excluding Hypoglycemia) Treated with AFREZZA PlaceboCarrier particle without insulin was used as placebo [see Description (11) ].

The incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia of AFREZZA versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes is shown in Table 3. A hypoglycemic episode was recorded if a patient reported symptoms of hypoglycemia with or without a blood glucose value consistent with hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose value consistent with hypoglycemia or prompt recovery after treatment for hypoglycemia. Table 3. Incidence of Severe and Non-Severe Hypoglycemia in a Placebo-Controlled Study of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Placebo (N=176) AFREZZA (N=177) Severe Hypoglycemia 1.7% 5.1% Non-Severe Hypoglycemia 30% 67% Cough Approximately 27% of patients treated with AFREZZA reported cough, compared to approximately 5.2% of patients treated with comparator. In clinical trials, cough was the most common reason for discontinuation of AFREZZA therapy (2.8% of AFREZZA-treated patients). Pulmonary Function Decline In clinical trials lasting up to 2 years, excluding patients with chronic lung disease, patients treated with AFREZZA had a 40 mL (95% CI: -80, -1) greater decline from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared to patients treated with comparator anti-diabetes treatments. The decline occurred during the first 3 months of therapy and persisted over 2 years (Figure 2). A decline in FEV1 of ≥ 15% occurred in 6% of AFREZZA-treated subjects compared to 3% of comparator-treated subjects. Figure 2. Mean (+/-SE) Change in FEV1 (Liters) from Baseline for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Patients Figure 2 Weight Gain Weight gain may occur with some insulin therapies, including AFREZZA. Weight gain has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], there was a mean 0.49 kg weight gain among AFREZZA-treated patients compared with a mean 1.13 kg weight loss among placebo-treated patients. Antibody Production Increases in anti-insulin antibody concentrations have been observed in patients treated with AFREZZA. Increases in anti-insulin antibodies are observed more frequently with AFREZZA than with subcutaneously injected mealtime insulins. Presence of antibody did not correlate with reduced efficacy, as measured by HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, or specific adverse reactions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Bronchospasm: Acute bronchospasm has been observed in patients with asthma and COPD. Before initiating, perform spirometry (FEV1) in all patients. Do not use in patients with chronic lung disease (2.5, 4, 5.1) Change in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 6, 7, 8.6, 8.7) Decline in Pulmonary Function: Assess pulmonary function (e.g., spirometry) before initiating, after 6 months of therapy, and annually, even in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. (2.5, 5.4) Lung Cancer: AFREZZA should not be used in patients with active lung cancer. In patients with a history of lung cancer or at risk for lung cancer, the benefit of AFREZZA use should outweigh this potential risk. (5.5) Diabetic Ketoacidosis: More patients using AFREZZA experienced diabetic ketoacidosis in clinical trials. In patients at risk for DKA, monitor and change to alternate route of insulin delivery, if indicated. (5.6) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including AFREZZA. Discontinue AFREZZA, monitor and treat if indicated. (5.7) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.8) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.9) 5.1 Acute Bronchospasm in Patients with Chronic Lung Disease Because of the risk of acute bronchospasm, AFREZZA is contraindicated in patients with chronic lung disease such as asthma or COPD [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with AFREZZA, evaluate all patients with a medical history, physical examination and spirometry (FEV1) to identify potential underlying lung disease. Acute bronchospasm has been observed following AFREZZA dosing in patients with asthma and patients with COPD. In a study of patients with asthma, bronchoconstriction and wheezing following AFREZZA dosing was reported in 29% (5 out of 17) and 0% (0 out of 13) of patients with and without a diagnosis of asthma, respectively. In this study, a mean decline in FEV1 of 400 mL was observed 15 minutes after a single dose in patients with asthma. In a study of patients with COPD (n=8), a mean decline in FEV1 of 200 mL was observed 18 minutes after a single dose of AFREZZA. The long-term safety and efficacy of AFREZZA in patients with chronic lung disease has not been established. 5.2 Changes in Insulin Regimen Glucose monitoring is essential for patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including AFREZZA. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. AFREZZA has a distinct time action profile [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)], which impacts the timing of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ across individuals and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using certain medications [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Decline in Pulmonary Function AFREZZA causes a decline in lung function over time as measured by FEV1. In clinical trials excluding patients with chronic lung disease and lasting up to 2 years, AFREZZA-treated patients experienced a small [40 mL (95% CI: -80, -1)] but greater FEV1 decline than comparator-treated patients. The FEV1 decline was noted within the first 3 months, and persisted for the entire duration of therapy (up to 2 years of observation). In this population, the annual rate of FEV1 decline did not appear to worsen with increased duration of use. The effects of AFREZZA on pulmonary function for treatment duration longer than 2 years has not been established. There are insufficient data in long term studies to draw conclusions regarding reversal of the effect on FEV1 after discontinuation of AFREZZA. The observed changes in FEV1 were similar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Assess pulmonary function (e.g., spirometry) at baseline, after the first 6 months of therapy, and annually thereafter, even in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. In patients who have a decline of ≥ 20% in FEV1 from baseline, consider discontinuing AFREZZA. Consider more frequent monitoring of pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary symptoms such as wheezing, bronchospasm, breathing difficulties, or persistent or recurring cough. If symptoms persist, discontinue AFREZZA. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Lung Cancer In clinical trials, two cases of lung cancer, one in controlled trials and one in uncontrolled trials (2 cases in 2,750 patient-years of exposure), were observed in participants exposed to AFREZZA while no cases of lung cancer were observed in comparators (0 cases in 2,169 patient-years of exposure). In both cases, a prior history of heavy tobacco use was identified as a risk factor for lung cancer. Two additional cases of lung cancer (squamous cell) occurred in non-smokers exposed to AFREZZA and were reported by investigators after clinical trial completion. These data are insufficient to determine whether AFREZZA has an effect on lung or respiratory tract tumors. In patients with active lung cancer, a prior history of lung cancer, or in patients at risk for lung cancer, consider whether the benefits of AFREZZA use outweigh this potential risk. 5.6 Diabetic Ketoacidosis In clinical trials enrolling subjects with type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was more common in subjects receiving AFREZZA (0.43%; n=13) than in subjects receiving comparators (0.14%; n=3). In patients at risk for DKA, such as those with an acute illness or infection, increase the frequency of glucose monitoring and consider delivery of insulin using an alternate route of administration if indicated [see Limitations of Use (1)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including AFREZZA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue AFREZZA, treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. AFREZZA is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to AFREZZA or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.8 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including AFREZZA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations and patients receiving intravenously administered insulin). 5.9 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including AFREZZA, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Novolin R [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5.2 • Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. • Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Novolin R, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. • Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapies, including Novolin R, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. • Peripheral edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually transitory. • Allergic reactions As with other insulins, Novolin R can cause injection site reactions. Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis may occur with any insulin, including Novolin R [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5.6 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening. Closely monitor blood glucose. Changes in insulin or dosage should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision ( ). • 5.2 Hypokalemia: Particularly when insulin is given intravenously or in settings of poor glycemic control. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia ( ). • 5.3 Renal or hepatic impairment: As with other insulins, the dose requirements for Novolin R may be reduced ( ). • 5.5 Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur ( ). • 5.6 Mixing: Do not mix Novolin R with any insulin for intravenous use. Do not mix with insulins other than NPH insulin for subcutaneous use ( ). • 5.7 Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including Novolin R ( ). • 5.9 5.1 Administration Subcutaneous injection of Novolin R should be followed by a meal. Patients should wait approximately 30 minutes after injection before starting the meal [ ]. see Dosage and Administration ( ) 2.2 Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of Novolin R action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including dosage, the site of injection, local blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies, including Novolin R. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness, convulsions, temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person, parenteral glucose infusion, and glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Novolin R. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations [ ]. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ ]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake, pediatric patients, and the elderly). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. see Clinical Pharmacology ( , ) 12.2 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) 7 Rapid changes in serum glucose concentrations may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [ ]. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring more close monitoring for hypoglycemia. see Drug Interactions ( ) 7 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Novolin R, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications and patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). Monitor glucose and potassium frequently when Novolin R is administered intravenously. 5.4 Hyperglycemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Non-Ketotic Syndrome Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome may develop in patients who take less insulin than needed to control blood glucose. These conditions can be precipitated by illness, infection, dietary indiscretion, or omission or improper administration of the prescribed insulin dose. 5.5 Renal or Hepatic Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for Novolin R may be reduced in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions - As with other insulins, patients may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection of Novolin R. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of Novolin R. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of meta-cresol, which is an excipient in Novolin R. Local Reactions - Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis may occur with any insulin, including Novolin R. Generalized allergy to insulin may manifest as a whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension tachycardia, or diaphoresis. Systemic Reactions , 5.7 Mixing of Insulins If Novolin R is mixed with NPH human insulin, Novolin R should be drawn into the syringe first and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. Insulin mixtures should not be administered intravenously. 5.8 Antibody Production Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed in patients treated with Novolin R. Data from a 12-month controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes suggest that the increase in these antibodies is transient. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known but does not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 5.9 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NOVOLIN R, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)] and [Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product (5.1). Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1,5.2). Insulin, particularly when given in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.3). Like all insulins, NovoLog Mix 70/30 requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.4, 5.5). Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.6). 5.1 Administration The short and long-acting components of insulin mixes, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cannot be titrated independently. Because NovoLog Mix 70/30 has peak pharmacodynamic activity between 1-4 hours after injection, it should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . The dose of insulin required to provide adequate glycemic control for one of the meals may result in hyper- or hypoglycemia for the other meal. The pharmacodynamic profile may also be inadequate for patients who require more frequent meals. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used intravenously. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used in insulin infusion pumps. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. Changes may also be necessary during illness, emotional stress, and other physiologic stress in addition to changes in meals and exercise. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all insulins may be altered by the site used for injection and the degree of vascularization of the site. Smoking, temperature, and exercise contribute to variations in blood flow and insulin absorption. These and other factors contribute to inter- and intra-patient variability. Needles and NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen must not be shared. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy, including NovoLog Mix 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog Mix 70/30. The timing of hypoglycemia may reflect the time-action profile of the insulin formulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . Other factors, such as changes in dietary intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g. patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g. patients using potassium-lowering medications or patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations). 5.4 Renal Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of renal impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.5 Hepatic Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions- As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of NovoLog Mix 70/30 injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog Mix 70/30. In some instances, these reactions may be related to the insulin molecule, other components in the insulin preparation including protamine and cresol, components in skin cleansing agents, or injection techniques. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient. Systemic Reactions- Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life threatening. 5.7 Antibody Production Specific anti-insulin antibodies as well as cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies were monitored in a 3-month, open-label comparator trial as well as in a long-term extension trial. Changes in cross-reactive antibodies were more common after NovoLog Mix 70/30 than with Novolin 70/30 but these changes did not correlate with change in HbA1c or increase in insulin dose. The clinical significance of these antibodies has not been established. Antibodies did not increase further after long-term exposure (>6 months) to NovoLog Mix 70/30."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent adverse events experienced by insulin users. Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia may occur suddenly and can include: sweating drowsiness dizziness sleep disturbances palpitation anxiety tremor blurred vision hunger slurred speech restlessness depressed mood tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue irritability lightheadedness abnormal behavior inability to concentrate unsteady movement headache personality changes Signs of severe hypoglycemia can include: disorientation seizures unconsciousness coma death Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, autonomic diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-adrenergic blockers, changing insulin preparations, or intensified control (3 or more insulin injections per day) of diabetes. Without recognition of early warning symptoms, the patient may not be able to take steps to avoid more serious hypoglycemia. Patients who experience hypoglycemia without early warning symptoms should monitor their blood glucose more frequently, especially prior to activities such as driving. Mild to moderate hypoglycemia may be treated by eating foods or taking drinks that contain sugar. Patients should always carry a quick source of sugar, such as hard candy, non-diet carbohydrate-containing drinks or glucose tablets. Hypokalemia See Precautions Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously can result in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue). Allergy Local Allergy – Patients occasionally experience erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. This condition usually is self-limiting. In some instances, this condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy – Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) may be life threatening. Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Novolin R [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. • Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. • Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Novolin R, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. • Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapies, including Novolin R, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. • Peripheral edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually transitory. • Allergic reactions As with other insulins, Novolin R can cause injection site reactions. Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis may occur with any insulin, including Novolin R [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes The incidence of adverse reactions during clinical trials comparing Novolin R and insulin aspart in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in a 24-Week Trial Comparing Novolin R and Insulin Aspart in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Also Treated with NPH Insulin (adverse reactions with an incidence ≥ 5% in the Novolin R treatment group are listed) Novolin R + NPH N= 286 Insulin aspart + NPH N=596 % % HypoglycemiaHypoglycemia was defined as an episode of blood glucose concentration <45 mg/dL, with or without symptoms. 72 75 Table 2: Adverse Reactions in a 24-Week Trial Comparing Novolin R and Insulin Aspart in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Also Treated with NPH Insulin (adverse reactions with an incidence ≥ 5% in the Novolin R treatment group are listed) Novolin R + NPH N= 91 Insulin aspart + NPH N= 91 (%) (%) HypoglycemiaHypoglycemia was defined as an episode of blood glucose concentration <45 mg/dL, with or without symptoms. 36 27 Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes The incidence of adverse reactions during a 24-week clinical trial comparing Novolin R and insulin aspart in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are listed in the table below.

Tables 4 and 5 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the Novolin R clinical trials. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring intervention of another person or hospitalization. The rates of severe hypoglycemia in the Novolin R clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 4 and 5).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening. Closely monitor blood glucose. Changes in insulin or dosage should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2). •Hypokalemia: Particularly when insulin is given intravenously or in settings of poor glycemic control. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.3). •Renal or hepatic impairment: As with other insulins, the dose requirements for Novolin R may be reduced (5.5). •Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur (5.6). •Mixing: Do not mix Novolin R with any insulin for intravenous use. Do not mix with insulins other than NPH insulin for subcutaneous use (5.7). •Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including Novolin R (5.9). 5.1 Administration Subcutaneous injection of Novolin R should be followed by a meal. Patients should wait approximately 30 minutes after injection before starting the meal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of Novolin R action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including dosage, the site of injection, local blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies, including Novolin R. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness, convulsions, temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person, parenteral glucose infusion, and glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Novolin R. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)]. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake, pediatric patients, and the elderly). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose concentrations may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [see Drug Interactions (7)]. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring more close monitoring for hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Novolin R, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications and patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). Monitor glucose and potassium frequently when Novolin R is administered intravenously. 5.4 Hyperglycemia, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Non-Ketotic Syndrome Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome may develop in patients who take less insulin than needed to control blood glucose. These conditions can be precipitated by illness, infection, dietary indiscretion, or omission or improper administration of the prescribed insulin dose. 5.5 Renal or Hepatic Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for Novolin R may be reduced in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions - As with other insulins, patients may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection of Novolin R. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of Novolin R. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of meta-cresol, which is an excipient in Novolin R. Systemic Reactions - Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis may occur with any insulin, including Novolin R. Generalized allergy to insulin may manifest as a whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. 5.7 Mixing of Insulins If Novolin R is mixed with NPH human insulin, Novolin R should be drawn into the syringe first and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. Insulin mixtures should not be administered intravenously. 5.8 Antibody Production Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed in patients treated with Novolin R. Data from a 12-month controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes suggest that the increase in these antibodies is transient. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known but does not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 5.9 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NOVOLIN R, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

In some instances, this condition may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy – Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, fast pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) may be life threatening. Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Drug Interactions A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. Drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of Humulin R U-100 and susceptibility to hypoglycemia: Oral antihyperglycemic agents, salicylates, sulfa antibiotics, certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, beta-adrenergic blockers, inhibitors of pancreatic function (e.g., octreotide), and alcohol. Drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect: Corticosteroids, isoniazid, certain lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., niacin), estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents, somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors and thyroid replacement therapy. Drugs that may increase or decrease blood-glucose-lowering effect: Beta-adrenergic blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Drugs that may mask the signs of hypoglycemia: Beta-adrenergic blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism and may necessitate insulin dose adjustment. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine). (7.3, 7.4) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with HUMULIN R U-500 use may be increased with antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN R U-500 The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN R U-500 may be decreased when co-administered with atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline) and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN R U-500 The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN R U-500 may be increased or decreased when co-administered with alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and lithium salts. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.4 Drugs That May Affect Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are co-administered with HUMULIN R U-500."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMULIN R U-500. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with HUMULIN R U-500 include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500 and may be life threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue) and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injections sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Injection Site Reactions Patients taking HUMULIN R U-500 may experience injection site reactions, including injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoloration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass. Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including HUMULIN R U-500, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. The presence of antibodies that affect clinical efficacy may necessitate dose adjustments to correct for tendencies toward hyper- or hypoglycemia. The incidence of antibody formation with HUMULIN R U-500 is unknown."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperglycemia, Hypoglycemia or Death due to Dosing Errors with Vial Presentation: Can be life-threatening. Overdose has occurred as a result of dispensing, prescribing or administration errors. Attention to details at all levels is required to prevent these errors. (2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 5.1) Never share a HUMULIN R U-500 KwikPen or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. (5.2) Hyper- or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.3) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.4) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue HUMULIN R U-500, monitor, and treat if indicated. (5.5) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.6) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.7) 5.1 Hyperglycemia, Hypoglycemia or Death due to Dosing Errors with the Vial Presentation Medication errors associated with the HUMULIN R U-500 vial presentation have occurred and resulted in patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or death. The majority of errors occurred due to errors in dispensing, prescribing or administration. Attention to details at all levels may prevent these errors. Dispensing Errors Instruct patients to always inspect insulin vials to confirm that the correct insulin is dispensed including the correct insulin brand and concentration. The HUMULIN R U-500 vial, which contains 20 mL, has a band of diagonal brown stripes. “U-500” is also highlighted in red on the HUMULIN R U-500 vial label. Prescribing Errors When using a U-100 insulin syringe or tuberculin syringe, express the prescribed dose of HUMULIN R U-500 in units of insulin along with the appropriate corresponding markings on the syringe the patient is using [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Administration Errors Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. A majority of the medication errors with HUMULIN R U-500 vial presentation occurred due to dosing confusion when the HUMULIN R U-500 dose was prescribed in units or volume corresponding to a U-100 syringe or tuberculin syringe markings, respectively, or the prescribed dose was administered without recognizing that the markings on the syringe used do not directly correspond to U-500 dose. Adhere to administration and conversion instructions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]. Instruct the patient to inform hospital or emergency department staff of the dose of HUMULIN R U-500 prescribed, in the event of a future hospitalization or visit to the Emergency Department. Conversion instructions are provided and should always be used when administering HUMULIN R U-500 doses with U-100 insulin syringes or 1 mL tuberculin syringes [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.2 Never Share a HUMULIN R U-500 KwikPen or Syringe Between Patients HUMULIN R U-500 KwikPens should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMULIN R U-500 vials should never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment may be needed. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Severe hypoglycemia may develop as long as 18 to 24 hours after an injection of HUMULIN R U-500. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.4)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN R U-500 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia do not administer HUMULIN R U-500 intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump or dilute or mix HUMULIN R U-500 with any other insulin products or solutions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMULIN R U-500 [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN R U-500; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMULIN R U-500, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism, requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Lantus are: Hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection * 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 * Body System not Specified Table 2: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH,% (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection * 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 * Body System not Specified Table 3: Treatment –emergent adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Treatment –emergent adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) LANTUS, % (nj=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection* 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 * Body System not Specified Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 28 weeks with regular insulin Study B Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 28 weeks with regular insulin Study C Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 16 weeks with insulin lispro Study D Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 26 weeks with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 52 weeks oral agents Study F Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 28 weeks regular insulin Study G Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 5 years regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/totalN) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 7. Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference* , † (SE) 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5) 71/487 (14.6%) -2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% * Difference = Lantus - NPH † using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. Following are some of the examples: Drugs That May Increase the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG and Susceptibility to Hypoglycemia: Oral antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, pramlintide, disopyramide, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide). Drugs That May Reduce the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG: corticosteroids, isoniazid, niacin, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors, and thyroid hormones. Drugs That May Increase or Reduce the Blood-Glucose-Lowering Effect of HUMALOG: beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Drugs That May Reduce the Signs of Hypoglycemia: beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism and may necessitate insulin dose adjustment. (7) The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine). (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Adverse reactions associated with HUMALOG include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash.

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including HUMALOG, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including HUMALOG, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including HUMALOG, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) In a 12-week, randomized, crossover study in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (n=39), the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for HUMALOG and regular human insulin treated patients (see Table 3). Table 3: Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions HUMALOG (n=38) Regular human insulin (n=39) Catheter occlusions/month 0.09 0.10 Infusion site reactions 2.6% (1/38) 2.6% (1/39) In a randomized, 16-week, open-label, parallel design study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, adverse event reports related to infusion-site reactions were similar for insulin lispro and insulin aspart (21% of 100 patients versus 17% of 198 patients, respectively). In both groups, the most frequently reported infusion site adverse events were infusion site erythema and infusion site reaction. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy — As with any insulin therapy, patients taking HUMALOG may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection. These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of HUMALOG. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy — Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin, including HUMALOG. Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials, pruritus (with or without rash) was seen in 17 patients receiving regular human insulin (n=2969) and 30 patients receiving HUMALOG (n=2944). Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol, which is an excipient in HUMALOG [see Contraindications (4)]. Antibody Production In large clinical trials with patients with type 1 (n=509) and type 2 (n=262) diabetes mellitus, anti-insulin antibody (insulin lispro-specific antibodies, insulin-specific antibodies, cross-reactive antibodies) formation was evaluated in patients receiving both regular human insulin and HUMALOG (including patients previously treated with human insulin and naive patients). As expected, the largest increase in the antibody levels occurred in patients new to insulin therapy. The antibody levels peaked by 12 months and declined over the remaining years of the study These antibodies do not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate an increase in insulin dose. There was no statistically significant relationship between the change in the total daily insulin dose and the change in percent antibody binding for any of the antibody types. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMALOG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for HUMALOG have been identified during postapproval use [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Closely monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Change insulin regimens cautiously and only under medical supervision. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening. (5.2) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with any insulin, including HUMALOG. (5.3) Hypokalemia: All insulins, including HUMALOG can cause hypokalemia, which if untreated, may result in respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. (5.4) Renal or hepatic impairment: Like all insulins, may require a reduction in the HUMALOG dose. (5.5) Mixing: HUMALOG for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulins other than NPH insulin. Do not mix HUMALOG with any insulin for use in a continuous infusion pump. (5.6) Pump use: Select a new infusion site at least every 3 days and replace the HUMALOG in the pump reservoir at least every 7 days. (5.7) 5.1 Dose Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for HUMALOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, or local temperature. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect associated with insulins, including HUMALOG. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with tighter glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may be different for each person and may change from time to time. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures and may be life-threatening or cause death. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms similar to hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers [see Drug Interactions (7)], or intensified diabetes control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMALOG [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMALOG, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.5 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Mixing of Insulins HUMALOG for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin. If HUMALOG is mixed with NPH insulin, HUMALOG should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should occur immediately after mixing. Do not mix HUMALOG with other insulins for use in an external subcutaneous infusion pump. 5.7 Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pumps When used in an external insulin pump for subcutaneous infusion, HUMALOG should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin. Change the HUMALOG in the reservoir at least every 7 days, change the infusion sets and the infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. HUMALOG should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C). Malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with HUMALOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.8 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a HUMALOG KwikPen, cartridge, reusable pen compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges, or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. (5.1) Hyper- or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage, use of glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 7, 8.6, 8.7) Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. Do not transfer HUMALOG U-200 from the HUMALOG KwikPen to a syringe as overdosage and severe hypoglycemia can result. (5.4) Hypersensitivity Reactions: May be life-threatening. Discontinue HUMALOG, monitor and treat if indicated. (5.5) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.6) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.7) Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction: Monitor glucose and administer HUMALOG U-100 by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs. (5.8) 5.1 Never Share a HUMALOG KwikPen, Cartridge, Reusable Pen Compatible with Lilly 3 mL Cartridges1, or Syringe Between Patients HUMALOG KwikPens, cartridges, and reusable pens compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMALOG vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyper- or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including HUMALOG. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMALOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between HUMALOG and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. Do not transfer HUMALOG U-200 from the HUMALOG KwikPen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMALOG. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMALOG; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. HUMALOG is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMALOG or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMALOG, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMALOG, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered. 5.8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with HUMALOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.7)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that affect glucose metabolism: Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed; closely monitor blood glucose. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) Anti-Adrenergic Drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine): Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent (7.3, 7.4) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with TOUJEO use may be increased with antidiabetic agents, (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when TOUJEO is co-administered with these drugs. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of TOUJEO The glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO may be decreased when co-administered with atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isonazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline) and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when TOUJEO is co-administered with these drugs. 7.3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of TOUJEO The glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO may be increased or decreased when co-administered with alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and lithium salts. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when TOUJEO is co-administered with these drugs. 7.4 Drugs That May Affect Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are co-administered with TOUJEO."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypokalemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with TOUJEO (≥5%) are: Hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain. (6.1, 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi- aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 304 patients with type 1 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 23 weeks. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 46 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty five percent were male, 86% were Caucasian, 5 % were Black or African American and 5 % were Hispanic. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 82 mL/min/1.73m2 and 35% of patients had eGFR≥90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was 28 kg/m2. HbA1c at baseline was greater or equal to 8% in 58% of patients. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1242 patients with type 2 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 25 weeks. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 13 years. Fifty three percent were male, 88% were Caucasian, 7% were Black or African American and 17% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 79 mL/min/1.73m2 and 27% of patients had an eGFR≥90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was 35 kg/m2. HbA1c at baseline was greater or equal to 8% in 66% of patients. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in ≥5% of the population studied. Common adverse reactions occurring for TOUJEO-treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Hypoglycemia is discussed in a dedicated subsection below. Table 1: Adverse reactions in two pooled clinical trials of 26 weeks and 16 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (with incidence ≥5%) TOUJEO + mealtime insulin\"mealtime insulin\" refers to insulin glulisine, insulin lispro, or insulin aspart, % (n=304) Nasopharyngitis 12.8 Upper respiratory tract infection 9.5 Table 2: Adverse reactions in three pooled clinical trials of 26 weeks duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (with incidence ≥5%) TOUJEOone of the trials in type 2 diabetes included mealtime insulin, % (n=1,242) Nasopharyngitis 7.1 Upper respiratory tract infection 5.7 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including TOUJEO [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In the TOUJEO program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action and documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with typical symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value equal to or less than 54 mg/dL. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6.6% at 26 weeks. The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was 69% at 26 weeks. There were no clinically important differences in hypoglycemia between TOUJEO and LANTUS among type 1 diabetes patients. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes was 5% at 26 weeks in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen, and 1.0% and 0.9% respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received TOUJEO as part of a basal-insulin only regimen. The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving TOUJEO ranged from 8% to 37% at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen. Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including TOUJEO, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including TOUJEO, can cause lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including TOUJEO and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin therapy, including TOUJEO have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cardiovascular Safety No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO. The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN [Hazard Ratio (95% CI) for MACE; 1.02 (0.94, 1.11)]. In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) [Hazard Ratio (95% CI); 0.99 (0.88, 1.11)] or death from cancer [Hazard Ratio (95% CI); 0.94 (0.77, 1.15)] was also similar between treatment groups. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In a 6-month study of type 1 diabetes patients, 79% of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 62% that were positive at baseline and 44% of patients who developed anti-drug antibody [i.e., anti-insulin glargine antibody (ADA)] during the study. Eighty percent of the AIA positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline, remained AIA positive at month 6. In two 6-month studies in type 2 diabetes patients, 25% of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the study, including 42% who were positive at baseline and 20% of patients who developed ADA during the study. Ninety percent of the AIA positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline, remained AIA positive at month 6. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TOUJEO with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, may be misleading."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a TOUJEO SoloStar® disposable prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 6.1) Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. (5.4) Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue TOUJEO, monitor and treat if indicated (5.5, 6.1) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6). Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) 5.1 Never Share a TOUJEO SoloStar pen Between Patients TOUJEO SoloStar disposable prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral anti-diabetic products may be needed. On a unit to unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO according to labeling instructions, and adjust co-administered glucose lowering therapies per standard of care [See Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including TOUJEO. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [See Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of TOUJEO may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia do not administer TOUJEO intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump or dilute or mix TOUJEO with any other insulin products or solutions. 5.4 Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between TOUJEO and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including TOUJEO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue TOUJEO; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. TOUJEO is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or other of the excipients [See Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including TOUJEO, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including TOUJEO, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1, 5.2). •Insulin, particularly when given intravenously or in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.3). •Like all insulins, NovoLog requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.4, 5.5). •Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog (5.6). •Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including NovoLog (5.10). 5.1 Administration NovoLog has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin. An injection of NovoLog should immediately be followed by a meal within 5-10 minutes. Because of NovoLog’s short duration of action, a longer acting insulin should also be used in patients with type 1 diabetes and may also be needed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes and is particularly important for patients using external pump infusion therapy. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of NovoLog action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness, emotional disturbances, or other stresses. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure. Needles and NovoLog FlexPen must not be shared. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including NovoLog. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring more close monitoring for hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations, and patients receiving intravenously administered insulin). 5.4 Renal Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Hepatic Impairment As with other insulins, the dose requirements for NovoLog may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions - As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of NovoLog injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol, which is an excipient in NovoLog. Systemic Reactions - Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin product, including NovoLog. Anaphylactic reactions with NovoLog have been reported post-approval. Generalized allergy to insulin may also cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials, allergic reactions were reported in 3 of 735 patients (0.4%) treated with regular human insulin and 10 of 1394 patients (0.7%) treated with NovoLog. In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 3 of 2341 (0.1%) NovoLog-treated patients discontinued due to allergic reactions. 5.7 Antibody Production Increases in anti-insulin antibody titers that react with both human insulin and insulin aspart have been observed in patients treated with NovoLog. Increases in anti-insulin antibodies are observed more frequently with NovoLog than with regular human insulin. Data from a 12-month controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes suggest that the increase in these antibodies is transient, and the differences in antibody levels between the regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups observed at 3 and 6 months were no longer evident at 12 months. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known. These antibodies do not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 5.8 Mixing of Insulins •Mixing NovoLog with NPH human insulin immediately before injection attenuates the peak concentration of NovoLog, without significantly affecting the time to peak concentration or total bioavailability of NovoLog. If NovoLog is mixed with NPH human insulin, NovoLog should be drawn into the syringe first, and the mixture should be injected immediately after mixing. •The efficacy and safety of mixing NovoLog with insulin preparations produced by other manufacturers have not been studied. •Insulin mixtures should not be administered intravenously. 5.9 Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion by External Pump When used in an external subcutaneous insulin infusion pump, NovoLog should not be mixed with any other insulin or diluent. When using NovoLog in an external insulin pump, the NovoLog-specific information should be followed (e.g., in-use time, frequency of changing infusion sets) because NovoLog-specific information may differ from general pump manual instructions. Pump or infusion set malfunctions or insulin degradation can lead to a rapid onset of hyperglycemia and ketosis because of the small subcutaneous depot of insulin. This is especially pertinent for rapid-acting insulin analogs that are more rapidly absorbed through skin and have a shorter duration of action. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy with subcutaneous injection may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. NovoLog should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 37°C (98.6°F). NovoLog that will be used in a pump should not be mixed with other insulin or with a diluent [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.10 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NovoLog, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Adverse reactions associated with HUMALOG include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared with those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events during HUMALOG clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (adverse events with frequency ≥5%) Events, n (%) Lispro (n=81) Regular human insulin (n=86) Total (n=167) Flu syndrome 28 (34.6) 28 (32.6) 56 (33.5) Pharyngitis 27 (33.3) 29 (33.7) 56 (33.5) Rhinitis 20 (24.7) 25 (29.1) 45 (26.9) Headache 24 (29.6) 19 (22.1) 43 (25.7) Pain 16 (19.8) 14 (16.3) 30 (18.0) Cough increased 14 (17.3) 15 (17.4) 29 (17.4) Infection 11 (13.6) 18 (20.9) 29 (17.4) Nausea 5 (6.2) 13 (15.1) 18 (10.8) Accidental injury 7 (8.6) 10 (11.6) 17 (10.2) Surgical procedure 5 (6.2) 12 (14.0) 17 (10.2) Fever 5 (6.2) 10 (11.6) 15 (9.0) Abdominal pain 6 (7.4) 7 (8.1) 13 (7.8) Asthenia 6 (7.4) 7 (8.1) 13 (7.8) Bronchitis 6 (7.4) 6 (7.0) 12 (7.2) Diarrhea 7 (8.6) 5 (5.8) 12 (7.2) Dysmenorrhea 5 (6.2) 6 (7.0) 11 (6.6) Myalgia 6 (7.4) 5 (5.8) 11 (6.6) Urinary tract infection 5 (6.2) 4 (4.7) 9 (5.4) Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (adverse events with frequency ≥5%) Events, n (%) Lispro (n=714) Regular human insulin (n=709) Total (n=1423) Headache 63 (11.6) 66 (9.3) 149 (10.5) Pain 77 (10.8) 71 (10.0) 148 (10.4) Infection 72 (10.1) 54 (7.6) 126 (8.9) Pharyngitis 47 (6.6) 58 (8.2) 105 (7.4) Rhinitis 58 (8.1) 47 (6.6) 105 (7.4) Flu syndrome 44 (6.2) 58 (8.2) 102 (7.2) Surgical procedure 53 (7.4) 48 (6.8) 101 (7.1) Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including HUMALOG, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including HUMALOG, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including HUMALOG, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) In a 12-week, randomized, crossover study in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (n=39), the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for HUMALOG and regular human insulin treated patients (see Table 3). Table 3: Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions HUMALOG (n=38) Regular human insulin (n=39) Catheter occlusions/month 0.09 0.10 Infusion site reactions 2.6% (1/38) 2.6% (1/39) In a randomized, 16-week, open-label, parallel design study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, adverse event reports related to infusion-site reactions were similar for insulin lispro and insulin aspart (21% of 100 patients versus 17% of 198 patients, respectively). In both groups, the most frequently reported infusion site adverse events were infusion site erythema and infusion site reaction. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy — As with any insulin therapy, patients taking HUMALOG may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection. These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of HUMALOG. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy — Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin, including HUMALOG. Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials, pruritus (with or without rash) was seen in 17 patients receiving regular human insulin (n=2969) and 30 patients receiving HUMALOG (n=2944). Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol, which is an excipient in HUMALOG [see Contraindications (4)]. Antibody Production In large clinical trials with patients with type 1 (n=509) and type 2 (n=262) diabetes mellitus, anti-insulin antibody (insulin lispro-specific antibodies, insulin-specific antibodies, cross-reactive antibodies) formation was evaluated in patients receiving both regular human insulin and HUMALOG (including patients previously treated with human insulin and naive patients). As expected, the largest increase in the antibody levels occurred in patients new to insulin therapy. The antibody levels peaked by 12 months and declined over the remaining years of the study These antibodies do not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate an increase in insulin dose. There was no statistically significant relationship between the change in the total daily insulin dose and the change in percent antibody binding for any of the antibody types. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMALOG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for HUMALOG have been identified during postapproval use [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Closely monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Change insulin regimens cautiously and only under medical supervision. (5.1) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening. (5.2) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with any insulin, including HUMALOG. (5.3) Hypokalemia: All insulins, including HUMALOG can cause hypokalemia, which if untreated, may result in respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. (5.4) Renal or hepatic impairment: Like all insulins, may require a reduction in the HUMALOG dose. (5.5) Mixing: HUMALOG for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulins other than NPH insulin. Do not mix HUMALOG with any insulin for use in a continuous infusion pump. (5.6) Pump use: Select a new infusion site at least every 3 days and replace the HUMALOG in the pump reservoir at least every 7 days. (5.7) 5.1 Dose Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for HUMALOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, or local temperature. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect associated with insulins, including HUMALOG. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with tighter glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may be different for each person and may change from time to time. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures and may be life-threatening or cause death. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms similar to hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers [see Drug Interactions (7)], or intensified diabetes control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMALOG [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMALOG, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.5 Renal or Hepatic Impairment Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Mixing of Insulins HUMALOG for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin. If HUMALOG is mixed with NPH insulin, HUMALOG should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should occur immediately after mixing. Do not mix HUMALOG with other insulins for use in an external subcutaneous infusion pump. 5.7 Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pumps When used in an external insulin pump for subcutaneous infusion, HUMALOG should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin. Change the HUMALOG in the reservoir at least every 7 days, change the infusion sets and the infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. HUMALOG should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C). Malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with HUMALOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16), and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.8 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of medications that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or decrease the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. •Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose (7) •The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) (7)"

The frequencies of adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) reported during LEVEMIR clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Tables 1-4 below. See Tables 5 and 6 for the hypoglycemia findings. In the LEVEMIR add-on to liraglutide+metformin trial, all patients received liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin during a 12-week run-in period. During the run-in period, 167 patients (17% of enrolled total) withdrew from the trial: 76 (46% of withdrawals) of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions and 15 (9% of withdrawals) doing so due to other adverse events. Only those patients who completed the run-in period with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to 26 weeks of add-on therapy with LEVEMIR or continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin. During this randomized 26-week period, diarrhea was the only adverse reaction reported in ≥5% of patients treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (11.7%) and greater than in patients treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin alone (6.9%). In two pooled trials, a total of 1155 adults with type 1 diabetes were exposed to individualized doses of LEVEMIR (n=767) or NPH (n=388). The mean duration of exposure to LEVEMIR was 153 days, and the total exposure to LEVEMIR was 321 patient-years. The most common adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1.

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] • Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LEVEMIR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials. For the adult trials and one of the pediatric trials (Study D), severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person and associated with either a plasma glucose value below 56 mg/dL (blood glucose below 50 mg/dL) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. For the other pediatric trial (Study I), severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semi-consciousness, unconsciousness, coma and/or convulsions in a patient who could not assist in the treatment and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose. For the adult trials and pediatric Study D, non-severe hypoglycemia was defined as an asymptomatic or symptomatic plasma glucose < 56 mg/dL (or equivalently blood glucose <50 mg/dL as used in Study A and C) that was self-treated by the patient. For pediatric Study I, non-severe hypoglycemia included asymptomatic events with plasma glucose <65 mg/dL as well as symptomatic events that the patient could self-treat or treat by taking oral therapy provided by the caregiver. The rates of hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable between LEVEMIR-treated patients and non-LEVEMIR-treated patients (see Tables 5 and 6).

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. • Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LEVEMIR, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . • Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria [see Clinical Studies (14)]. • Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LEVEMIR, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. • Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LEVEMIR may experience injection site reactions, including localized erythema, pain, pruritus, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adults, three patients treated with LEVEMIR reported injection site pain (0.25%) compared to one patient treated with NPH insulin (0.12%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LEVEMIR, and may be life-threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . • Antibody Production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. These insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LEVEMIR, antibody development has been observed with no apparent impact on glycemic control. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LEVEMIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported during post-approval use of LEVEMIR in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting or short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LEVEMIR [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LEVEMIR and other insulins, patients should be instructed always to verify the insulin label before each injection."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Never Share a LEVEMIR FlexTouch between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). •Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2) •Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump, intramuscularly, or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.3) •Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.4, 6.1) •Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.5) •Renal or hepatic impairment: May require adjustment of the LEVEMIR dose (5.6, 5.7) •Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including LEVEMIR (5.9) 5.1 Never Share a LEVEMIR FlexTouch Between Patients LEVEMIR FlexTouch must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in the insulin dose or an adjustment of concomitant anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LEVEMIR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.3 Administration LEVEMIR should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer LEVEMIR intravenously or intramuscularly. The intended duration of activity of LEVEMIR is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Do not use LEVEMIR in insulin infusion pumps. Do not dilute or mix LEVEMIR with any other insulin or solution. If LEVEMIR is diluted or mixed, the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LEVEMIR and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. When a GLP-1 receptor agonist is used in combination with LEVEMIR, the LEVEMIR dose may need to be lowered or more conservatively titrated to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. All patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion, or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LEVEMIR. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LEVEMIR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LEVEMIR. 5.6 Renal Impairment No difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of insulin detemir between non-diabetic individuals with renal impairment and healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with renal impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Non-diabetic individuals with severe hepatic impairment had lower systemic exposures to insulin detemir compared to healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with liver impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.8 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.9 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LEVEMIR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

(7.1, 7.2, 7.3) Anti-Adrenergic Drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine): Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. (5.3, 7.4) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with HUMULIN 70/30 use may be increased when co-administered with antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, disopyramide, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide). Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN 70/30 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN 70/30 The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN 70/30 may be decreased when co-administered with corticosteroids, isoniazid, niacin, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors, and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN 70/30 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN 70/30 The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN 70/30 may be increased or decreased when co-administered with beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN 70/30 is co-administered with these drugs. 7.4 Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are co-administered with HUMULIN 70/30."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMULIN 70/30. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, weight gain, and edema. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking HUMULIN 70/30 have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Peripheral Edema Some patients taking HUMULIN 70/30 have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including HUMULIN 70/30, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] in some patients. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including HUMULIN 70/30 and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Immunogenicity Development of antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed with all insulin, including HUMULIN 70/30."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a HUMULIN 70/30 pen, HUMULIN 70/30 KwikPen, or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. (5.1) Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage, use of glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 7, 8.6, 8.7) Hypersensitivity Reactions: May be life-threatening. Discontinue HUMULIN 70/30, monitor and treat if indicated. (5.4) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.5) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.6) 5.1 Never Share a HUMULIN 70/30 Pen, HUMULIN 70/30 KwikPen, or Syringe Between Patients HUMULIN 70/30 pens and HUMULIN 70/30 KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMULIN 70/30 vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including HUMULIN 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN 70/30 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMULIN 70/30. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN 70/30; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. HUMULIN 70/30 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMULIN 70/30 or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMULIN 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.6 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN 70/30, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypokalemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with APIDRA include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during APIDRA clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled studies of adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) APIDRA, % (n=950) All comparatorsInsulin lispro, regular human insulin, insulin aspart, % (n=641) Nasopharyngitis 10.6 12.9 HypoglycemiaOnly severe symptomatic hypoglycemia 6.8 6.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 6.6 5.6 Influenza 4.0 5.0 Table 2: Treatment –emergent adverse events in pooled studies of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency ≥ 5%) APIDRA, % (n=883) Regular human insulin, % (n=883) Upper respiratory tract infection 10.5 7.7 Nasopharyngitis 7.6 8.2 Edema peripheral 7.5 7.8 Influenza 6.2 4.2 Arthralgia 5.9 6.3 Hypertension 3.9 5.3 Pediatrics Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions occurring with frequency higher than 5% in a clinical study in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes treated with APIDRA (n=277) or insulin lispro (n=295).

The rates and incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia requiring intervention from a third party, were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Table 4). In the phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to adults with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 4) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 4: Severe Symptomatic HypoglycemiaSevere symptomatic hypoglycemia defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring the assistance of another person that met one of the following criteria: the event was associated with a whole blood referenced blood glucose <36mg/dL or the event was associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration.

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including APIDRA, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including APIDRA, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including APIDRA, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) In a 12-week randomized study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n=59), the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for APIDRA and insulin aspart treated patients (Table 5). Table 5: Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions. APIDRA (n=29) insulin aspart (n=30) Catheter occlusions/month 0.08 0.15 Infusion site reactions 10.3% (3/29) 13.3% (4/30) Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking APIDRA may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection. These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions may require discontinuation of APIDRA. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin, including APIDRA. Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials up to 12 months duration, potential systemic allergic reactions were reported in 79 of 1833 patients (4.3%) who received APIDRA and 58 of 1524 patients (3.8%) who received the comparator short-acting insulins. During these trials treatment with APIDRA was permanently discontinued in 1 of 1833 patients due to a potential systemic allergic reaction. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of metacresol, which is an excipient of APIDRA. Antibody Production In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n=333), the concentrations of insulin antibodies that react with both human insulin and insulin glulisine (cross-reactive insulin antibodies) remained near baseline during the first 6 months of the study in the patients treated with APIDRA. A decrease in antibody concentration was observed during the following 6 months of the study. In a study in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=411), a similar increase in cross-reactive insulin antibody concentration was observed in the patients treated with APIDRA and in the patients treated with human insulin during the first 9 months of the study. Thereafter the concentration of antibodies decreased in the APIDRA patients and remained stable in the human insulin patients. There was no correlation between cross-reactive insulin antibody concentration and changes in HbA1c, insulin doses, or incidence of hypoglycemia. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known. APIDRA did not elicit a significant antibody response in a study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of APIDRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly long-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of APIDRA [See Patient Counseling Information (17)] ."

Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for APIDRA may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, or local temperature. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including APIDRA. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with tighter glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with APIDRA. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms similar to hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers [See Drug Interactions (7)], or intensified diabetes control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring closer monitoring for hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including APIDRA [See Adverse reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including APIDRA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). Monitor glucose and potassium frequently when APIDRA is administered intravenously. 5.6 Renal or hepatic impairment Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. 5.7 Mixing of insulins APIDRA for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin. If APIDRA is mixed with NPH insulin, APIDRA should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should occur immediately after mixing. Do not mix APIDRA with other insulins for intravenous administration or for use in a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump. APIDRA for intravenous administration should not be diluted with solutions other than 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). The efficacy and safety of mixing APIDRA with diluents or other insulins for use in external subcutaneous infusion pumps have not been established. 5.8 Subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps When used in an external insulin pump for subcutaneous infusion, APIDRA should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin. APIDRA in the reservoir must be changed at least every 48 hours. APIDRA should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C). Malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or handling errors or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia, ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with APIDRA may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available. [See Dosage and Administration (2.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.9 Intravenous administration When APIDRA is administered intravenously, glucose and potassium levels must be closely monitored to avoid potentially fatal hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Do not mix APIDRA with other insulins for intravenous administration. APIDRA may be diluted only in normal saline solution. 5.10 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.11 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including APIDRA and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of medications that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or decrease the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose (7) The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine).

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions associated with LEVEMIR include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) reported during LEVEMIR clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Tables 1-4 below. See Tables 5 and 6 for the hypoglycemia findings. Table 1: Adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) in two pooled clinical trials of 16 weeks and 24 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse reactions with incidence ≥ 5%) LEVEMIR, % (n = 767) NPH, % (n = 388) Upper respiratory tract infection 26.1 21.4 Headache 22.6 22.7 Pharyngitis 9.5 8.0 Influenza-like illness 7.8 7.0 Abdominal Pain 6.0 2.6 Table 2: Adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) in a 26-week trial comparing insulin aspart + LEVEMIR to insulin aspart + insulin glargine in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse reactions with incidence ≥ 5%) LEVEMIR, % (n = 161) Glargine, % (n = 159) Upper respiratory tract infection 26.7 32.1 Headache 14.3 19.5 Back pain 8.1 6.3 Influenza-like illness 6.2 8.2 Gastroenteritis 5.6 4.4 Bronchitis 5.0 1.9 Table 3: Adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) in two pooled clinical trials of 22 weeks and 24 weeks duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse reactions with incidence ≥ 5%) LEVEMIR, % (n = 432) NPH, % (n = 437) Upper respiratory tract infection 12.5 11.2 Headache 6.5 5.3 Table 4: Adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) in a 26-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse reactions with incidence ≥ 5%) LEVEMIR, % (n = 232) NPH, % (n = 115) Upper respiratory tract infection 35.8 42.6 Headache 31.0 32.2 Pharyngitis 17.2 20.9 Gastroenteritis 16.8 11.3 Influenza-like illness 13.8 20.9 Abdominal pain 13.4 13.0 Pyrexia 10.3 6.1 Cough 8.2 4.3 Viral infection 7.3 7.8 Nausea 6.5 7.0 Rhinitis 6.5 3.5 Vomiting 6.5 10.4 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LEVEMIR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Non-severe hypoglycemia was defined as an asymptomatic or symptomatic plasma glucose < 56 mg/dL (<50 mg/dL in Study A and C) that was self-treated by the patient. The rates of hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable between LEVEMIR-treated patients and non-LEVEMIR-treated patients (see Tables 5 and 6).

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LEVEMIR, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin adsorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LEVEMIR, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LEVEMIR may experience injection site reactions, including localized erythema, pain, pruritis, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adults, three patients treated with LEVEMIR reported injection site pain (0.25%) compared to one patient treated with NPH insulin (0.12%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LEVEMIR, and may be life-threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Antibody Production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. These insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LEVEMIR, antibody development has been observed with no apparent impact on glycemic control. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LEVEMIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported during post-approval use of LEVEMIR in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting or short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LEVEMIR [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LEVEMIR and other insulins, patients should be instructed always to verify the insulin label before each injection."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump, intramuscularly, or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. (5.4) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require adjustment of the LEVEMIR dose (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in the insulin dose or an adjustment of concomitant anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LEVEMIR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration LEVEMIR should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer LEVEMIR intravenously or intramuscularly. The intended duration of activity of LEVEMIR is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Do not use LEVEMIR in insulin infusion pumps. Do not dilute or mix LEVEMIR with any other insulin or solution. If LEVEMIR is diluted or mixed, the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LEVEMIR and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion, or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LEVEMIR. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LEVEMIR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient’s awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LEVEMIR. 5.5 Renal Impairment No difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of insulin detemir between non-diabetic individuals with renal impairment and healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with renal impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Non-diabetic individuals with severe hepatic impairment had lower systemic exposures to insulin detemir compared to healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with liver impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] ."

Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (≤56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)].

The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome.

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that Affect Glucose Metabolism: Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3) Anti-Adrenergic Drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine): Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent. (5.3, 7.4) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with HUMULIN N use may be increased when co-administered with antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfonamide antibiotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, fluoxetine, disopyramide, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, and somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide). Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN N is co-administered with these drugs. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN N The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN N may be decreased when co-administered with corticosteroids, isoniazid, niacin, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), somatropin, atypical antipsychotics, glucagon, protease inhibitors, and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN N is co-administered with these drugs. 7.3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN N The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN N may be increased or decreased when co-administered with beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN N is co-administered with these drugs. 7.4 Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are co-administered with HUMULIN N."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMULIN N. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions observed with HUMULIN N include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, weight gain, and edema. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking HUMULIN N have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Peripheral Edema Some patients taking HUMULIN N have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including HUMULIN N, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] in some patients. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including HUMULIN N and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Immunogenicity Development of antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed with all insulin, including HUMULIN N."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a HUMULIN N pen, HUMULIN N KwikPen, or syringe between patients, even if the needle is changed. (5.1) Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage, use of glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 7, 8.6, 8.7) Hypersensitivity Reactions: May be life-threatening. Discontinue HUMULIN N, monitor and treat if indicated. (5.4) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. (5.5) Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. (5.6) 5.1 Never Share a HUMULIN N Pen, HUMULIN N KwikPen, or Syringe Between Patients HUMULIN N pens and HUMULIN N KwikPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMULIN N vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including HUMULIN N. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN N may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMULIN N. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN N; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. HUMULIN N is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMULIN N or any of its excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including HUMULIN N, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.6 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN N, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."
