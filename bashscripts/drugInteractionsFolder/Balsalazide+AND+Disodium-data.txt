Adult Ulcerative Colitis During clinical development, 259 adult patients with active ulcerative colitis were exposed to 6.75 g/day COLAZAL in 4 controlled trials. In the 4 controlled clinical trials patients receiving a COLAZAL dose of 6.75 g/day most frequently reported the following adverse reactions: headache (8%), abdominal pain (6%), diarrhea (5%), nausea (5%), vomiting (4%), respiratory infection (4%), and arthralgia (4%). Withdrawal from therapy due to adverse reactions was comparable among patients on COLAZAL and placebo. Adverse reactions reported by 1% or more of patients who participated in the 4 well-controlled, Phase 3 trials are presented by treatment group (Table 1). The number of placebo patients (35), however, is too small for valid comparisons. Some adverse reactions, such as abdominal pain, fatigue, and nausea were reported more frequently in women than in men. Abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and anemia can be part of the clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis.

The data described below reflect exposure of balsalazide disodium in 565 ulcerative colitis patients with mildly to moderately active disease. Balsalazide disodium was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial (168 treated with balsalazide disodium), one active-controlled trial (210 treated with balsalazide disodium); and a subset of these patients also participated in an uncontrolled, open-label, extension study (additional 187 treated with balsalazide disodium). The population studied had a mean age of 43.1 (range: 18 to 80) years; approximately 94% of patients were < 65 years old, 49% were male, and 84% were white. In the placebo-controlled trial, the most common adverse reactions with balsalazide disodium in male patients were headache, nasopharyngitis, anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, pharyngolaryngeal pain, and urinary tract infection. 10% of patients in the balsalazide disodium group and 13% of patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The most common serious adverse reactions in both the placebo and balsalazide disodium groups were gastrointestinal disorders, which were mainly associated with symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of male patients and at a rate numerically higher than placebo in the placebo-controlled trial are listed in Table 1.

The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported by less than 1% of balsalazide disodium-treated ulcerative colitis patients in controlled trials. Cardiovascular and Vascular: increased blood pressure, increased heart rate Dermatological: erythema nodosum, rash Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, constipation, defecation urgency, diarrhea, dry mouth, hard feces, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting Hepatobiliary Disorders: increased aspartate aminotransferase Infections and Infestations: gastroenteritis, upper respiratory infection Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia, back pain, myalgia Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, lethargy General Disorders and Administrative Site Disorders: face edema, fatigue, malaise, pain, pyrexia, swelling 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis was reported. Observe patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. (5.1) Renal impairment may occur. Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. (5.2) Use with caution with pre-existing liver disease. (5.3) 5.1 Exacerbations of Ulcerative Colitis Balsalazide is converted to mesalamine, which has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. In controlled clinical trials with balsalazide disodium in adults with ulcerative colitis, 7% of male patients reported exacerbation of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Observe patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with balsalazide disodium. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products that release mesalamine in the gastrointestinal tract. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of balsalazide disodium tablets therapy and periodically while on therapy. Exercise caution when using balsalazide disodium tablets in patients with known renal dysfunction or a history of renal disease. 5.3 Use in Hepatic Impairment There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Because balsalazide is converted to mesalamine, use caution and consider liver function testing when administering balsalazide disodium to patients with liver disease."

Adult Ulcerative Colitis During clinical development, 259 adult patients with active ulcerative colitis were exposed to 6.75 g/day balsalazide in 4 controlled trials. In the 4 controlled clinical trials patients receiving a balsalazide dose of 6.75 g/day most frequently reported the following adverse reactions: headache (8%), abdominal pain (6%), diarrhea (5%), nausea (5%), vomiting (4%), respiratory infection (4%), and arthralgia (4%). Withdrawal from therapy due to adverse reactions was comparable among patients on balsalazide and placebo. Adverse reactions reported by 1% or more of patients who participated in the 4 well-controlled, Phase 3 trials are presented by treatment group (Table 1). The number of placebo patients (35), however, is too small for valid comparisons. Some adverse reactions, such as abdominal pain, fatigue, and nausea were reported more frequently in women than in men. Abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and anemia can be part of the clinical presentation of ulcerative colitis.

The data described below reflect exposure of GIAZO in 565 ulcerative colitis patients with mildly to moderately active disease. GIAZO was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial (168 treated with GIAZO), one active-controlled trial (210 treated with GIAZO); and a subset of these patients also participated in an uncontrolled, open-label, extension study (additional 187 treated with GIAZO). The population studied had a mean age of 43.1 (range: 18-80) years; approximately 94% of patients were < 65 years old, 49% were male, and 84% were white. In the placebo-controlled trial, the most common adverse reactions with GIAZO in male patients were headache, nasopharyngitis, anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, pharyngolaryngeal pain, and urinary tract infection. 10% of patients in the GIAZO group and 13% of patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The most common serious adverse reactions in both the placebo and GIAZO groups were gastrointestinal disorders, which were mainly associated with symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of male patients and at a rate numerically higher than placebo in the placebo-controlled trial are listed in Table 1.

The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported by less than 1% of GIAZO-treated ulcerative colitis patients in controlled trials. Cardiovascular and Vascular: increased blood pressure, increased heart rate Dermatological: erythema nodosum, rash Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, constipation, defecation urgency, diarrhea, dry mouth, hard feces, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting Hepatobiliary Disorders: increased aspartate aminotransferase Infections and Infestations: gastroenteritis, upper respiratory infection Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia, back pain, myalgia Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, lethargy General Disorders and Administrative Site Disorders: face edema, fatigue, malaise, pain, pyrexia, swelling 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Exacerbation of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis was reported. Observe patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. (5.1) •Renal impairment may occur. Assess renal function at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. (5.2) Use with caution with pre-existing liver disease. (5.3) 5.1 Exacerbations of Ulcerative Colitis Balsalazide is converted to mesalamine, which has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. In controlled clinical trials with GIAZO in adults with ulcerative colitis, 7% of male patients reported exacerbation of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Observe patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with GIAZO. 5.2 Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis and renal failure, has been reported in patients given products that release mesalamine in the gastrointestinal tract. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of GIAZO therapy and periodically while on therapy. Exercise caution when using GIAZO in patients with known renal dysfunction or a history of renal disease. 5.3 Use in Hepatic Impairment There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Because balsalazide is converted to mesalamine, use caution and consider liver function testing when administering GIAZO to patients with liver disease."
