        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Other PDE 3 inhibitors: Exacerbation of inotropic effects (7.2) • Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use (7.3) 7.1 Drugs that Prolong QT Do not use anagrelide in patients taking medications that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide and pimozide) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 PDE3 Inhibitors Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. The effects of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.3 Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk Co-administration of single-dose or repeat-dose anagrelide and aspirin showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Results from an observational study in patients with essential thrombocythemia suggest the rate of major hemorrhagic events (MHEs) in patients treated with anagrelide is higher than in those subjects treated with another cytoreductive treatment. The majority of the major hemorrhagic events occurred in patients who were also receiving concomitant anti-aggregatory treatment (primarily, aspirin). Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). 7.4 CYP450 Interactions CYP1A2 inhibitors: Anagrelide and its active metabolite are primarily metabolized by CYP1A2. Drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) could increase the exposure of anagrelide. Monitor patients for cardiovascular events and titrate doses accordingly when CYP1A2 inhibitors are co-administered. CYP1A2 inducers: CYP1A2 inducers could decrease the exposure of anagrelide. Patients taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., omeprazole) may need to have their dose titrated to compensate for the decrease in anagrelide exposure. CYP1A2 substrates: Anagrelide demonstrates limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 in vitro and may alter the exposure of concomitant CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline, fluvoxamine, ondansetron)."

Clinical Studies in Adult Patients In three single-arm clinical studies, 942 patients [see Clinical Trials (14)] diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms of varying etiology (ET: 551; PV: 117; OMPN: 274) were exposed to anagrelide with a mean duration of approximately 65 weeks. Serious adverse reactions reported in these patients included the following: congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, pericardial effusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and pancreatitis. Of the 942 patients treated with anagrelide, 161 (17%) were discontinued from the study because of adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results. The most common adverse reactions for treatment discontinuation were headache, diarrhea, edema, palpitations, and abdominal pain. The most frequently reported adverse reactions to anagrelide (in 5% or greater of 942 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms) in clinical trials were listed in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Studies in at least 5% of Patients Adverse reactions Anagrelide (N=942) (%) Cardiac disorders Palpitations 26% Tachycardia 8% Chest pain 8% General disorders and administration site conditions Asthenia 23% Edema 21% Pain 15% Fever 9% Peripheral edema 9% Malaise 6% Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea 26% Nausea 17% Abdominal pain 16% Vomiting 10% Flatulence 10% Anorexia 8% Dyspepsia 5% Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 12% Cough 6% Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 8% Pruritus 6% Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 6% Nervous system disorders Headache 44% Dizziness 15% Paresthesia 6% Adverse Reactions (frequency 1% to < 5%) included: General disorders and administration site conditions: Flu symptoms, chills. Cardiac disorders: Arrhythmia, angina pectoris, heart failure, syncope. Vascular disorders: Hemorrhage, hypertension, postural hypotension, vasodilatation. Gastrointestinal disorders: Constipation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastritis. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, ecchymosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Elevated liver enzymes. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia, myalgia. Psychiatric disorders: Depression, confusion, nervousness. Nervous system disorders: Somnolence, insomnia, amnesia, migraine headache. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Epistaxis, pneumonia. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia. Eye disorders: Abnormal vision, diplopia. Ear and labyrinth disorders: Tinnitus Renal and urinary disorders: Hematuria, renal failure. Other less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) were: Cardiac disorders: Ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous system disorders: Hypoesthesia. Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients The frequency of adverse events observed in pediatric patients was similar to adult patients. The most common adverse events observed in pediatric patients were fever, epistaxis, headache, and fatigue during the 3-month anagrelide treatment in the study. Episodes of increased pulse and decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressure beyond the normal ranges in the absence of clinical symptoms were observed. Adverse events that had been reported in these pediatric patients prior to the study and were considered to be related to anagrelide treatment based on retrospective review were; palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, fatigue, and muscle cramps. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of anagrelide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of torsades de pointes, interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5)], tubulointerstitial nephritis and clinically significant hepatotoxicity (including symptomatic ALT and AST elevations and elevations greater than three times the ULN) have been reported. Other adverse events in pediatric patients reported in spontaneous reports and literature reviews include anemia, cutaneous photosensitivity and elevated leukocyte count."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Cardiovascular Toxicity: QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. Monitor patients for cardiovascular effects. (5.1) •Bleeding Risk: Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (5.2) 5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary. Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 )] . In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks. 5.2 Bleeding Risk Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis) have been reported to be associated with the use of anagrelide in post-marketing reports. Most cases presented with progressive dyspnea with lung infiltrations. The time of onset ranged from 1 week to several years after initiating anagrelide. If suspected, discontinue anagrelide and evaluate. Symptoms may improve after discontinuation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."

        "Drug Interactions Limited PK and/or PD studies investigating possible interactions between anagrelide and other medicinal products have been conducted. In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that digoxin and warfarin do not affect the PK properties of anagrelide, nor does anagrelide affect the PK properties of digoxin or warfarin. In two clinical interaction studies in healthy subjects, coadministration of single-dose anagrelide 1 mg and aspirin 900 mg or repeat-dose anagrelide 1 mg once daily and aspirin 75 mg once daily showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone. Coadministered anagrelide 1 mg and aspirin 900 mg single-doses had no effect on bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The potential risks and benefits of concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is commenced. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with the other common medications used concomitantly with anagrelide in clinical trials which were acetaminophen, furosemide, iron, ranitidine, hydroxyurea, and allopurinol. Anagrelide is metabolized at least in part by CYP1A2. It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including fluvoxamine, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide. Anagrelide demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g., theophylline. Anagrelide is an inhibitor of cyclic AMP PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by anagrelide. There is a single case report which suggests that sucralfate may interfere with anagrelide absorption. Food has no clinically significant effect on the bioavailability of anagrelide."

Eye disorders: Abnormal vision, diplopia. Ear and labyrinth disorders: Tinnitus Renal and urinary disorders: Hematuria, renal failure. Other less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) were: Cardiac disorders: Ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous system disorders: Hypoesthesia. Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients The frequency of adverse events observed in pediatric patients was similar to adult patients. The most common adverse events observed in pediatric patients were fever, epistaxis, headache, and fatigue during the 3-month anagrelide treatment in the study. Episodes of increased pulse and decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressure beyond the normal ranges in the absence of clinical symptoms were observed. Adverse events that had been reported in these pediatric patients prior to the study and were considered to be related to anagrelide treatment based on retrospective review were; palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, fatigue, and muscle cramps. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of anagrelide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of torsades de pointes, interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5)], tubulointerstitial nephritis and clinically significant hepatotoxicity (including symptomatic ALT and AST elevations and elevations greater than three times the ULN) have been reported. Other adverse events in pediatric patients reported in spontaneous reports and literature reviews include anemia, cutaneous photosensitivity and elevated leukocyte count."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Cardiovascular Toxicity: QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. Monitor patients for cardiovascular effects. (5.1) •Bleeding Risk: Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (5.2) 5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary. Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 , 12.3 )] . In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks. 5.2 Bleeding Risk Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis) have been reported to be associated with the use of anagrelide in post-marketing reports. Most cases presented with progressive dyspnea with lung infiltrations. The time of onset ranged from 1 week to several years after initiating anagrelide. If suspected, discontinue anagrelide and evaluate. Symptoms may improve after discontinuation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other PDE 3 inhibitors: Exacerbation of inotropic effects (7.2) Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use (7.3) 7.1 Drugs that Prolong QT Do not use AGRYLIN in patients taking medications that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide and pimozide) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.2 PDE3 Inhibitors Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. The effects of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 7.3 Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk Co-administration of single-dose or repeat-dose anagrelide and aspirin showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Results from an observational study in patients with essential thrombocythemia suggest the rate of major hemorrhagic events (MHEs) in patients treated with anagrelide is higher than in those subjects treated with another cytoreductive treatment. The majority of the major hemorrhagic events occurred in patients who were also receiving concomitant anti-aggregatory treatment (primarily, aspirin). Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). 7.4 CYP450 Interactions CYP1A2 inhibitors: Anagrelide and its active metabolite are primarily metabolized by CYP1A2. Drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) could increase the exposure of anagrelide. Monitor patients for cardiovascular events and titrate doses accordingly when CYP1A2 inhibitors are co-administered. CYP1A2 inducers: CYP1A2 inducers could decrease the exposure of anagrelide. Patients taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., omeprazole) may need to have their dose titrated to compensate for the decrease in anagrelide exposure. CYP1A2 substrates: Anagrelide demonstrates limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 in vitro and may alter the exposure of concomitant CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline, fluvoxamine, ondansetron)."
