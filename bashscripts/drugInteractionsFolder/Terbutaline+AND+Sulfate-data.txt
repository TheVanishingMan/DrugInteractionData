Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants: Terbutaline should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within two weeks of discontinuation of such agents, since the action of terbutaline on the vascular system may be potentiated. Beta-Blockers: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as Terbutaline Sulfate Injection, USP, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. Diuretics: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics."

Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Terbutaline (%) 0.25 mg N=77 0.5 mg N=205 Reaction Central Nervous System Tremor 7.8 38 Nervousness 16.9 30.7 Dizziness 1.3 10.2 Headache 7.8 8.8 Drowsiness 11.7 9.8 Cardiovascular Palpitations 7.8 22.9 Tachycardia 1.3 1.5 Respiratory Dyspnea 0 2 Chest discomfort 1.3 1.5 Gastrointestinal Nausea/vomiting 1.3 3.9 Systemic Weakness 1.3 0.5 Flushed feeling 0 2.4 Sweating 0 2.5 Pain at injection site 2.6 0.5 Epinephrine (%) 0.25 mg N=153 0.5 mg N=61 Reaction Central Nervous System Tremor 16.3 18 Nervousness 8.5 31.1 Dizziness 7.8 3.3 Headache 3.3 9.8 Drowsiness 14.4 8.2 Cardiovascular Palpitations 7.8 29.5 Tachycardia 2.6 0 Respiratory Dyspnea 2 0 Chest discomfort 2.6 0 Gastrointestinal Nausea/vomiting 1.3 11.5 Systemic Weakness 2.6 1.6 Flushed feeling 1.3 0 Sweating 0 0 Pain at injection site 2.6 1.6 Note: Some patients received more than one dosage strength of terbutaline and epinephrine. In addition, there were reports of anxiety, muscle cramps, and dry mouth (<0.5%). There have been rare reports of elevations in liver enzymes and of hypersensitivity vasculitis with terbutaline administration."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions observed with terbutaline sulfate tablets, USP are similar to those commonly seen with other sympathomimetic amines. All of these reactions are generally transient in nature and usually do not require treatment. The frequency of these side effects appears to diminish with continued therapy. The following table lists the adverse reactions seen in 199 patients treated with terbutaline sulfate tablets during six double-blind crossover studies and four double-blind parallel studies (short- and long-term) performed in the United States.
