The most common adverse reactions in galantamine-treated patients from double-blind clinical trials (≥5%) were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and decreased appetite. The most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (≥1%) in galantamine-treated patients from double-blind clinical trials were nausea (6.2%), vomiting (3.3%), decreased appetite (1.5%), and dizziness (1.3%). The safety of the extended-release capsule and immediate-release tablet formulations of galantamine was evaluated in 3956 galantamine-treated patients who participated in 8 placebo-controlled clinical studies and 1454 subjects in 5 open-label clinical studies with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. In clinical studies, the safety profile of once-daily treatment with extended-release galantamine was similar in frequency and nature to that seen with tablets. The information presented in this section was derived from pooled double-blind studies and from pooled open-label data. Commonly-Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in ≥1% of galantamine-treated patients in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials.

Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Trials of Galantamine The following adverse reactions occurred in <1% of all galantamine-treated patients (N=3956) in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial data sets. In addition, the following also includes all adverse reactions reported at any frequency rate in patients (N=1454) who participated in open-label studies. Adverse reactions listed in Table 1 above were not included below: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dehydration Nervous System Disorders: Dysgeusia, Hypersomnia, Paresthesia Eye Disorders: Blurred vision Cardiac Disorders: First degree atrioventricular block, Palpitations, Sinus bradycardia, Supraventricular extrasystoles Vascular Disorders: Flushing, Hypotension Gastrointestinal Disorders: Retching Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Hyperhidrosis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Muscular weakness Discontinuations Due to Adverse Reactions In the 8 placebo-controlled studies of adults, 418 (10.6%) galantamine-treated patients (N=3956) and 56 (2.2%) placebo patients (N=2546) discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Those events with an incidence of ≥0.5% in the galantamine-treated patients included nausea (245, 6.2%), vomiting (129, 3.3%), decreased appetite (60, 1.5%), dizziness (50, 1.3%), diarrhea (31, 0.8%), headache (29, 0.7%), and decreased weight (26, 0.7%). The only event with an incidence of ≥0.5% in placebo patients was nausea (17, 0.7%). In the 5 open-label studies, 103 (7.1%) patients (N=1454) discontinued due to an adverse reaction.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious skin reactions: discontinue at first appearance of skin rash (5.1) All patients should be considered at risk for adverse effects on cardiac conduction, including bradycardia and AV block, due to vagotonic effects on sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (5.3) Active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding: monitor, especially those with an increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction (5.5) Monitor for respiratory adverse events in patients with a history of severe asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.7) 5.1 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) have been reported in patients receiving GALANTAMINE HBr ER and GALANTAMINE HBr. Inform patients and caregivers that the use of GALANTAMINE HBr ER or GALANTAMINE HBr should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a serious skin reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. 5.2 Anesthesia Galantamine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate the neuromuscular blocking effects of succinylcholine-type and similar neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia. 5.3 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, leading to bradycardia and AV block. Bradycardia and all types of heart block have been reported in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Therefore, all patients should be considered at risk for adverse effects on cardiac conduction. Patients treated with galantamine up to 24 mg/day using the recommended dosing schedule showed a dose-related increase in risk of syncope (placebo 0.7% [2/286]; 4 mg twice daily 0.4% [3/692]; 8 mg twice daily 1.3% [7/552]; 12 mg twice daily 2.2% [6/273]). 5.4 Gastrointestinal Conditions Through their primary action, cholinomimetics may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those with an increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or patients using concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of galantamine have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Galantamine, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. During therapy, the patient's weight should be monitored. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although this was not observed in clinical trials with galantamine, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions Seizures: Cholinesterase inhibitors are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Seizure activity may also be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease should be monitored closely for seizures while taking galantamine. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of its cholinomimetic action, galantamine should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of severe asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory function should be monitored closely for the occurrence of respiratory adverse effects. 5.8 Deaths in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) In two randomized placebo controlled trials of 2 years duration in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a total of 13 patients on galantamine (n=1026) and 1 patient on placebo (n=1022) died. The deaths were due to various causes which could be expected in an elderly population; about half of the galantamine deaths appeared to result from various vascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death). Although the difference in mortality between galantamine- and placebo-treated groups in these two studies was significant, the results are highly discrepant with other studies of galantamine. Specifically, in these two MCI studies, the mortality rate in the placebo-treated patients was markedly lower than the rate in placebo-treated patients in trials of galantamine in Alzheimer's disease or other dementias (0.7 per 1000 person years compared to 22–61 per 1000 person years, respectively). Although the mortality rate in the galantamine-treated MCI patients was also lower than that observed in galantamine-treated patients in Alzheimer's disease and other dementia trials (10.2 per 1000 person years compared to 23–31 per 1000 person years, respectively), the relative difference was much less. When the Alzheimer's disease and other dementia studies were pooled (n=6000), the mortality rate in the placebo group numerically exceeded that in the galantamine group. Furthermore, in the MCI studies, no patients in the placebo group died after 6 months, a highly unexpected finding in this population. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment demonstrate isolated memory impairment greater than expected for their age and education, but do not meet current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions ) Use With Anticholinergics RAZADYNE® has the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. Use With Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect is expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, other cholinesterase inhibitors, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol. A) Effect of Other Drugs on Galantamine In vitro CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the major enzymes involved in the metabolism of galantamine. CYP3A4 mediates the formation of galantamine-N-oxide; CYP2D6 leads to the formation of O-desmethyl-galantamine. Because galantamine is also glucuronidated and excreted unchanged, no single pathway appears predominant. In vivo Cimetidine and Ranitidine: Galantamine was administered as a single dose of 4 mg on day 2 of a 3-day treatment with either cimetidine (800 mg daily) or ranitidine (300 mg daily). Cimetidine increased the bioavailability of galantamine by approximately 16%. Ranitidine had no effect on the PK of galantamine. Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, at a dose of 200 mg BID for 4 days, increased the AUC of galantamine by 30%. Erythromycin : Erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 at a dose of 500 mg QID for 4 days, affected the AUC of galantamine minimally (10% increase). Paroxetine: Paroxetine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, at 20 mg/day for 16 days, increased the oral bioavailability of galantamine by about 40%. Memantine: Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, at a dose of 10 mg BID, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of galantamine (16 mg/day) at steady state. B) Effect of Galantamine on Other Drugs In vitro Galantamine did not inhibit the metabolic pathways catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, CYP4A, CYP2C, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1. This indicates that the inhibitory potential of galantamine towards the major forms of cytochrome P450 is very low. In vivo Warfarin: Galantamine at 24 mg/day had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin (25 mg single dose) or on the prothrombin time. The protein binding of warfarin was unaffected by galantamine. Digoxin: Galantamine at 24 mg/day had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.375 mg once daily) when they were coadministered. In this study, however, one healthy subject was hospitalized for 2nd and 3rd degree heart block and bradycardia."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience: The specific adverse event data described in this section are based on studies of the immediate-release tablet formulation. In clinical trials, once-daily treatment with RAZADYNE® ER (galantamine hydrobromide) Extended-Release Capsules was well tolerated and adverse events were similar to those seen with RAZADYNE® Tablets. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation: In two large scale, placebo-controlled trials of 6 months duration in which patients were titrated weekly from 8 to 16 to 24, and to 32 mg/day, the risk of discontinuation because of an adverse event in the galantamine group exceeded that in the placebo group by about threefold. In contrast, in a 5-month trial with escalation of the dose by 8 mg/day every 4 weeks, the overall risk of discontinuation because of an adverse event was 7%, 7%, and 10% for the placebo, galantamine 16 mg/day, and galantamine 24 mg/day groups, respectively, with gastrointestinal adverse effects the principle reason for discontinuing galantamine. Table 1 shows the most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in this study. Table 1: Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation in a Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Trial With a 4-Week Dose Escalation Schedule 4-Week Escalation Placebo 16 mg/day 24 mg/day Adverse Event N=286 N=279 N=273 Nausea <1% 2% 4% Vomiting 0% 1% 3% Anorexia <1% 1% <1% Dizziness <1% 2% 1% Syncope 0% 0% 1% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials: The reported adverse events in trials using RAZADYNE® (galantamine hydrobromide) Tablets reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions in a highly selected patient population. In actual practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior and the types of patients treated may differ. The majority of these adverse events occurred during the dose-escalation period. In those patients who experienced the most frequent adverse event, nausea, the median duration of the nausea was 5-7 days. Administration of RAZADYNE® with food, the use of anti-emetic medication, and ensuring adequate fluid intake may reduce the impact of these events. The most frequent adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and at least twice the rate on placebo with the recommended maintenance dose of either 16 or 24 mg/day of RAZADYNE® under conditions of every 4-week dose-escalation for each dose increment of 8 mg/day, are shown in Table 2 . These events were primarily gastrointestinal and tended to be less frequent with the 16 mg/day recommended initial maintenance dose. Table 2: The Most Frequent Adverse Events in the Placebo-Controlled Trial With Dose Escalation Every 4 Weeks Occurring in at Least 5% of Patients Receiving RAZADYNE® and at Least Twice the Rate on Placebo.

There were no important differences in adverse event rates related to dose or sex. Therewere too few non-Caucasian patients to assess the effects of race on adverse event rates. No clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values were observed. Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials RAZADYNE® Tablets were administered to 3055 patients with Alzheimer's disease. A total of 2357 patients received galantamine in placebo-controlled trials and 761 patients with Alzheimer's disease received galantamine 24 mg/day, the maximum recommended maintenance dose. About 1000 patients received galantamine for at least one year and approximately 200 patients received galantamine for two years. To establish the rate of adverse events, data from all patients receiving any dose of galantamine in 8 placebo-controlled trials and 6 open-label extension trials were pooled. The methodology to gather and codify these adverse events was standardized across trials, using WHO terminology. All adverse events occurring in approximately 0.1% are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, or events unlikely to be drug caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events - those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to RAZADYNE® treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies. Additional adverse events observed in other clinical trials are also included below. Body As a Whole – General Disorders: Frequent: chest pain, asthenia, fever, malaise Cardiovascular System Disorders: Infrequent: postural hypotension, hypotension, dependent edema, cardiac failure, myocardial ischemia or infarction Central & Peripheral Nervous System Disorders: Infrequent : vertigo, hypertonia, convulsions, involuntary muscle contractions, paresthesia, ataxia, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, apraxia, aphasia, leg cramps, tinnitus, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident Gastrointestinal System Disorders: Frequent: flatulence; Infrequent: gastritis, melena, dysphagia, rectal hemorrhage, dry mouth, saliva increased, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis, hiccup; Rare: esophageal perforation Heart Rate & Rhythm Disorders: Infrequent: AV block, palpitation, atrial arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia, QT prolonged, bundle branch block, T-wave inversion, ventricular tachycardia; Rare: severe bradycardia Metabolic& Nutritional Disorders: Infrequent : hyperglycemia, alkaline phosphatase increased Platelet, Bleeding& Clotting Disorders: Infrequent : purpura, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia Psychiatric Disorders: Infrequent: apathy, paroniria, paranoid reaction, libido increased, delirium; Rare: suicidal ideation, suicide Urinary System Disorders: Frequent: incontinence; Infrequent: hematuria, micturition frequency, cystitis, urinary retention, nocturia, renal calculi Post-Marketing Experience: Other adverse events from post-approval controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials and post-marketing experience observed in patients treated with RAZADYNE® include: Body as a Whole – General Disorders: dehydration (including rare, severe cases leading to renal insufficiency and renal failure) Psychiatric Disorders: aggression Gastrointestinal System Disorders: upper and lower GI bleeding, stomach discomfort, abdominal discomfort Hepatobiliary Disorders:elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis Metabolic& Nutritional Disorders: hypokalemia Nervous System Disorders: lethargy, dysgeusia, hypersomnia Eye disorders: vision blurred These adverse events may or may not be causally related to the drug."

If signs or symptoms suggest a serious skin reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. 5.2 Anesthesia Galantamine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate the neuromuscular blocking effects of succinylcholine-type and similar neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia. 5.3 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, leading to bradycardia and AV block. Bradycardia and all types of heart block have been reported in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Therefore, all patients should be considered at risk for adverse effects on cardiac conduction. Patients treated with galantamine up to 24 mg/day using the recommended dosing schedule showed a dose-related increase in risk of syncope (placebo 0.7% [2/286]; 4 mg twice daily 0.4% [3/692]; 8 mg twice daily 1.3% [7/552]; 12 mg twice daily 2.2% [6/273]). 5.4 Gastrointestinal Conditions Through their primary action, cholinomimetics may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those with an increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or patients using concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of galantamine have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Galantamine, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. During therapy, the patient's weight should be monitored. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although this was not observed in clinical trials with galantamine, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions Seizures: Cholinesterase inhibitors are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Seizure activity may also be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease should be monitored closely for seizures while taking galantamine. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of its cholinomimetic action, galantamine should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of severe asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory function should be monitored closely for the occurrence of respiratory adverse effects. 5.8 Deaths in Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) In two randomized placebo controlled trials of 2 years duration in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a total of 13 patients on galantamine (n=1026) and 1 patient on placebo (n=1022) died. The deaths were due to various causes which could be expected in an elderly population; about half of the galantamine deaths appeared to result from various vascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death). Although the difference in mortality between galantamine- and placebo-treated groups in these two studies was significant, the results are highly discrepant with other studies of galantamine. Specifically, in these two MCI studies, the mortality rate in the placebo-treated patients was markedly lower than the rate in placebo-treated patients in trials of galantamine in Alzheimer's disease or other dementias (0.7 per 1000 person years compared to 22–61 per 1000 person years, respectively). Although the mortality rate in the galantamine-treated MCI patients was also lower than that observed in galantamine-treated patients in Alzheimer's disease and other dementia trials (10.2 per 1000 person years compared to 23–31 per 1000 person years, respectively), the relative difference was much less. When the Alzheimer's disease and other dementia studies were pooled (n=6000), the mortality rate in the placebo group numerically exceeded that in the galantamine group. Furthermore, in the MCI studies, no patients in the placebo group died after 6 months, a highly unexpected finding in this population. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment demonstrate isolated memory impairment greater than expected for their age and education, but do not meet current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease."
