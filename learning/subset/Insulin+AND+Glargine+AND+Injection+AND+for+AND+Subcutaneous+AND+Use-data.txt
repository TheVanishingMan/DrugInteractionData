        "DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine."$

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection * 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection* 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection* 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tables 5, 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (<=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and <=36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN Trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) The ORIGIN trial was conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular risk, with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or early (antidiabetic drug treatment limited to none or at most one OAD) type 2 diabetes mellitus. It compared once-daily LANTUS to standard management of hyperglycemia (\\"Standard Care\\"). Overall, severe hypoglycemia was reported for 3.7% of these participants over the course of this 6 year study (approximately 0.6% per participants year) while participants had a median HbA1c below 6.5% throughout follow-up [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 7 displays the incidence and rate (affected participants per 100 participants-years of exposure) of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial. Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial ORIGIN Trial Early Type 2 Diabetes, IFG/IGT at high CV risk Adults 6.2 years LANTUS Standard Care Number of participants with at least one episode (N=total number of participants) 352 (6231) 113 (6273) Number per 100 participant-years 1.05 0.30 Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 8. Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference* ,  (SE) 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5%) 71/487 (14.6%) - 2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% Difference = Lantus - NPH using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."$
      "warnings_and_cautions": [$
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]."$

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. - Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5)] . - Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [$
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Never share a NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). -NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product (5.2). -Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2, 5.3). -Insulin, particularly when given in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.4). -Like all insulins, NovoLog Mix 70/30 requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.5, 5.6). -Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.7). -Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.9). 5.1 Never Share a NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Administration The short and long-acting components of insulin mixes, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cannot be titrated independently. Because NovoLog Mix 70/30 has peak pharmacodynamic activity between 1-4 hours after injection, it should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . The dose of insulin required to provide adequate glycemic control for one of the meals may result in hyper- or hypoglycemia for the other meal. The pharmacodynamic profile may also be inadequate for patients who require more frequent meals. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used intravenously. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used in insulin infusion pumps. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. Changes may also be necessary during illness, emotional stress, and other physiologic stress in addition to changes in meals and exercise. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all insulins may be altered by the site used for injection and the degree of vascularization of the site. Smoking, temperature, and exercise contribute to variations in blood flow and insulin absorption. These and other factors contribute to inter- and intra-patient variability. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy, including NovoLog Mix 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog Mix 70/30. The timing of hypoglycemia may reflect the time-action profile of the insulin formulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . Other factors, such as changes in dietary intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g. patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g. patients using potassium-lowering medications or patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations). 5.5 Renal Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of renal impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions- As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of NovoLog Mix 70/30 injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog Mix 70/30. In some instances, these reactions may be related to the insulin molecule, other components in the insulin preparation including protamine and cresol, components in skin cleansing agents, or injection techniques. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient. Systemic Reactions- Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life threatening. 5.8 Antibody Production Specific anti-insulin antibodies as well as cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies were monitored in a 3-month, open-label comparator trial as well as in a long-term extension trial. Changes in cross-reactive antibodies were more common after NovoLog Mix 70/30 than with Novolin 70/30 but these changes did not correlate with change in HbA1c or increase in insulin dose. In this study, antibodies did not increase further after long-term exposure (>6 months) to NovoLog Mix 70/30. The presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency towards hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 5.9 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure Can Occur with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following: Body as Whole: allergic reactions (see PRECAUTIONS, Allergy). Skin and Appendages: lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash. Mild injection site reactions occurred more frequently with LEVEMIR than with NPH human insulin and usually resolved in a few days to a few weeks (see PRECAUTIONS, Allergy). Other: Hypoglycemia: (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia with LEVEMIR was comparable to the incidence with NPH, and, as expected, greater overall in patients with type 1 diabetes (Table 4). Weight gain: In trials of up to 6 months duration in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, LEVEMIR was associated with somewhat less weight gain than NPH (Table 4). Whether these observed differences represent true differences in the effects of LEVEMIR and NPH insulin is not known, since these trials were not blinded and the protocols (e.g., diet and exercise instructions and monitoring) were not specifically directed at exploring hypotheses related to weight effects of the treatments compared. The clinical significance of the observed differences has not been established.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: -Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] -Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] -Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with TRESIBA are: -hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of TRESIBA was evaluated in nine treat to target trials of 6-12 months duration, conducted in subjects with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 1102 patients with type 1 diabetes to TRESIBA with a mean exposure duration to TRESIBA of 34 weeks. The mean age was 43 years and 1% were older than 75 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 81% were White, 2% were Black or African American and 4% were Hispanic. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 18 years and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.8%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported in 11%, 16%, 7% and 0.5% respectively. The mean eGFR at baseline was 87 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 7% of the patients had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 2713 patients with type 2 diabetes to TRESIBA with a mean exposure duration to TRESIBA of 36 weeks. The mean age was 58 years and 3% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent were male, 71% were White, 7% were Black or African American and 13% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 30 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.3%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported for 14%, 10%, 6% and 0.6% of participants respectively. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 83 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 9% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia)occurring in TRESIBA treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in >=5% of the population studied. Hypoglycemia is not shown in these tables but discussed in a dedicated subsection below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=5% of TRESIBA-Treated Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adverse Reaction TRESIBA (n=1102) Nasopharyngitis 23.9 % Upper respiratory tract infection 11.9 % Headache 11.8 % Sinusitis 5.1 % Gastroenteritis 5.1 % Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=5% of TRESIBA-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adverse Reaction TRESIBA (n=2713) Nasopharyngitis 12.9 % Headache 8.8 % Upper respiratory tract infection 8.4 % Diarrhea 6.3 % Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including TRESIBA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for TRESIBA with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. The percent of participants randomized to TRESIBA who experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia in adult clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively, are shown in Table 3 and 4. No clinically important differences in risk of hypoglycemia between TRESIBA and comparators was observed in clinical trials. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. A Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia episode was defined as a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where a laboratory or a self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL or where a whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL (i.e., with or without the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms). Table 3: Percent (%) of Type 1 Diabetes Patients Experiencing at Least One Episode of Severe Hypoglycemia or Novo Nordisk Hypoglycemia\302\247 on TRESIBA in Adult Clinical Trials Study A + insulin aspart 52 weeks Study B + insulin aspart 26 weeks Study C + insulin aspart 26 weeks TRESIBA (N=472) TRESIBA (N=301) TRESIBA at the same time each day (N=165) TRESIBA at alternating times (N=164) Severe hypoglycemia Percent of patients 12.3% 10.6% 12.7% 10.4% Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia\302\247 Percent of patients 95.6% 93.0% 99.4% 93.9% \302\247 Novo Nordisk hypoglycemia: a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where a laboratory or a self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL or where a whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL (i.e., with or without the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms).

Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including TRESIBA and may be life threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, and itching) and urticaria were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including TRESIBA, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue) and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical program, lipodystrophy, lipohypertrophy, or lipoatrophy was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Injection Site Reactions Patients taking TRESIBA may experience injection site reactions, including injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoloration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass. In the clinical program, injection site reactions occurred in 3.8% of patients treated with TRESIBA. Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including TRESIBA, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin. In the clinical program after 52 weeks of treatment, patients with type 1 diabetes treated with TRESIBA gained an average of 1.8 kg and patients with type 2 diabetes treated with TRESIBA gained an average of 3.0 kg. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including TRESIBA, may cause sodium retention and edema. In the clinical program, peripheral edema occurred in 0.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 3.0% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with TRESIBA. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TRESIBA with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, may be misleading. In studies of type 1 diabetes patients, 95.9% of patients who received TRESIBA once daily were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the studies, including 89.7% that were positive at baseline. In studies of type 2 diabetes patients, 31.5% of patients who received TRESIBA once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the studies, including 14.5% that were positive at baseline. The antibody incidence rates for type 2 diabetes may be underreported due to potential assay interference by endogenous insulin in samples in these patients. The presence of antibodies that affect clinical efficacy may necessitate dose adjustments to correct for tendencies toward hyper or hypoglycemia. The incidence of anti-insulin degludec antibodies has not been established."$

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Never share a TRESIBA FlexTouch pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). - Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2). - Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3, 5.4, 6.1). - Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. DO NOT transfer TRESIBA into a syringe for administration as overdosage and severe hypoglycemia can result (5.4). - Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue TRESIBA, monitor and treat if indicated (5.5). - Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6). - Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7). 5.1 Never Share a TRESIBA FlexTouch Pen Between Patients TRESIBA FlexTouch disposable prefilled pens should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment may be needed. When converting from other insulin therapies to TRESIBA follow dosing recommendations [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including TRESIBA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). TRESIBA, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of TRESIBA may vary among different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between TRESIBA and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. Do not transfer TRESIBA from the TRESIBA pen to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including TRESIBA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue TRESIBA; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. TRESIBA is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin degludec or one of the excipients [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including TRESIBA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Congestive Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of a PPAR Gamma Agonist Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists can cause dose related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including TRESIBA and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Adverse reactions commonly associated with LANTUS include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi- aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2327 patients with type 1 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 38.5 years. Fifty four percent were male, 96.9% were Caucasian, 1.8 % were Black or African American and 2.7 % were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 25.1 kg/m 2. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1563 patients with type 2 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59.3 years. Fifty eight percent were male, 86.7% were Caucasian, 7.8 % were Black or African American and 9 % were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2. The frequencies of adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below.

Tables 5, and 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (<=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and <=36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Percentages of LANTUS-treated adult patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS N=292 NPH N=293 LANTUS N=264 NPH N=270 LANTUS N=310 NPH N=309 LANTUS N=174 NPH N=175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS N=289 NPH N=281 LANTUS N=259 NPH N=259 LANTUS N=513 NPH N=504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial ORIGIN Trial Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years LANTUS N=6231 Standard Care N=6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking LANTUS have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including LANTUS, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including LANTUS and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and LANTUS treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."$

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed ( 5.1) Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision ( 5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness ( 5.3, 6.1) Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4, 6.3) Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue LANTUS. Monitor and treat if indicated ( 5.5, 6.1) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs ( 5.7) 5.1 Never Share a LANTUS SoloStar Prefilled Pen, Syringe, or Needle between Patients LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using LANTUS vials must never reuse or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and anti-diabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including LANTUS. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. The long-acting effect of LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. 5.4 Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products, particularly between long-acting insulins and rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue LANTUS; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . LANTUS is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [ see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including LANTUS, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LANTUS, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism, requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose.

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See ] Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See ] Warnings and Precautions (5.4) Adverse reactions commonly associated with LANTUS include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema and weight gain.

The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below.

Tables 5, and 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (<=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and <=36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. [See ] Warnings and Precautions (5.3) The proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [ ] in adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were comparable for all treatment regimens (see and ). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. See Clinical Studies (14) Tables 5 6 Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [ ]. see Adverse Reactions (cardiovascular safety) Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN trial Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years ORIGIN Trial LANTUS Standard Care Percent of patients (n/total N) 5.6 (352/6231) 1.8 (113/6273) Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 8 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 8: Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference (SE) Difference = Lantus - NPH , using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5%) 71/487 (14.6%) - 2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See ]. Dosage and Administration (2.1) Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. Cardiovascular Safety The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 2-by-2, factorial design study. One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of LANTUS to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12,537 participants >= 50 years of age with abnormal glucose levels [i.e., impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)] or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular (i.e., CV) disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that LANTUS use could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care. Two co-primary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN. The first co-primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The second co-primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Participants were randomized to either LANTUS (N=6264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of <= 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N=6273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of participants were 75 years of age or older. The majority of participants were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were Caucasian, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m . Approximately 12% of participants had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors. 2 Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of participants randomized to LANTUS and standard care respectively at end of trial. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years [range: 8 days to 7.9 years]. The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the trial was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the LANTUS and standard care group respectively. The median dose of LANTUS at end of trial was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to LANTUS were using LANTUS at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the LANTUS group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was similar between groups (see ). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

Discontinue LANTUS. monitor and treat if indicated ( , ) 5.4 6.1 Renal or hepatic impairment: Reduce dose of LANTUS if indicated ( , ) 5.5 5.6 : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs ( ) Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) 5.8 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia . [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ ]. See Drug Interactions (7) The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.3) As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See ]. Drug Interactions (7) 5.8 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LANTUS, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

The following may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, salbutamol, terbutaline), isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), atypical antipsychotics (7). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin (7). Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may be followed by hyperglycemia (7). The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine (7)."$

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)] and [Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with some insulin therapies, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Frequencies of adverse drug reactions The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during a clinical trial with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with NovoLog Mix 70/30.

Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. They include medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NovoLog Mix 70/30 [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product (5.1). Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1,5.2). Insulin, particularly when given in settings of poor glycemic control, can cause hypokalemia. Use caution in patients predisposed to hypokalemia (5.3). Like all insulins, NovoLog Mix 70/30 requirements may be reduced in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment (5.4, 5.5). Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30 (5.6). 5.1 Administration The short and long-acting components of insulin mixes, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cannot be titrated independently. Because NovoLog Mix 70/30 has peak pharmacodynamic activity between 1-4 hours after injection, it should be administered within 15 minutes of meal initiation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . The dose of insulin required to provide adequate glycemic control for one of the meals may result in hyper- or hypoglycemia for the other meal. The pharmacodynamic profile may also be inadequate for patients who require more frequent meals. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with any other insulin product. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used intravenously. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used in insulin infusion pumps. Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Any change of insulin dose should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changing from one insulin product to another or changing the insulin strength may result in the need for a change in dosage. Changes may also be necessary during illness, emotional stress, and other physiologic stress in addition to changes in meals and exercise. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of all insulins may be altered by the site used for injection and the degree of vascularization of the site. Smoking, temperature, and exercise contribute to variations in blood flow and insulin absorption. These and other factors contribute to inter- and intra-patient variability. Needles and NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen must not be shared. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy, including NovoLog Mix 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with NovoLog Mix 70/30. The timing of hypoglycemia may reflect the time-action profile of the insulin formulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . Other factors, such as changes in dietary intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g. patients who are fasting or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as long duration of diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified diabetes control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.3 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including NovoLog Mix 70/30, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia that, if left untreated, may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g. patients using potassium-lowering medications or patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations). 5.4 Renal Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of renal impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.5 Hepatic Impairment Clinical or pharmacology studies with NovoLog Mix 70/30 in diabetic patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment have not been conducted. As with other insulins, the requirements for NovoLog Mix 70/30 may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Local Reactions- As with other insulin therapy, patients may experience reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of NovoLog Mix 70/30 injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of NovoLog Mix 70/30. In some instances, these reactions may be related to the insulin molecule, other components in the insulin preparation including protamine and cresol, components in skin cleansing agents, or injection techniques. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient. Systemic Reactions- Less common, but potentially more serious, is generalized allergy to insulin, which may cause rash (including pruritus) over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, reduction in blood pressure, rapid pulse, or sweating. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life threatening. 5.7 Antibody Production Specific anti-insulin antibodies as well as cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies were monitored in a 3-month, open-label comparator trial as well as in a long-term extension trial. Changes in cross-reactive antibodies were more common after NovoLog Mix 70/30 than with Novolin 70/30 but these changes did not correlate with change in HbA1c or increase in insulin dose. The clinical significance of these antibodies has not been established. Antibodies did not increase further after long-term exposure (>6 months) to NovoLog Mix 70/30."$

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism, requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Lantus are: Hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection * 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 * Body System not Specified Table 2: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH,% (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection * 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 * Body System not Specified Table 3: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (nj=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection* 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 * Body System not Specified Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (<=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 28 weeks with regular insulin Study B Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 28 weeks with regular insulin Study C Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 16 weeks with insulin lispro Study D Diabetes Adults In combination Type 1 26 weeks with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 52 weeks oral agents Study F Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 28 weeks regular insulin Study G Diabetes Adults In combination with Type 2 5 years regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/totalN) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 7. Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) Difference* ,  (SE) 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5) 71/487 (14.6%) -2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% * Difference = Lantus - NPH  using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."$

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]."$

(6.1, 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi- aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 304 patients with type 1 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 23 weeks. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 46 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty five percent were male, 86% were Caucasian, 5 % were Black or African American and 5 % were Hispanic. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 82 mL/min/1.73m2 and 35% of patients had eGFR>=90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was 28 kg/m2. HbA1c at baseline was greater or equal to 8% in 58% of patients. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1242 patients with type 2 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 25 weeks. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 13 years. Fifty three percent were male, 88% were Caucasian, 7% were Black or African American and 17% were Hispanic. At baseline, mean eGFR was 79 mL/min/1.73m2 and 27% of patients had an eGFR>=90 mL/min/1.73m2. The mean BMI was 35 kg/m2. HbA1c at baseline was greater or equal to 8% in 66% of patients. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in >=5% of the population studied. Common adverse reactions occurring for TOUJEO-treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Hypoglycemia is discussed in a dedicated subsection below. Table 1: Adverse reactions in two pooled clinical trials of 26 weeks and 16 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (with incidence >=5%) TOUJEO + mealtime insulin\\"mealtime insulin\\" refers to insulin glulisine, insulin lispro, or insulin aspart, % (n=304) Nasopharyngitis 12.8 Upper respiratory tract infection 9.5 Table 2: Adverse reactions in three pooled clinical trials of 26 weeks duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (with incidence >=5%) TOUJEOone of the trials in type 2 diabetes included mealtime insulin, % (n=1,242) Nasopharyngitis 7.1 Upper respiratory tract infection 5.7 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including TOUJEO [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In the TOUJEO program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action and documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with typical symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value equal to or less than 54 mg/dL. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6.6% at 26 weeks. The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was 69% at 26 weeks. There were no clinically important differences in hypoglycemia between TOUJEO and LANTUS among type 1 diabetes patients. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes was 5% at 26 weeks in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen, and 1.0% and 0.9% respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received TOUJEO as part of a basal-insulin only regimen. The incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving TOUJEO ranged from 8% to 37% at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen. Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including TOUJEO, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including TOUJEO, can cause lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including TOUJEO and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Allergic Reactions Some patients taking insulin therapy, including TOUJEO have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Cardiovascular Safety No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO. The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN [Hazard Ratio (95% CI) for MACE; 1.02 (0.94, 1.11)]. In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) [Hazard Ratio (95% CI); 0.99 (0.88, 1.11)] or death from cancer [Hazard Ratio (95% CI); 0.94 (0.77, 1.15)] was also similar between treatment groups. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In a 6-month study of type 1 diabetes patients, 79% of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 62% that were positive at baseline and 44% of patients who developed anti-drug antibody [i.e., anti-insulin glargine antibody (ADA)] during the study. Eighty percent of the AIA positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline, remained AIA positive at month 6. In two 6-month studies in type 2 diabetes patients, 25% of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the study, including 42% who were positive at baseline and 20% of patients who developed ADA during the study. Ninety percent of the AIA positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline, remained AIA positive at month 6. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TOUJEO with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products, may be misleading."$

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a TOUJEO SoloStar(R) disposable prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) Hyper- or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, co-administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness. (5.3, 6.1) Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. (5.4) Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue TOUJEO, monitor and treat if indicated (5.5, 6.1) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6). Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) 5.1 Never Share a TOUJEO SoloStar pen Between Patients TOUJEO SoloStar disposable prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and only under close medical supervision, and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral anti-diabetic products may be needed. On a unit to unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO according to labeling instructions, and adjust co-administered glucose lowering therapies per standard of care [See Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including TOUJEO. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [See Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of TOUJEO may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia do not administer TOUJEO intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump or dilute or mix TOUJEO with any other insulin products or solutions. 5.4 Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between basal insulin products and other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between TOUJEO and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including TOUJEO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue TOUJEO; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. TOUJEO is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or other of the excipients [See Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including TOUJEO, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including TOUJEO, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of medications that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or decrease the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. -Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose (7) -The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) (7)"$

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: -Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Adverse reactions associated with LEVEMIR include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) reported during LEVEMIR clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Tables 1-4 below. See Tables 5 and 6 for the hypoglycemia findings. In the LEVEMIR add-on to liraglutide+metformin trial, all patients received liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin during a 12-week run-in period. During the run-in period, 167 patients (17% of enrolled total) withdrew from the trial: 76 (46% of withdrawals) of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions and 15 (9% of withdrawals) doing so due to other adverse events. Only those patients who completed the run-in period with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to 26 weeks of add-on therapy with LEVEMIR or continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin. During this randomized 26-week period, diarrhea was the only adverse reaction reported in >=5% of patients treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg + metformin (11.7%) and greater than in patients treated with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin alone (6.9%). In two pooled trials, a total of 1155 adults with type 1 diabetes were exposed to individualized doses of LEVEMIR (n=767) or NPH (n=388). The mean duration of exposure to LEVEMIR was 153 days, and the total exposure to LEVEMIR was 321 patient-years. The most common adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1.

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] - Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LEVEMIR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials. For the adult trials and one of the pediatric trials (Study D), severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person and associated with either a plasma glucose value below 56 mg/dL (blood glucose below 50 mg/dL) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. For the other pediatric trial (Study I), severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semi-consciousness, unconsciousness, coma and/or convulsions in a patient who could not assist in the treatment and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose. For the adult trials and pediatric Study D, non-severe hypoglycemia was defined as an asymptomatic or symptomatic plasma glucose < 56 mg/dL (or equivalently blood glucose <50 mg/dL as used in Study A and C) that was self-treated by the patient. For pediatric Study I, non-severe hypoglycemia included asymptomatic events with plasma glucose <65 mg/dL as well as symptomatic events that the patient could self-treat or treat by taking oral therapy provided by the caregiver. The rates of hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable between LEVEMIR-treated patients and non-LEVEMIR-treated patients (see Tables 5 and 6).

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. - Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LEVEMIR, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . - Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria [see Clinical Studies (14)]. - Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LEVEMIR, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. - Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LEVEMIR may experience injection site reactions, including localized erythema, pain, pruritus, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adults, three patients treated with LEVEMIR reported injection site pain (0.25%) compared to one patient treated with NPH insulin (0.12%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LEVEMIR, and may be life-threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . - Antibody Production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. These insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LEVEMIR, antibody development has been observed with no apparent impact on glycemic control. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LEVEMIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported during post-approval use of LEVEMIR in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting or short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LEVEMIR [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LEVEMIR and other insulins, patients should be instructed always to verify the insulin label before each injection."$

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Never Share a LEVEMIR FlexTouch between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1). -Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.2) -Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump, intramuscularly, or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.3) -Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.4, 6.1) -Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.5) -Renal or hepatic impairment: May require adjustment of the LEVEMIR dose (5.6, 5.7) -Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are PPAR-gamma agonists, and insulin, including LEVEMIR (5.9) 5.1 Never Share a LEVEMIR FlexTouch Between Patients LEVEMIR FlexTouch must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in the insulin dose or an adjustment of concomitant anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LEVEMIR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.3 Administration LEVEMIR should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer LEVEMIR intravenously or intramuscularly. The intended duration of activity of LEVEMIR is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Do not use LEVEMIR in insulin infusion pumps. Do not dilute or mix LEVEMIR with any other insulin or solution. If LEVEMIR is diluted or mixed, the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LEVEMIR and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. When a GLP-1 receptor agonist is used in combination with LEVEMIR, the LEVEMIR dose may need to be lowered or more conservatively titrated to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. All patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion, or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LEVEMIR. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LEVEMIR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LEVEMIR. 5.6 Renal Impairment No difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of insulin detemir between non-diabetic individuals with renal impairment and healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with renal impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Non-diabetic individuals with severe hepatic impairment had lower systemic exposures to insulin detemir compared to healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with liver impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.8 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.9 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including LEVEMIR, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypokalemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with APIDRA include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of adverse drug reactions during APIDRA clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled studies of adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) APIDRA, % (n=950) All comparatorsInsulin lispro, regular human insulin, insulin aspart, % (n=641) Nasopharyngitis 10.6 12.9 HypoglycemiaOnly severe symptomatic hypoglycemia 6.8 6.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 6.6 5.6 Influenza 4.0 5.0 Table 2: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled studies of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) APIDRA, % (n=883) Regular human insulin, % (n=883) Upper respiratory tract infection 10.5 7.7 Nasopharyngitis 7.6 8.2 Edema peripheral 7.5 7.8 Influenza 6.2 4.2 Arthralgia 5.9 6.3 Hypertension 3.9 5.3 Pediatrics Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions occurring with frequency higher than 5% in a clinical study in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes treated with APIDRA (n=277) or insulin lispro (n=295). Table 3: Treatment -emergent adverse events in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse reactions with frequency >= 5%) APIDRA, % (n=277) Lispro, % (n=295) Nasopharyngitis 9.0 9.5 Upper respiratory tract infection 8.3 10.8 Headache 6.9 11.2 Hypoglycemic seizure 6.1 4.7 Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including APIDRA [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The rates and incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia requiring intervention from a third party, were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Table 4). In the phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to adults with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 4) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 4: Severe Symptomatic HypoglycemiaSevere symptomatic hypoglycemia defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring the assistance of another person that met one of the following criteria: the event was associated with a whole blood referenced blood glucose <36mg/dL or the event was associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Type 1 Diabetes Adults 12 weeks with insulin glargine Type 1 Diabetes Adults 26 weeks with insulin glargine Type 2 Diabetes Adults 26 weeks with NPH human insulin Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks APIDRA Pre-meal APIDRA Post-meal Regular Human Insulin APIDRA Insulin Lispro APIDRA Regular Human Insulin APIDRA Insulin Lispro Events per month per patient 0.05 0.05 0.13 0.02 0.02 0.00 0.00 0.09 0.08 Percent of patients (n/total N) 8.4% (24/286) 8.4% (25/296) 10.1% (28/278) 4.8% (16/339) 4.0% (13/333) 1.4% (6/416) 1.2% (5/420) 16.2% (45/277) 19.3% (57/295) Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including APIDRA, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including APIDRA, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including APIDRA, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) In a 12-week randomized study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n=59), the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for APIDRA and insulin aspart treated patients (Table 5). Table 5: Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions. APIDRA (n=29) insulin aspart (n=30) Catheter occlusions/month 0.08 0.15 Infusion site reactions 10.3% (3/29) 13.3% (4/30) Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking APIDRA may experience redness, swelling, or itching at the site of injection. These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions may require discontinuation of APIDRA. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur with any insulin, including APIDRA. Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash (including pruritus), dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. In controlled clinical trials up to 12 months duration, potential systemic allergic reactions were reported in 79 of 1833 patients (4.3%) who received APIDRA and 58 of 1524 patients (3.8%) who received the comparator short-acting insulins. During these trials treatment with APIDRA was permanently discontinued in 1 of 1833 patients due to a potential systemic allergic reaction. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of metacresol, which is an excipient of APIDRA. Antibody Production In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n=333), the concentrations of insulin antibodies that react with both human insulin and insulin glulisine (cross-reactive insulin antibodies) remained near baseline during the first 6 months of the study in the patients treated with APIDRA. A decrease in antibody concentration was observed during the following 6 months of the study. In a study in patients with type 2 diabetes (n=411), a similar increase in cross-reactive insulin antibody concentration was observed in the patients treated with APIDRA and in the patients treated with human insulin during the first 9 months of the study. Thereafter the concentration of antibodies decreased in the APIDRA patients and remained stable in the human insulin patients. There was no correlation between cross-reactive insulin antibody concentration and changes in HbA1c, insulin doses, or incidence of hypoglycemia. The clinical significance of these antibodies is not known. APIDRA did not elicit a significant antibody response in a study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of APIDRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly long-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of APIDRA [See Patient Counseling Information (17)] ."$

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an APIDRA SoloStar pen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) Do not reuse or share needles or syringes between patients (5.1) Dose adjustment and monitoring: Closely monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Change insulin regimens cautiously and only under medical supervision.(5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with any insulin, including APIDRA (5.4) Hypokalemia: All insulins, including APIDRA can cause hypokalemia, which if untreated, may result in respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death (5.5) Renal or hepatic impairment: Like all insulins, may require a reduction in the APIDRA dose (5.6) Mixing: APIDRA for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulins other than NPH insulin. Do not mix APIDRA with any insulin for intravenous administration or for use in a continuous infusion pump (5.7) Pump use: Change the APIDRA in the pump reservoir every 48 hours (5.8) Intravenous use: Frequently monitor for hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. (5.9) Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs (5.11) 5.1 Never share an APIDRA SoloStar pen or syringe or needle between patients APIDRA SoloStar pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using APIDRA vials must never reuse or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose. Concomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for APIDRA may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the site of injection, local blood supply, or local temperature. Patients who change their level of physical activity or meal plan may require adjustment of insulin dosages. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including APIDRA. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with tighter glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with APIDRA. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), injection site, exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Rapid changes in serum glucose levels may induce symptoms similar to hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes, regardless of the glucose value. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic nerve disease, use of medications such as beta-blockers [See Drug Interactions (7)], or intensified diabetes control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. Intravenously administered insulin has a more rapid onset of action than subcutaneously administered insulin, requiring closer monitoring for hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including APIDRA [See Adverse reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including APIDRA, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). Monitor glucose and potassium frequently when APIDRA is administered intravenously. 5.6 Renal or hepatic impairment Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. 5.7 Mixing of insulins APIDRA for subcutaneous injection should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin. If APIDRA is mixed with NPH insulin, APIDRA should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should occur immediately after mixing. Do not mix APIDRA with other insulins for intravenous administration or for use in a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump. APIDRA for intravenous administration should not be diluted with solutions other than 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). The efficacy and safety of mixing APIDRA with diluents or other insulins for use in external subcutaneous infusion pumps have not been established. 5.8 Subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps When used in an external insulin pump for subcutaneous infusion, APIDRA should not be diluted or mixed with any other insulin. APIDRA in the reservoir must be changed at least every 48 hours. APIDRA should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 98.6\302\260F (37\302\260C). Malfunction of the insulin pump or infusion set or handling errors or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia, ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with APIDRA may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available. [See Dosage and Administration (2.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.9 Intravenous administration When APIDRA is administered intravenously, glucose and potassium levels must be closely monitored to avoid potentially fatal hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Do not mix APIDRA with other insulins for intravenous administration. APIDRA may be diluted only in normal saline solution. 5.10 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.11 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including APIDRA and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."$

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of medications that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of medications that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or decrease the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose (7) The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine).

The frequencies of adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) reported during LEVEMIR clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Tables 1-4 below. See Tables 5 and 6 for the hypoglycemia findings.

Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Non-severe hypoglycemia was defined as an asymptomatic or symptomatic plasma glucose < 56 mg/dL (<50 mg/dL in Study A and C) that was self-treated by the patient. The rates of hypoglycemia in the LEVEMIR clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable between LEVEMIR-treated patients and non-LEVEMIR-treated patients (see Tables 5 and 6).

However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LEVEMIR, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin adsorption. Rotate insulin injection sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LEVEMIR, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LEVEMIR may experience injection site reactions, including localized erythema, pain, pruritis, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adults, three patients treated with LEVEMIR reported injection site pain (0.25%) compared to one patient treated with NPH insulin (0.12%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LEVEMIR, and may be life-threatening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Antibody Production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. These insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LEVEMIR, antibody development has been observed with no apparent impact on glycemic control. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LEVEMIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported during post-approval use of LEVEMIR in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting or short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LEVEMIR [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . To avoid medication errors between LEVEMIR and other insulins, patients should be instructed always to verify the insulin label before each injection."$

(5.4) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require adjustment of the LEVEMIR dose (5.5, 5.6). 5.1 Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in the insulin dose or an adjustment of concomitant anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LEVEMIR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration LEVEMIR should only be administered subcutaneously. Do not administer LEVEMIR intravenously or intramuscularly. The intended duration of activity of LEVEMIR is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Do not use LEVEMIR in insulin infusion pumps. Do not dilute or mix LEVEMIR with any other insulin or solution. If LEVEMIR is diluted or mixed, the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LEVEMIR and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy, including LEVEMIR. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion, or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LEVEMIR. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LEVEMIR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control [see Drug Interactions (7)] . These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LEVEMIR. 5.5 Renal Impairment No difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of insulin detemir between non-diabetic individuals with renal impairment and healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with renal impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Non-diabetic individuals with severe hepatic impairment had lower systemic exposures to insulin detemir compared to healthy volunteers. However, some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating insulin concentrations in patients with liver impairment. Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin, including LEVEMIR, may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.7 Drug Interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7)] ."$

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring. The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products, pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism, requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose. (7) The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine). (7)"$

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Lantus are: Hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 28 weeks duration in adults with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body System not Specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Treatment -emergent adverse events in pooled clinical trials up to 1 year duration in adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body System not Specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 5-year trial of adults with type 2 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 10%) LANTUS, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Treatment -emergent adverse events in a 28-week clinical trial of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (adverse events with frequency >= 5%) LANTUS, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection Body System not Specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including LANTUS [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (<=56 mg/dL in the 5-year trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. The rates of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials (see Section 14 for a description of the study designs) were comparable for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. (see Table 5) [See Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 10.6 (31/292) 15.0 (44/293) 8.7 (23/264) 10.4 (28/270) 6.5 (20/310) 5.2 (16/309) 23.0 (40/174) 28.6 (50/175) Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients (n/total N) 1.7 (5/289) 1.1 (3/281) 0.4 (1/259) 2.3 (6/259) 7.8 (40/513) 11.9 (60/504) Retinopathy Retinopathy was evaluated in the LANTUS clinical studies by analysis of reported retinal adverse events and fundus photography. The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 yrs) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with pre-specified post-baseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 7 for both the per-protocol and Intent-to-Treat populations, and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. Table 7. Number (%) of patients with 3 or more step progression on ETDRS scale at endpoint Lantus (%) NPH (%) DifferenceDifference = Lantus - NPH , using a generalized linear model (SAS GENMOD) with treatment and baseline HbA1c strata (cutoff 9.0%) as the classified independent variables, and with binomial distribution and identity link function (SE) 95% CI for difference Per-protocol 53/374 (14.2%) 57/363 (15.7%) -2.0% (2.6%) -7.0% to +3.1% Intent-to-Treat 63/502 (12.5%) 71/487 (14.6%) - 2.1% (2.1%) -6.3% to +2.1% Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including LANTUS, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including LANTUS, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including LANTUS, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in LANTUS-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. In some instances, these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin, such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique. Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. Systemic Allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including LANTUS and may be life threatening. Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.2 Postmarketing experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LANTUS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [See Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection."$

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dose adjustment and monitoring: Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin. Insulin regimens should be modified cautiously and only under medical supervision (5.1) Administration: Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur (5.2) Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients (5.2) Hypoglycemia: Most common adverse reaction of insulin therapy and may be life-threatening (5.3, 6.1) Allergic reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur (5.4, 6.1) Renal or hepatic impairment: May require a reduction in the LANTUS dose (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy. Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision. Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions, including the local blood supply, local temperature, and physical activity. 5.2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. If LANTUS is diluted or mixed, the solution may become cloudy, and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile (e.g., onset of action, time to peak effect) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner. When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs, a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed. The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin. The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown. Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients, because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin, including LANTUS. The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with LANTUS. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulations. Other factors such as changes in food intake (e.g., amount of food or timing of meals), exercise, and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7) ]. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20% from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with all insulins, use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake). The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions, such as longstanding diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, use of medications such as beta-blockers, or intensified glycemic control. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia (and, possibly, loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including LANTUS. 5.5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action, Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia. Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment, a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism, similar to observations found with other insulins. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [See Drug Interactions (7)]."$
