        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration with amiodarone may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. Use of HARVONI with amiodarone is not recommended (5.1, 6.2, 7.2) P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort): May alter concentrations of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers is not recommended (5.2, 7, 12.3) Consult the full prescribing information prior to use for potential drug interactions (5.1, 5.2, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Potential for Drug Interaction As HARVONI contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with HARVONI. After oral administration of HARVONI, sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic extraction. In clinical pharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and the inactive metabolite GS-331007 were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of coadministered substrates for these transporters. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI, and the use with P-gp inducers is not recommended with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 7.2 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either HARVONI, the components of HARVONI (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) as individual agents, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 4 Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted InteractionThis table is not all inclusive. Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration| = decrease, | = increase Clinical Comment tenofovir DF = tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Acid Reducing Agents: | ledipasvir Ledipasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease concentration of ledipasvir. Antacids (e.g., aluminum and magnesium hydroxide) It is recommended to separate antacid and HARVONI administration by 4 hours. H2-receptor antagonistsThese interactions have been studied in healthy adults. (e.g., famotidine) H2-receptor antagonists may be administered simultaneously with or 12 hours apart from HARVONI at a dose that does not exceed doses comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) Proton-pump inhibitor doses comparable to omeprazole 20 mg or lower can be administered simultaneously with HARVONI under fasted conditions. Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone Effect on amiodarone, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir concentrations unknown Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended; if coadministration is required, cardiac monitoring is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. digoxin | digoxin Coadministration of HARVONI with digoxin may increase the concentration of digoxin. Therapeutic concentration monitoring of digoxin is recommended when coadministered with HARVONI. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine phenytoin phenobarbital oxcarbazepine | ledipasvir | sofosbuvir Coadministration of HARVONI with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or oxcarbazepine is expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Coadministration is not recommended. Antimycobacterials: rifabutin rifampin rifapentine | ledipasvir | sofosbuvir Coadministration of HARVONI with rifabutin or rifapentine is expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Coadministration is not recommended. Coadministration of HARVONI with rifampin, a P-gp inducer, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. HIV Antiretrovirals: Regimens containing tenofovir DF without a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat | tenofovir Monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions in patients receiving HARVONI concomitantly with a regimen containing tenofovir DF without a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat. Refer to VIREAD or TRUVADA prescribing information for recommendations on renal monitoring. Regimens containing tenofovir DF and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat atazanavir/ritonavir or cobicistat + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF darunavir/ritonavir or cobicistat + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF lopinavir/ritonavir + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF | tenofovir The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of HARVONI and a HIV protease inhibitor/ritonavir or cobicistat has not been established. Consider alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in tenofovir exposures. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Refer to VIREAD or TRUVADA prescribing information for recommendations on renal monitoring. elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir DF | tenofovir The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of HARVONI and the combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF has not been established. Coadministration is not recommended. tipranavir/ritonavir | ledipasvir | sofosbuvir Coadministration of HARVONI with tipranavir/ritonavir is expected to decrease the concentration of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Coadministration is not recommended. HCV Products: simeprevir | ledipasvir | simeprevir Concentrations of ledipasvir and simeprevir are increased when simeprevir is coadministered with ledipasvir. Coadministration of HARVONI with simeprevir is not recommended. Herbal Supplements: St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) | ledipasvir | sofosbuvir Coadministration of HARVONI with St. John's wort, a P-gp inducer is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: rosuvastatin | rosuvastatin Coadministration of HARVONI with rosuvastatin may significantly increase the concentration of rosuvastatin which is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Coadministration of HARVONI with rosuvastatin is not recommended. 7.3 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with HARVONI Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of HARVONI (ledipasvir or sofosbuvir) or HARVONI, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when HARVONI is used with the following drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: abacavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, cyclosporine, darunavir/ritonavir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, lamivudine, methadone, oral contraceptives, pravastatin, raltegravir, rilpivirine, tacrolimus, or verapamil. See Table 4 for use of HARVONI with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]."$

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling: Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) observed with treatment with HARVONI were fatigue, headache and asthenia (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. If HARVONI is administered with ribavirin, refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin for a description of ribavirin-associated adverse reactions. The safety assessment of HARVONI was based on pooled data from three randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trials (ION-3, ION-1 and ION-2) of subjects with genotype 1 HCV with compensated liver disease (with and without cirrhosis) including 215, 539, and 326 subjects who received HARVONI once daily by mouth for 8, 12 and 24 weeks, respectively [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0%, less than 1%, and 1% for subjects receiving HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) were fatigue and headache in subjects treated with 8, 12, or 24 weeks of HARVONI. Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in at least 5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks treatment with HARVONI in clinical trials. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 2 occurred at severity of grade 1. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs. Table 2 Adverse Reactions (All Grades) Reported in >=5% of Subjects Receiving 8, 12, or 24 Weeks of Treatment with HARVONI HARVONI 8 weeks HARVONI 12 weeks HARVONI 24 weeks N=215 N=539 N=326 Fatigue 16% 13% 18% Headache 11% 14% 17% Nausea 6% 7% 9% Diarrhea 4% 3% 7% Insomnia 3% 5% 6% The safety assessment of HARVONI was also based on pooled data from three open-label trials (Study 1119, ION-4 and ELECTRON-2) in 118 subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5 or 6 infection with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The subjects received HARVONI once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The safety profile in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 4, 5 or 6 infection with compensated liver disease was similar to that observed in subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection with compensated liver disease. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of subjects were asthenia (18%), headache (14%) and fatigue (10%). Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Cirrhosis The safety assessment of HARVONI with or without ribavirin was based on a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial in treatment-experienced genotype 1 subjects with compensated cirrhosis and was compared to placebo in the SIRIUS trial. Subjects were randomized to receive 24 weeks of HARVONI once daily by mouth without ribavirin or 12 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks of HARVONI once daily by mouth + ribavirin [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Table 3 presents the adverse reactions, as defined above, that occurred with at least 5% greater frequency in subjects treated with 24 weeks of HARVONI or 12 weeks of HARVONI + ribavirin, compared to those reported for 12 weeks of placebo. The majority of the adverse reactions presented in Table 3 were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Table 3 Adverse Reactions with >=5% Greater Frequency Reported in Treatment-Experienced Subjects with Cirrhosis Receiving HARVONI for 24 Weeks or HARVONI+RBV for 12 Weeks Compared to Placebo for 12 weeks HARVONI 24 weeks (N=78) HARVONI+RBV 12 weeks (N=76) Placebo 12 weeks (N=77) Asthenia 31% 36% 23% Headache 29% 13% 16% Fatigue 18% 4% 1% Cough 5% 11% 1% Myalgia 9% 4% 0 Dyspnea 3% 9% 1% Irritability 8% 7% 1% Dizziness 5% 1% 0 Adverse Reactions in Subjects Co-infected with HIV-1 The safety assessment of HARVONI was based on an open-label clinical trial in 335 genotype 1 or 4 subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection who were on stable antiretroviral therapy in Study ION-4 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . The safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of subjects were headache (20%) and fatigue (17%). Adverse Reactions in Liver Transplant Recipients and/or Subjects with Decompensated Cirrhosis The safety assessment of HARVONI with ribavirin (RBV) in liver transplant recipients and/or those who had decompensated liver disease was based on pooled data from two Phase 2 open-label clinical trials including 336 subjects who received HARVONI plus RBV for 12 weeks. Subjects with Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores greater than 12 were excluded from the trials [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The adverse events observed were consistent with the expected clinical sequelae of liver transplantation and/or decompensated liver disease, or the known safety profile of HARVONI and/or ribavirin. Decreases in hemoglobin to less than 10 g/dL and 8.5 g/dL during treatment were observed in 38% and 13% of subjects treated with HARVONI plus RBV for 12 weeks, respectively. Ribavirin was permanently discontinued in 11% of subjects treated with HARVONI plus RBV for 12 weeks. Liver Transplant Recipients with Compensated Liver Disease: Among the 174 liver transplant recipients with compensated liver disease who received HARVONI with RBV for 12 weeks, 2 (1%) subjects permanently discontinued HARVONI due to an adverse event. Subjects with Decompensated Liver Disease: Among the 162 subjects with decompensated liver disease (pre- or post-transplant) who received HARVONI with RBV for 12 weeks, 7 (4%) subjects died, 4 (2%) subjects underwent liver transplantation, and 1 subject (<1%) underwent liver transplantation and died during treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Because these events occurred in patients with advanced liver disease who are at risk of progression of liver disease including liver failure and death, it is not possible to reliably assess the contribution of drug effect to outcomes. A total of 4 (2%) subjects permanently discontinued HARVONI due to an adverse event. Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials (less than 5%): The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects receiving HARVONI in any one trial. These events have been included because of their seriousness or assessment of potential causal relationship. Psychiatric disorders: depression (including in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness). Depression (particularly in subjects with pre-existing history of psychiatric illness) occurred in subjects receiving sofosbuvir containing regimens. Suicidal ideation and suicide have occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or pegylated interferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials. Laboratory Abnormalities Bilirubin Elevations: Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5\303\227ULN were observed in 3%, less than 1%, and 2% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Bilirubin elevations of greater than 1.5\303\227ULN were observed in 3%, 11% and 3% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, HARVONI + ribavirin for 12 weeks and HARVONI for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial. Lipase Elevations: Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3\303\227ULN were observed in less than 1%, 2%, and 3% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 8, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively. Transient, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3\303\227 ULN were observed in 1%, 3% and 9% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis treated with placebo, HARVONI + ribavirin for 12 weeks and HARVONI for 24 weeks, respectively, in the SIRIUS trial. Creatine Kinase: Creatine kinase was not assessed in Phase 3 trials ION-3, ION-1 or ION-2 of HARVONI. Creatine kinase was assessed in the ION-4 trial. Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations of greater than or equal to 10\303\227ULN was observed in 1% of subjects treated with HARVONI for 12 weeks in the ION-4 trial and has also been previously reported in subjects treated with sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon/ribavirin in other clinical trials. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HARVONI. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with HARVONI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Skin rashes, sometimes with blisters or angioedema-like swelling"$
      "warnings_and_cautions": [$
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bradycardia with amiodarone coadministration: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone, particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (5.1, 6.2, 7.2) Use with other drugs containing sofosbuvir is not recommended (5.4) 5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with HARVONI. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered HARVONI: Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking HARVONI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting HARVONI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers The concomitant use of HARVONI and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Therefore, the use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.3 Risks Associated with Ribavirin Combination Treatment If HARVONI is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.4 Related Products Not Recommended The use of HARVONI with other products containing sofosbuvir is not recommended."$
