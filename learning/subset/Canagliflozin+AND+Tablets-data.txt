        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cationic drugs: May reduce metformin elimination (7.1) UGT inducers (e.g., rifampin): Canagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider increasing canagliflozin dose from 50 mg to 150 mg twice daily (2.3, 7.2) Digoxin: Monitor digoxin levels (7.2) 7.1 Drug Interactions with Metformin Cationic Drugs Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of INVOKAMET and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently decrease serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs may induce metabolic acidosis and may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of acidosis when these drugs are used concomitantly with INVOKAMET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving INVOKAMET, monitor for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving INVOKAMET, monitor for hypoglycemia. 7.2 Drug Interactions with Canagliflozin UGT Enzyme Inducers Rifampin: Rifampin lowered canagliflozin exposure which may reduce the efficacy of INVOKAMET. If an inducer of UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) must be co-administered with INVOKAMET, consider increasing the dose to canagliflozin 150 mg twice daily if patients are currently tolerating INVOKAMET with 50 mg canagliflozin twice daily, have an eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and require additional glycemic control. Consider other antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer and require additional glycemic control [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Digoxin Canagliflozin increased digoxin exposure. Digoxin, as a cationic drug, also has the potential to compete with metformin for common renal tubular transport systems [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor patients taking INVOKAMET with concomitant digoxin for a need to adjust dose of either drug. Drug/Laboratory Test Interference Positive Urine Glucose Test Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control."$$

Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials Canagliflozin The data in Table 1 is derived from four 26-week placebo-controlled trials. In one trial canagliflozin was used as monotherapy and in three trials canagliflozin was used as add-on therapy with metformin (with or without other agents) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These data reflect exposure of 1667 patients to canagliflozin and a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 24 weeks with 1275 subjects exposed to a combination of canagliflozin and metformin. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N=833), canagliflozin 300 mg (N=834) or placebo (N=646) once daily. The mean daily dose of metformin was 2138 mg (SD 337.3) for the 1275 subjects in the three placebo-controlled metformin add-on studies. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population was male and 72% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian, and 5% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.3 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 20% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 88 mL/min/1.73 m2). Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of canagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on canagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either canagliflozin 100 mg or canagliflozin 300 mg. Table 1: Adverse Reactions From Pool of Four 26\\342\\210\\222Week Placebo-Controlled Studies Reported in >= 2% of Canagliflozin-Treated PatientsThe four placebo-controlled trials included one monotherapy trial and three add-on combination trials with metformin, metformin and sulfonylurea, or metformin and pioglitazone. Adverse Reaction Placebo N=646 Canagliflozin 100 mg N=833 Canagliflozin 300 mg N=834 Female genital mycotic infectionsFemale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: Vulvovaginal candidiasis, Vulvovaginal mycotic infection, Vulvovaginitis, Vaginal infection, Vulvitis, and Genital infection fungal. Percentages calculated with the number of female subjects in each group as denominator: placebo (N=312), canagliflozin 100 mg (N=425), and canagliflozin 300 mg (N=430). 3.2% 10.4% 11.4% Urinary tract infectionsUrinary tract infections include the following adverse reactions: Urinary tract infection, Cystitis, Kidney infection, and Urosepsis. 4.0% 5.9% 4.3% Increased urinationIncreased urination includes the following adverse reactions: Polyuria, Pollakiuria, Urine output increased, Micturition urgency, and Nocturia. 0.8% 5.3% 4.6% Male genital mycotic infectionsMale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: Balanitis or Balanoposthitis, Balanitis candida, and Genital infection fungal. Percentages calculated with the number of male subjects in each group as denominator: placebo (N=334), canagliflozin 100 mg (N=408), and canagliflozin 300 mg (N=404). 0.6% 4.2% 3.7% Vulvovaginal pruritus 0.0% 1.6% 3.0% ThirstThirst includes the following adverse reactions: Thirst, Dry mouth, and Polydipsia. 0.2% 2.8% 2.3% Constipation 0.9% 1.8% 2.3% Nausea 1.5% 2.2% 2.3% Abdominal pain was also more commonly reported in patients taking canagliflozin 100 mg (1.8%), 300 mg (1.7%) than in patients taking placebo (0.8%). Canagliflozin and Metformin The incidence and type of adverse reactions in the three 26-week placebo-controlled metformin add-on studies, representing a majority of data from the four 26-week placebo-controlled trials, was similar to the adverse reactions described in Table 1. There were no additional adverse reactions identified in the pooling of these three placebo-controlled studies that included metformin relative to the four placebo-controlled studies. Pool of Placebo- and Active-Controlled Trials - Canagliflozin The occurrence of adverse reactions for canagliflozin was evaluated in a larger pool of patients participating in placebo- and active-controlled trials. The data combined eight clinical trials and reflect exposure of 6177 patients to canagliflozin. The mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin was 38 weeks with 1832 individuals exposed to canagliflozin for greater than 50 weeks. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg (N=3092), canagliflozin 300 mg (N=3085) or comparator (N=3262) once daily. The mean age of the population was 60 years and 5% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population was male and 73% were Caucasian, 16% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 11 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 33% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 81 mL/min/1.73 m2). The types and frequency of common adverse reactions observed in the pool of eight clinical trials were consistent with those listed in Table 1. In this pool, canagliflozin was also associated with the adverse reactions of fatigue (1.7% with comparator, 2.2% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 2.0% with canagliflozin 300 mg) and loss of strength or energy (i.e., asthenia) (0.6% with comparator, 0.7% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.1% with canagliflozin 300 mg). In the pool of eight clinical trials, the incidence rate of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) was 0.9, 2.7, and 0.9 per 1000 patient-years of exposure to comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. In the pool of eight clinical trials, hypersensitivity-related adverse reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) occurred in 3.0%, 3.8%, and 4.2% of patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Five patients experienced serious adverse reactions of hypersensitivity with canagliflozin, which included 4 patients with urticaria and 1 patient with a diffuse rash and urticaria occurring within hours of exposure to canagliflozin. Among these patients, 2 patients discontinued canagliflozin. One patient with urticaria had recurrence when canagliflozin was re-initiated. Photosensitivity-related adverse reactions (including photosensitivity reaction, polymorphic light eruption, and sunburn) occurred in 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of patients receiving comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Other adverse reactions occurring more frequently on canagliflozin than on comparator were: Volume Depletion-Related Adverse Reactions Canagliflozin results in an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. In clinical studies, treatment with canagliflozin was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of volume depletion-related adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dehydration). An increased incidence was observed in patients on the 300 mg dose. The three factors associated with the largest increase in volume depletion-related adverse reactions were the use of loop diuretics, moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and age 75 years and older (Table 2) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Table 2: Proportion of Patients With at Least One Volume Depletion-Related Adverse Reaction (Pooled Results from 8 Clinical Trials) Baseline Characteristic Comparator GroupIncludes placebo and active-comparator groups % Canagliflozin 100 mg % Canagliflozin 300 mg % Overall population 1.5% 2.3% 3.4% 75 years of age and olderPatients could have more than 1 of the listed risk factors 2.6% 4.9% 8.7% eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 2.5% 4.7% 8.1% Use of loop diuretic 4.7% 3.2% 8.8% Falls In a pool of nine clinical trials with mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 85 weeks, the proportion of patients who experienced falls was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 2.1% with comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The higher risk of falls for patients treated with canagliflozin was observed within the first few weeks of treatment. Impairment in Renal Function Canagliflozin is associated with a dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and a concomitant fall in estimated GFR (Table 3). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes. Table 3: Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR Associated with Canagliflozin in the Pool of Four Placebo-Controlled Trials and Moderate Renal Impairment Trial Placebo N=646 Canagliflozin 100 mg N=833 Canagliflozin 300 mg N=834 Pool of Four Placebo-Controlled Trials Baseline Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.84 0.82 0.82 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 87.0 88.3 88.8 Week 6 Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.03 0.05 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.6 -3.8 -5.0 End of Treatment ChangeWeek 26 in mITT LOCF population Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.02 0.03 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.6 -2.3 -3.4 Placebo N=90 Canagliflozin 100 mg N=90 Canagliflozin 300 mg N=89 Moderate Renal Impairment Trial Baseline Creatinine (mg/dL) 1.61 1.62 1.63 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 40.1 39.7 38.5 Week 3 Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.03 0.18 0.28 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -0.7 -4.6 -6.2 End of Treatment Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.07 0.16 0.18 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.5 -3.6 -4.0 In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials where patients had normal or mildly impaired baseline renal function, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR below 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 30% lower than baseline, was 2.1% with placebo, 2.0% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 4.1% with canagliflozin 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 0.5% with placebo, 0.7% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.4% with canagliflozin 300 mg had a significant renal function decline. In a trial carried out in patients with moderate renal impairment with a baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean baseline eGFR 39 mL/min/1.73 m2), the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR 30% lower than baseline, was 6.9% with placebo, 18% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 22.5% with canagliflozin 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 4.6% with placebo, 3.4% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 2.2% with canagliflozin 300 mg had a significant renal function decline. In a pooled population of patients with moderate renal impairment (N=1085) with baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean baseline eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73 m2), the overall incidence of these events was lower than in the dedicated trial but a dose-dependent increase in incident episodes of significant renal function decline compared to placebo was still observed. Use of canagliflozin has been associated with an increased incidence of renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., increased blood creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal impairment, and acute renal failure), particularly in patients with moderate renal impairment. In the pooled analysis of patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 3.7% with placebo, 8.9% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 9.3% with canagliflozin 300 mg. Discontinuations due to renal-related adverse events occurred in 1.0% with placebo, 1.2% with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.6% with canagliflozin 300 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Genital Mycotic Infections In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvovaginitis) occurred in 3.2%, 10.4%, and 11.4% of females treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin. Female patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrence and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents. In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., candidal balanitis, balanoposthitis) occurred in 0.6%, 4.2%, and 3.7% of males treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males and in males with a prior history of balanitis or balanoposthitis. Male patients who developed genital mycotic infections on canagliflozin were more likely to experience recurrent infections (22% on canagliflozin versus none on placebo), and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents than patients on comparators. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo and canagliflozin, respectively. In the pooled analysis of 8 controlled trials, phimosis was reported in 0.3% of uncircumcised male patients treated with canagliflozin and 0.2% required circumcision to treat the phimosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Hypoglycemia In canagliflozin clinical trials, hypoglycemia was defined as any event regardless of symptoms, where biochemical hypoglycemia was documented (any glucose value below or equal to 70 mg/dL). Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event consistent with hypoglycemia where the patient required the assistance of another person to recover, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (regardless of whether biochemical documentation of a low glucose value was obtained). In individual clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.6)], episodes of hypoglycemia occurred at a higher rate when canagliflozin was co-administered with insulin or sulfonylureas (Table 4) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Table 4: Incidence of HypoglycemiaNumber of patients experiencing at least one event of hypoglycemia based on either biochemically documented episodes or severe hypoglycemic events in the intent-to-treat population in Controlled Clinical Studies Monotherapy (26 weeks) Placebo (N=192) Canagliflozin 100 mg (N=195) Canagliflozin 300 mg (N=197) Overall [N (%)] 5 (2.6) 7 (3.6) 6 (3.0) In Combination with Metformin (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin (N=183) Canagliflozin 100 mg + Metformin (N=368) Canagliflozin 300 mg + Metformin (N=367) Overall [N (%)] 3 (1.6) 16 (4.3) 17 (4.6) Severe [N (%)]Severe episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as those where the patient required the assistance of another person to recover, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (regardless of whether biochemical documentation of a low glucose value was obtained) 0 (0) 1 (0.3) 1 (0.3) In Combination with Metformin (18 weeks) Phase 2 clinical study with twice daily dosing (50 mg or 150 mg twice daily in combination with metformin) Placebo (N=93) Canagliflozin 100 mg (N=93) Canagliflozin 300 mg (N=93) Overall [N (%)] 3 (3.2) 4 (4.3) 3 (3.2) In Combination with Metformin + Sulfonylurea (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=156) Canagliflozin 100 mg + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=157) Canagliflozin 300 mg + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=156) Overall [N (%)] 24 (15.4) 43 (27.4) 47 (30.1) Severe [N (%)] 1 (0.6) 1 (0.6) 0 In Combination with Metformin + Pioglitazone (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=115) Canagliflozin 100 mg + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=113) Canagliflozin 300 mg + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=114) Overall [N (%)] 3 (2.6) 3 (2.7) 6 (5.3) In Combination with Insulin (18 weeks) Placebo (N=565) Canagliflozin 100 mg (N=566) Canagliflozin 300 mg (N=587) Overall [N (%)] 208 (36.8) 279 (49.3) 285 (48.6) Severe [N (%)] 14 (2.5) 10 (1.8) 16 (2.7) In Combination with Insulin and Metformin (18 weeks) Subgroup of patients (N=287) from insulin substudy on canagliflozin in combination with metformin and insulin (with or without other antiglycemic agents) Placebo (N=145) Canagliflozin 100 mg (N=139) Canagliflozin 300 mg (N=148) Overall [N (%)] 66 (45.5) 58 (41.7) 70 (47.3) Severe [N (%)] 4 (2.8) 1 (0.7) 3 (2.0) Bone Fracture The occurrence of bone fractures was evaluated in a pool of nine clinical trials with a mean duration of exposure to canagliflozin of 85 weeks. The incidence rates of adjudicated bone fractures were 1.1, 1.4, and 1.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the comparator, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg groups, respectively. Fractures were observed as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation and were more likely to be low trauma (e.g., fall from no more than standing height), and affect the upper extremities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Metformin The most common adverse reactions (5% or greater incidence) due to initiation of metformin are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache. Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12, which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., megaloblastic anemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Laboratory and Imaging Tests Increases in Serum Potassium In a pooled population of patients (N=723) with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), increases in serum potassium to greater than 5.4 mEq/L and 15% above baseline occurred in 5.3%, 5.0%, and 8.8% of patients treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Severe elevations (greater than or equal to 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, no patients treated with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 1.3% of patients treated with canagliflozin 300 mg. In these patients, increases in potassium were more commonly seen in those with elevated potassium at baseline. Among patients with moderate renal impairment, approximately 84% were taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Increases in Serum Magnesium Dose-related increases in serum magnesium were observed early after initiation of canagliflozin (within 6 weeks) and remained elevated throughout treatment. In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum magnesium levels was 8.1% and 9.3% with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, compared to -0.6% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, serum magnesium levels increased by 0.2%, 9.2%, and 14.8% with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Increases in Serum Phosphate Dose-related increases in serum phosphate levels were observed with canagliflozin. In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum phosphate levels were 3.6% and 5.1% with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, compared to 1.5% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, the mean serum phosphate levels increased by 1.2%, 5.0%, and 9.3% with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (non-HDL-C) In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C with canagliflozin were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in LDL-C relative to placebo were 4.4 mg/dL (4.5%) and 8.2 mg/dL (8.0%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 104 to 110 mg/dL across treatment groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Dose-related increases in non-HDL-C with canagliflozin were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in non-HDL-C relative to placebo were 2.1 mg/dL (1.5%) and 5.1 mg/dL (3.6%) with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline non-HDL-C levels were 140 to 147 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increases in Hemoglobin In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in hemoglobin were -0.18 g/dL (-1.1%) with placebo, 0.47 g/dL (3.5%) with canagliflozin 100 mg, and 0.51 g/dL (3.8%) with canagliflozin 300 mg. The mean baseline hemoglobin value was approximately 14.1 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.8%, 4.0%, and 2.7% of patients treated with placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg, respectively, had hemoglobin levels above the upper limit of normal. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a clinical trial of 714 older adults (mean age 64 years). At 2 years, patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg had placebo-corrected declines in BMD at the total hip of 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, and at the lumbar spine of 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Additionally, placebo-adjusted BMD declines were 0.1% at the femoral neck for both canagliflozin doses and 0.4% at the distal forearm for patients randomized to canagliflozin 300 mg. The placebo-adjusted change at the distal forearm for patients randomized to canagliflozin 100 mg was 0%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of canagliflozin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis: Warn against excessive alcohol use. INVOKAMET is not recommended in hepatic impairment or hypoxic states. Ensure normal renal function before initiating and at least annually thereafter (5.1, 5.4, 5.7, 5.13, 5.14) Hypotension: Before initiating INVOKAMET, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, or on diuretics, ACEi, or ARB. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy (5.2) Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating INVOKAMET, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on INVOKAMET may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (5.3) Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy (5.4) Radiological studies and surgical procedures: Temporarily discontinue for radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids (5.4) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia (2.2, 5.5, 6.1, 8.6) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (5.6) Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKAMET (5.8) Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat if indicated (5.9) Hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue INVOKAMET and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve (5.10) Bone fracture: Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk before initiating INVOKAMET (5.11) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Monitor hematologic parameters annually (5.12) Increased LDL-C: Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate (5.15) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with INVOKAMET and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels greater than 5 mcg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patients unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.7, 5.13, 5.14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. More severe acidosis may be associated with signs such as hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Patients should be educated to recognize and promptly report these symptoms. If present, INVOKAMET should be discontinued until lactic acidosis is ruled out. Gastrointestinal symptoms in patients on a chronic, stable dose of metformin could be caused by lactic acidosis or other serious disease. To rule out lactic acidosis, serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be due to other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Metformin is dialyzable (clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions) and prompt hemodialysis is recommended to remove the accumulated metformin and correct the metabolic acidosis. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Hypotension Canagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating INVOKAMET [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] particularly in patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, elderly patients, patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or patients with low systolic blood pressure. Before initiating INVOKAMET in patients with one or more of these characteristics who were not already on canagliflozin, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy. 5.3 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including canagliflozin. INVOKAMET is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients treated with INVOKAMET who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with INVOKAMET may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, INVOKAMET should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement. In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified. Before initiating INVOKAMET consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with INVOKAMET consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing INVOKAMET in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). 5.4 Impairment in Renal Function Canagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating INVOKAMET [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Therefore, INVOKAMET is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Before initiation of INVOKAMET therapy and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients in whom development of renal impairment is anticipated (e.g., elderly), assess renal function more frequently and discontinue INVOKAMET if evidence of renal impairment is present (e.g. serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL for males or 1.4 mg/dL for females, or eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Use of Concomitant Medications That May Affect Renal Function or Metformin Disposition Monitor and adjust dose of INVOKAMET or concomitant drug in patients taking medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in a significant hemodynamic change or interfere with the disposition of metformin [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Radiological Studies and Surgical Procedures Radiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (e.g., intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and computed tomography) can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, temporarily discontinue INVOKAMET at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withhold for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstitute only after renal function has been confirmed to be normal. Temporarily discontinue INVOKAMET for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and restart after the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Canagliflozin can lead to hyperkalemia. Patients with moderate renal impairment who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKAMET in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia due to medications or other medical conditions. 5.6 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.7 Impaired Hepatic Function Metformin use in patients with impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Therefore, INVOKAMET is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.8 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Sulfonylurea or Insulin Canagliflozin Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Canagliflozin can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKAMET. Metformin Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication, are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Monitor for a need to lower the dose of INVOKAMET to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients. 5.9 Genital Mycotic Infections Canagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately. 5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported with canagliflozin. These reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating canagliflozin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of INVOKAMET; treat and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.11 Bone Fracture An increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, was observed in patients using canagliflozin. Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating INVOKAMET [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.12 Vitamin B12 Levels In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decreases, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia or neurologic manifestations due to the short duration (less than 1 year) of the clinical trials. This risk may be more relevant to patients receiving long-term treatment with metformin and adverse hematologic and neurologic reactions have been reported postmarketing. The decrease in vitamin B12 levels appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis in patients on INVOKAMET and investigate and treat if abnormalities occur. Patients with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption may be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels, and routine serum vitamin B12 measurement at 2- to 3-year intervals is recommended in these patients. 5.13 Alcohol Intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving INVOKAMET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.14 Hypoxic States Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause (e.g., acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia) have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, promptly discontinue INVOKAMET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.15 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C) Dose-related increases in LDL-C occur with canagliflozin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate after initiating INVOKAMET. 5.16 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with INVOKAMET or any other antidiabetic drug [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."$$

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS UGT inducers (e.g., rifampin): Canagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider increasing dose from 100 mg to 300 mg (2.3, 7.1) Digoxin: Monitor digoxin levels (7.2) 7.1 UGT Enzyme Inducers Rifampin: Co-administration of canagliflozin with rifampin, a nonselective inducer of several UGT enzymes, including UGT1A9, UGT2B4, decreased canagliflozin area under the curve (AUC) by 51%. This decrease in exposure to canagliflozin may decrease efficacy. If an inducer of these UGTs (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) must be co-administered with INVOKANA (canagliflozin), consider increasing the dose to 300 mg once daily if patients are currently tolerating INVOKANA 100 mg once daily, have an eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and require additional glycemic control. Consider other antihyperglycemic therapy in patients with an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving concurrent therapy with a UGT inducer and require additional glycemic control [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Digoxin There was an increase in the AUC and mean peak drug concentration (Cmax) of digoxin (20% and 36%, respectively) when co-administered with INVOKANA 300 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients taking INVOKANA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately. 7.3 Positive Urine Glucose Test Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. 7.4 Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control."$$

Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials The data in Table 1 is derived from four 26-week placebo-controlled trials. In one trial INVOKANA was used as monotherapy and in three trials INVOKANA was used as add-on therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These data reflect exposure of 1667 patients to INVOKANA and a mean duration of exposure to INVOKANA of 24 weeks. Patients received INVOKANA 100 mg (N=833), INVOKANA 300 mg (N=834) or placebo (N=646) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population was male and 72% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian, and 5% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.3 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 20% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 88 mL/min/1.73 m2). Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of INVOKANA. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on INVOKANA than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either INVOKANA 100 mg or INVOKANA 300 mg. Table 1: Adverse Reactions From Pool of Four 26-Week Placebo-Controlled Studies Reported in >= 2% of INVOKANA-Treated PatientsThe four placebo-controlled trials included one monotherapy trial and three add-on combination trials with metformin, metformin and sulfonylurea, or metformin and pioglitazone. Adverse Reaction Placebo N=646 INVOKANA 100 mg N=833 INVOKANA 300 mg N=834 Female genital mycotic infectionsFemale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: Vulvovaginal candidiasis, Vulvovaginal mycotic infection, Vulvovaginitis, Vaginal infection, Vulvitis, and Genital infection fungal. Percentages calculated with the number of female subjects in each group as denominator: placebo (N=312), INVOKANA 100 mg (N=425), and INVOKANA 300 mg (N=430). 3.2% 10.4% 11.4% Urinary tract infectionsUrinary tract infections include the following adverse reactions: Urinary tract infection, Cystitis, Kidney infection, and Urosepsis. 4.0% 5.9% 4.3% Increased urinationIncreased urination includes the following adverse reactions: Polyuria, Pollakiuria, Urine output increased, Micturition urgency, and Nocturia. 0.8% 5.3% 4.6% Male genital mycotic infectionsMale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions: Balanitis or Balanoposthitis, Balanitis candida, and Genital infection fungal. Percentages calculated with the number of male subjects in each group as denominator: placebo (N=334), INVOKANA 100 mg (N=408), and INVOKANA 300 mg (N=404). 0.6% 4.2% 3.7% Vulvovaginal pruritus 0.0% 1.6% 3.0% ThirstThirst includes the following adverse reactions: Thirst, Dry mouth, and Polydipsia. 0.2% 2.8% 2.3% Constipation 0.9% 1.8% 2.3% Nausea 1.5% 2.2% 2.3% Abdominal pain was also more commonly reported in patients taking INVOKANA 100 mg (1.8%), 300 mg (1.7%) than in patients taking placebo (0.8%). Pool of Placebo- and Active-Controlled Trials The occurrence of adverse reactions for canagliflozin was evaluated in a larger pool of patients participating in placebo- and active-controlled trials. The data combined eight clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] and reflect exposure of 6177 patients to INVOKANA. The mean duration of exposure to INVOKANA was 38 weeks with 1832 individuals exposed to INVOKANA for greater than 50 weeks. Patients received INVOKANA 100 mg (N=3092), INVOKANA 300 mg (N=3085) or comparator (N=3262) once daily. The mean age of the population was 60 years and 5% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population was male and 73% were Caucasian, 16% were Asian, and 4% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 11 years, had a mean HbA1C of 8.0% and 33% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired (mean eGFR 81 mL/min/1.73 m2). The types and frequency of common adverse reactions observed in the pool of eight clinical trials were consistent with those listed in Table 1. In this pool, INVOKANA was also associated with the adverse reactions of fatigue (1.7% with comparator, 2.2% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 2.0% with INVOKANA 300 mg) and loss of strength or energy (i.e., asthenia) (0.6% with comparator, 0.7% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 1.1% with INVOKANA 300 mg). In the pool of eight clinical trials, the incidence rate of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) was 0.9, 2.7, and 0.9 per 1000 patient-years of exposure to comparator, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. In the pool of eight clinical trials, hypersensitivity-related adverse reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) occurred in 3.0%, 3.8%, and 4.2% of patients receiving comparator, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Five patients experienced serious adverse reactions of hypersensitivity with INVOKANA, which included 4 patients with urticaria and 1 patient with a diffuse rash and urticaria occurring within hours of exposure to INVOKANA. Among these patients, 2 patients discontinued INVOKANA. One patient with urticaria had recurrence when INVOKANA was re-initiated. Photosensitivity-related adverse reactions (including photosensitivity reaction, polymorphic light eruption, and sunburn) occurred in 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.2% of patients receiving comparator, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Other adverse reactions occurring more frequently on INVOKANA than on comparator were: Volume Depletion-Related Adverse Reactions INVOKANA results in an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to reductions in intravascular volume. In clinical studies, treatment with INVOKANA was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of volume depletion-related adverse reactions (e.g., hypotension, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and dehydration). An increased incidence was observed in patients on the 300 mg dose. The three factors associated with the largest increase in volume depletion-related adverse reactions were the use of loop diuretics, moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and age 75 years and older (Table 2) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 and 8.6)]. Table 2: Proportion of Patients With at Least One Volume Depletion-Related Adverse Reaction (Pooled Results from 8 Clinical Trials) Baseline Characteristic Comparator GroupIncludes placebo and active-comparator groups % INVOKANA 100 mg % INVOKANA 300 mg % Overall population 1.5% 2.3% 3.4% 75 years of age and olderPatients could have more than 1 of the listed risk factors 2.6% 4.9% 8.7% eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 2.5% 4.7% 8.1% Use of loop diuretic 4.7% 3.2% 8.8% Falls In a pool of nine clinical trials with mean duration of exposure to INVOKANA of 85 weeks, the proportion of patients who experienced falls was 1.3%, 1.5%, and 2.1% with comparator, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. The higher risk of falls for patients treated with INVOKANA was observed within the first few weeks of treatment. Impairment in Renal Function INVOKANA is associated with a dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and a concomitant fall in estimated GFR (Table 3). Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes. Table 3: Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR Associated with INVOKANA in the Pool of Four Placebo-Controlled Trials and Moderate Renal Impairment Trial Placebo N=646 INVOKANA 100 mg N=833 INVOKANA 300 mg N=834 Pool of Four Placebo-Controlled Trials Baseline Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.84 0.82 0.82 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 87.0 88.3 88.8 Week 6 Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.03 0.05 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.6 -3.8 -5.0 End of Treatment ChangeWeek 26 in mITT LOCF population Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.01 0.02 0.03 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.6 -2.3 -3.4 Placebo N=90 INVOKANA 100 mg N=90 INVOKANA 300 mg N=89 Moderate Renal Impairment Trial Baseline Creatinine (mg/dL) 1.61 1.62 1.63 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 40.1 39.7 38.5 Week 3 Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.03 0.18 0.28 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -0.7 -4.6 -6.2 End of Treatment Change Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.07 0.16 0.18 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) -1.5 -3.6 -4.0 In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials where patients had normal or mildly impaired baseline renal function, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR below 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 30% lower than baseline, was 2.1% with placebo, 2.0% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 4.1% with INVOKANA 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 0.5% with placebo, 0.7% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 1.4% with INVOKANA 300 mg had a significant renal function decline. In a trial carried out in patients with moderate renal impairment with a baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean baseline eGFR 39 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], the proportion of patients who experienced at least one event of significant renal function decline, defined as an eGFR 30% lower than baseline, was 6.9% with placebo, 18% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 22.5% with INVOKANA 300 mg. At the end of treatment, 4.6% with placebo, 3.4% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 2.2% with INVOKANA 300 mg had a significant renal function decline. In a pooled population of patients with moderate renal impairment (N=1085) with baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean baseline eGFR 48 mL/min/1.73 m2), the overall incidence of these events was lower than in the dedicated trial but a dose-dependent increase in incident episodes of significant renal function decline compared to placebo was still observed. Use of INVOKANA has been associated with an increased incidence of renal-related adverse reactions (e.g., increased blood creatinine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal impairment, and acute renal failure), particularly in patients with moderate renal impairment. In the pooled analysis of patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal-related adverse reactions was 3.7% with placebo, 8.9% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 9.3% with INVOKANA 300 mg. Discontinuations due to renal-related adverse events occurred in 1.0% with placebo, 1.2% with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 1.6% with INVOKANA 300 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Genital Mycotic Infections In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, female genital mycotic infections (e.g., vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and vulvovaginitis) occurred in 3.2%, 10.4%, and 11.4% of females treated with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections on INVOKANA. Female patients who developed genital mycotic infections on INVOKANA were more likely to experience recurrence and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents. In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo and INVOKANA, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. In the pool of four placebo-controlled clinical trials, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., candidal balanitis, balanoposthitis) occurred in 0.6%, 4.2%, and 3.7% of males treated with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males and in males with a prior history of balanitis or balanoposthitis. Male patients who developed genital mycotic infections on INVOKANA were more likely to experience recurrent infections (22% on INVOKANA versus none on placebo), and require treatment with oral or topical antifungal agents and anti-microbial agents than patients on comparators. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo and INVOKANA, respectively. In the pooled analysis of 8 controlled trials, phimosis was reported in 0.3% of uncircumcised male patients treated with INVOKANA and 0.2% required circumcision to treat the phimosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Hypoglycemia In all clinical trials, hypoglycemia was defined as any event regardless of symptoms, where biochemical hypoglycemia was documented (any glucose value below or equal to 70 mg/dL). Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event consistent with hypoglycemia where the patient required the assistance of another person to recover, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (regardless of whether biochemical documentation of a low glucose value was obtained). In individual clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], episodes of hypoglycemia occurred at a higher rate when INVOKANA was co-administered with insulin or sulfonylureas (Table 4) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Table 4: Incidence of HypoglycemiaNumber of patients experiencing at least one event of hypoglycemia based on either biochemically documented episodes or severe hypoglycemic events in the intent-to-treat population in Controlled Clinical Studies Monotherapy (26 weeks) Placebo (N=192) INVOKANA 100 mg (N=195) INVOKANA 300 mg (N=197) Overall [N (%)] 5 (2.6) 7 (3.6) 6 (3.0) In Combination with Metformin (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin (N=183) INVOKANA 100 mg + Metformin (N=368) INVOKANA 300 mg + Metformin (N=367) Overall [N (%)] 3 (1.6) 16 (4.3) 17 (4.6) Severe [N (%)]Severe episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as those where the patient required the assistance of another person to recover, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (regardless of whether biochemical documentation of a low glucose value was obtained) 0 (0) 1 (0.3) 1 (0.3) In Combination with Metformin (52 weeks) Glimepiride + Metformin (N=482) INVOKANA 100 mg + Metformin (N=483) INVOKANA 300 mg + Metformin (N=485) Overall [N (%)] 165 (34.2) 27 (5.6) 24 (4.9) Severe [N (%)] 15 (3.1) 2 (0.4) 3 (0.6) In Combination with Sulfonylurea (18 weeks) Placebo + Sulfonylurea (N=69) INVOKANA 100 mg + Sulfonylurea (N=74) INVOKANA 300 mg + Sulfonylurea (N=72) Overall [N (%)] 4 (5.8) 3 (4.1) 9 (12.5) In Combination with Metformin + Sulfonylurea (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=156) INVOKANA 100 mg + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=157) INVOKANA 300 mg + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=156) Overall [N (%)] 24 (15.4) 43 (27.4) 47 (30.1) Severe [N (%)] 1 (0.6) 1 (0.6) 0 In Combination with Metformin + Sulfonylurea (52 weeks) Sitagliptin + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=378) INVOKANA 300 mg + Metformin + Sulfonylurea (N=377) Overall [N (%)] 154 (40.7) 163 (43.2) Severe [N (%)] 13 (3.4) 15 (4.0) In Combination with Metformin + Pioglitazone (26 weeks) Placebo + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=115) INVOKANA 100 mg + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=113) INVOKANA 300 mg + Metformin + Pioglitazone (N=114) Overall [N (%)] 3 (2.6) 3 (2.7) 6 (5.3) In Combination with Insulin (18 weeks) Placebo (N=565) INVOKANA 100 mg (N=566) INVOKANA 300 mg (N=587) Overall [N (%)] 208 (36.8) 279 (49.3) 285 (48.6) Severe [N (%)] 14 (2.5) 10 (1.8) 16 (2.7) Bone Fracture The occurrence of bone fractures was evaluated in a pool of nine clinical trials with a mean duration of exposure to INVOKANA of 85 weeks. The incidence rates of adjudicated bone fractures were 1.1, 1.4, and 1.5 per 100 patient-years of exposure in the comparator, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg groups, respectively. Fractures were observed as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation and were more likely to be low trauma (e.g., fall from no more than standing height), and affect the upper extremities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Laboratory and Imaging Tests Increases in Serum Potassium In a pooled population of patients (N=723) with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), increases in serum potassium to greater than 5.4 mEq/L and 15% above baseline occurred in 5.3%, 5.0%, and 8.8% of patients treated with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Severe elevations (greater than or equal to 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, no patients treated with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 1.3% of patients treated with INVOKANA 300 mg. In these patients, increases in potassium were more commonly seen in those with elevated potassium at baseline. Among patients with moderate renal impairment, approximately 84% were taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and 5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Increases in Serum Magnesium Dose-related increases in serum magnesium were observed early after initiation of INVOKANA (within 6 weeks) and remained elevated throughout treatment. In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum magnesium levels was 8.1% and 9.3% with INVOKANA 100 mg and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively, compared to -0.6% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], serum magnesium levels increased by 0.2%, 9.2%, and 14.8% with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Increases in Serum Phosphate Dose-related increases in serum phosphate levels were observed with INVOKANA. In the pool of four placebo controlled trials, the mean percent change in serum phosphate levels were 3.6% and 5.1% with INVOKANA 100 mg and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively, compared to 1.5% with placebo. In a trial of patients with moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], the mean serum phosphate levels increased by 1.2%, 5.0%, and 9.3% with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (non-HDL-C) In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C with INVOKANA were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in LDL-C relative to placebo were 4.4 mg/dL (4.5%) and 8.2 mg/dL (8.0%) with INVOKANA 100 mg and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline LDL-C levels were 104 to 110 mg/dL across treatment groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Dose-related increases in non-HDL-C with INVOKANA were observed. Mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in non-HDL-C relative to placebo were 2.1 mg/dL (1.5%) and 5.1 mg/dL (3.6%) with INVOKANA 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. The mean baseline non-HDL-C levels were 140 to 147 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increases in Hemoglobin In the pool of four placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in hemoglobin were -0.18 g/dL (-1.1%) with placebo, 0.47 g/dL (3.5%) with INVOKANA 100 mg, and 0.51 g/dL (3.8%) with INVOKANA 300 mg. The mean baseline hemoglobin value was approximately 14.1 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.8%, 4.0%, and 2.7% of patients treated with placebo, INVOKANA 100 mg, and INVOKANA 300 mg, respectively, had hemoglobin above the upper limit of normal. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a clinical trial of 714 older adults (mean age 64 years) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. At 2 years, patients randomized to INVOKANA 100 mg and INVOKANA 300 mg had placebo-corrected declines in BMD at the total hip of 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, and at the lumbar spine of 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Additionally, placebo-adjusted BMD declines were 0.1% at the femoral neck for both INVOKANA doses and 0.4% at the distal forearm for patients randomized to INVOKANA 300 mg. The placebo-adjusted change at the distal forearm for patients randomized to INVOKANA 100 mg was 0%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of INVOKANA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Anaphylaxis, Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"$$

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Before initiating INVOKANA, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, or if on diuretics, ACEi, or ARB. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy (5.1) Ketoacidosis: Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue INVOKANA, evaluate and treat promptly. Before initiating INVOKANA, consider risk factors for ketoacidosis. Patients on INVOKANA may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (5.2) Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5.3) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia (2.2, 5.4, 6.1, 8.6) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated (5.5) Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA (5.6) Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat if indicated (5.7) Hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue INVOKANA and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve (5.8) Bone fracture: Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk before initiating INVOKANA (5.9) Increased LDL-C: Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate (5.10) 5.1 Hypotension INVOKANA causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or patients with low systolic blood pressure. Before initiating INVOKANA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy. 5.2 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis, a serious life-threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including INVOKANA. INVOKANA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Patients treated with INVOKANA who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels, as ketoacidosis associated with INVOKANA may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg/dL. If ketoacidosis is suspected, INVOKANA should be discontinued, patient should be evaluated, and prompt treatment should be instituted. Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin, fluid and carbohydrate replacement. In many of the postmarketing reports, and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (often less than 250 mg/dL). Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. In some but not all cases, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery, pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency (e.g., type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were identified. Before initiating INVOKANA, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause, caloric restriction, and alcohol abuse. In patients treated with INVOKANA consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing INVOKANA in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). 5.3 Impairment in Renal Function INVOKANA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 5.4 Hyperkalemia INVOKANA can lead to hyperkalemia. Patients with moderate renal impairment who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKANA in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia due to medications or other medical conditions. 5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including INVOKANA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKANA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA. 5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections INVOKANA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported with INVOKANA. These reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating INVOKANA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of INVOKANA; treat and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5.9 Bone Fracture An increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, was observed in patients using INVOKANA. Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating INVOKANA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C) Dose-related increases in LDL-C occur with INVOKANA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate after initiating INVOKANA. 5.11 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with INVOKANA or any other antidiabetic drug."$$
