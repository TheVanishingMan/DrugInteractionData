"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Pigmentation: pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes can occur. Iris pigmentation likely to be permanent. (5.1) -Eyelash Changes: gradual change to eyelashes including increased length, thickness and number of lashes. Usually reversible. (5.2) 5.1 Pigmentation Latanoprost has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of latanoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. Beyond 5 years the effects of increased pigmentation are not known [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )]. Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with latanoprost can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Eyelash Changes Latanoprost may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye; these changes include increased length, thickness, pigmentation, the number of lashes or hairs, and misdirected growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.3 Intraocular Inflammation Latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation because inflammation may be exacerbated. 5.4 Macular Edema Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with latanoprost. Latanoprost ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema. 5.5 Herpetic Keratitis Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported during treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic solution. Latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis. Latanoprost should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis because inflammation may be exacerbated. 5.6 Bacterial Keratitis There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.7 Use with Contact Lenses Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration."$$

The events, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to Latanoprost Ophthalmic Solution, or a combination of these factors, include: asthma and exacerbation of asthma; corneal edema and erosions; dyspnea; eyelash and vellus hair changes (increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and number); eyelid skin darkening; herpes keratitis; intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis); keratitis; macular edema, including cystoid macular edema; misdirected eyelashes sometimes resulting in eye irritation; dizziness, headache, and toxic epidermal necrolysis."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Events Referred to in Other Sections of this Insert Eyelash changes (increased length, thickness, pigmentation and number of lashes); eyelid skin darkening; intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis); iris pigmentation changes; and macular edema, including cystoid macular edema (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Controlled Clinical Trials The ocular adverse events and ocular signs and symptoms reported in 5% to 15% of the patients on latanoprost ophthalmic solution in the three 6-month, multicenter, double-masked, active-controlled trials were blurred vision, burning and stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, foreign body sensation, itching, increased pigmentation of the iris and punctuate epithelial keratopathy. Local conjunctival hyperemia was observed; however, less than 1% of the patients treated with latanoprost required discontinuation of therapy because of intolerance to conjunctival hyperemia. In addition to the above listed ocular events/signs and symptoms, the following were reported in 1% to 4% of the patients: dry eye, excessive tearing, eye pain, lid crusting, lid discomfort/pain, lid edema, lid erythema and photophobia. The following events were reported in less than 1% of the patients: conjunctivitis, diplopia and discharge from the eye. During clinical studies, there were extremely rare reports of the following: retinal artery embolus, retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage from diabetic retinopathy. The most common systemic adverse events seen with latanoprost were upper respiratory tract infection/cold/flu, which occurred at a rate of approximately 4%. Chest pain/angina pectoris, muscle/joint/back pain and rash/allergic skin reaction each occurred at a rate of 1% to 2%.
