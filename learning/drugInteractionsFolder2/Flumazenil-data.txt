"ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious Adverse Reactions Deaths have occurred in npatients who received flumazenil in a variety of clinical settings. The majority of deaths occurred in patients with serious underlying idsease or in patients who had ingested large amounts of non-benzodiazepine drugs *usually cyclic antidepressants), as part of an overdose. Serious adverse events have occurred in all clinical settings, and convulsions are the most common serious adverse events reported. Flumazenil administration has been associated with the onset of convulsions in patients with sever hepatic impairment and in patients who are relying on benzodiazepine effects to control seizures, are physically dependent on benzodiazepins, or who have ingested large doses of other drugs (mixed-drug overdose) (see WARNINGS ). Two of the 446 patients who received flumazenil in controlled clinical trials for the management of a benzodiazepine overdose had cardiac dysrhythmias (1 ventricular tachycardia, 1 junctional tachycardia). Adverse Events in Clinical Studies The following adverse reactions were considered to be related to flumazenil administration (both alone and for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects) and were reported in studies involving 1875 individuals who received flumazenil in controlled trials. Adverse events most frequently associated with flumazenil alone were limited to dizziness, injection site pain, increased sweating, heatache, and abnormal or blurred vision (3% to 9%). Body as a Whole: fatigue (asthenia, amlaise), headache, injection site pain*, injection site reaction (thrombophlebitis, skin abnormality, rash) Cardiovascular System: cutaneous vasodilation (sweating, flushing, hot flushes) Digestive System: nausea, vomiting (11%) Nervous System: agitation (anxiety, nervousness, dry mouth, tremor, palpitations, insomnia, dyspnea, hyperventilation)*, dizziness (vertigo, ataxia) (10%), emotional lability (crying abnormal, depersonalization, euphoria, increased tears, depression, dysphoria, paranoia) Special Senses: abnormal vision (visual field defect, diplopia), paresthesia (sensation abnormal, hypoesthesia) All adverse reactions occurred in 1% to 3% of cases unless otherwise marked. *indicates reaction in 3% to 9% of cases. Obeserved percentage reported if greater than 9%. The following adverse events were observed infrequently (less than 1%) in the clinical studies, but were judged as probably related to flumazenil administration and/or reversal of benzodiazepine effects: Nervous System: confusion (difficulty concentrating, delirium), convulsions (see WARNINGS ), somnolence (stupor) Special Senses: abnormal hearing (transient hearing impairment, hyperacusis, tinnitus) The following adverse events occurred with frequencies less than 1% in the clinical trials. There relationship to flumazenil administration is unknown, but they are included as alerting information for the physician. Body as a Whole: rigors, shivering Cardiovascular System: arrhythmia (atrial, nodal, ventricular extrasystoles), bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain Digestive System: hiccup Nervous System: speech disorder (dysphonia, thick tongue) Not included in this list is operative site pain that occurred with the same frequency in patients receiving placebo as in patients receiving flumazenil for reversal of sedation following a surgical procedure. Additional Adverse Reactions Reported During Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported during postapproval use of flumazenil. Nervous System: Fear, panic attacks in patients with a history of panic disorders. Withdrawal sympotoms may occur following rapid injection of flumazenil in patients with long-term exposure to benzodiazepines.

Body as a Whole: fatigue (asthenia, malaise), headache, injection site pain*, injection site reaction (thrombophlebitis, skin abnormality, rash) Cardiovascular System: cutaneous vasodilation (sweating, flushing, hot flushes) Digestive System: nausea, vomiting (11%) Nervous System: agitation (anxiety, nervousness, dry mouth, tremor, palpitations, insomnia, dyspnea, hyperventilation)*, dizziness (vertigo, ataxia) (10%), emotional lability (crying abnormal, depersonalization, euphoria, increased tears, depression, dysphoria, paranoia) Special Senses: abnormal vision (visual field defect, diplopia), paresthesia (sensation abnormal,hypoesthesia) All adverse reactions occurred in 1% to 3% of cases unless otherwise marked. *indicates reaction in 3% to 9% of cases. Observed percentage reported if greater than 9%. The following adverse events were observed infrequently (less than 1%) in the clinical studies, but were judged as probably related to flumazenil administration and/or reversal of benzodiazepine effects: Nervous System: confusion (difficulty concentrating, delirium), convulsions (see WARNINGS), somnolence (stupor) Special Senses: abnormal hearing (transient hearing impairment, hyperacusis, tinnitus) The following adverse events occurred with frequencies less than 1% in the clinical trials. Their relationship to flumazenil administration is unknown, but they are included as alerting information for the physician. Body as a Whole: rigors, shivering Cardiovascular System: arrhythmia (atrial, nodal, ventricular extrasystoles), bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain Digestive System: hiccup Nervous System: speech disorder (dysphonia, thick tongue) Not included in this list is operative site pain that occurred with the same frequency in patients receiving placebo as in patients receiving flumazenil for reversal of sedation following a surgical procedure. Additional Adverse Reactions Reported During Postmarketing ExperienceThe following events have been reported during postapproval use of flumazenil. Nervous System: Fear, panic attacks in patients with a history of panic disorders. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following rapid injection of flumazenil in patients with long-term exposure to benzodiazepines. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Flumazenil acts as a benzodiazepine antagonist, blocks the effects of benzodiazepines in animals and man, antagonizes benzodiazepine reinforcement in animal models, produces dysphoria in normal subjects, and has had no reported abuse in foreign marketing. Although flumazenil has a benzodiazepine-like structure it does not act as a benzodiazepine agonist in man and is not a controlled substance."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious Adverse Reactions Deaths have occurred in patients who received flumazenil in a variety of clinical settings. The majority of deaths occurred in patients with serious underlying disease or in patients who had ingested large amounts of non-benzodiazepine drugs (usually cyclic antidepressants), as part of an overdose. Serious adverse events have occurred in all clinical settings, and convulsions are the most common serious adverse events reported. Flumazenil administration has been associated with the onset of convulsions in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in patients who are relying on benzodiazepine effects to control seizures, are physically dependent on benzodiazepines, or who have ingested large doses of other drugs (mixed-drug overdose) (see WARNINGS ). Two of the 446 patients who received flumazenil in controlled clinical trials for the management of a benzodiazepine overdose had cardiac dysrhythmias (1 ventricular tachycardia, 1 junctional tachycardia).

"Drug-Drug Interaction The pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil is unaltered in the presence of benzodiazepine agonists and the kinetic profiles of those benzodiazepines studied (i.e., diazepam, flunitrazepam, lormetazepam, and midazolam) are unaltered by flumazenil. During the 4-hour steady-state and post infusion of ethanol, there were no pharmacokinetic interactions on ethanol mean plasma levels as compared to placebo when flumazenil doses were given intravenously (at 2.5 hours and 6 hours) nor were interactions of ethanol on the flumazenil elimination half-life found.",$$
"Drug Interactions Interaction with central nervous system depressants other than benzodiazepines has not been specifically studied; however, no deleterious interactions were seen when flumazenil was administered after narcotics, inhalational anesthetics, muscle relaxants and muscle relaxant antagonists administered in conjunction with sedation or anesthesia. Particular caution is necessary when using flumazenil in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (especially cyclic antidepressants) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effect by flumazenil (see WARNINGS ). The use of flumazenil is not recommended in epileptic patients who have been receiving benzodiazepine treatment for a prolonged period. Although flumazenil exerts a slight intrinsic anticonvulsant effect, its abrupt suppression of the protective effect of a benzodiazepine agonist can give rise to convulsions in epileptic patients. Flumazenil blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines by competitive interaction at the receptor level. The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as zopiclone, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by flumazenil. The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines are unaltered in the presence of flumazenil and vice versa. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between ethanol and flumazenil."$$
