"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression \\342\\200\\224 monitor Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and platelet count prior to dosing and throughout treatment. Geriatric patients and women have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression. (5.1) Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed. (5.2) Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) - PCP prophylaxis required for all patients receiving concomitant TEMODAR and radiotherapy for the 42-day regimen for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (5.3) All patients, particularly those receiving steroids, should be observed closely for the development of lymphopenia and PCP. (5.4) Complete blood counts should be obtained throughout the treatment course as specified. (5.4) Hepatotoxicity - fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported. Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of TEMODAR. (5.5) Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when receiving TEMODAR. (5.6) As bioequivalence has been established only when given over 90 minutes, infusion over a shorter or longer period of time may result in suboptimal dosing; the possibility of an increase in infusion-related adverse reactions cannot be ruled out. (5.7) 5.1 Myelosuppression Patients treated with TEMODAR may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which may result in aplastic anemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, exposure to concomitant medications associated with aplastic anemia, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100 \\303\\227 109/L. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and platelet count exceeds 100 \\303\\227 109/L. Geriatric patients and women have been shown in clinical trials to have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression. 5.2 Myelodysplastic Syndrome Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed. 5.3 Pneumocystis Pneumonia For treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is required for all patients receiving concomitant TEMODAR and radiotherapy for the 42-day regimen. There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when temozolomide is administered during a longer dosing regimen. However, all patients receiving temozolomide, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely for the development of PCP regardless of the regimen. 5.4 Laboratory Tests For the concomitant treatment phase with RT, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and weekly during treatment. For the 28-day treatment cycles, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to treatment on Day 1 and on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) of each cycle. Blood counts should be performed weekly until recovery if the ANC falls below 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and the platelet count falls below 100 \\303\\227 109/L [see Recommended Dosing and Dose Modification Guidelines (2.1)]. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving TEMODAR. Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of TEMODAR. 5.6 Use in Pregnancy TEMODAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of TEMODAR to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 0.38 and 0.75 times the maximum recommended human dose (75 and 150 mg/m2), respectively, caused numerous fetal malformations of the external organs, soft tissues, and skeleton in both species [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Infusion Time As bioequivalence has been established only when TEMODAR for Injection was given over 90 minutes, infusion over a shorter or longer period of time may result in suboptimal dosing.

(5.2) - Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) - PCP prophylaxis required for all patients receiving concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy for the 42-day regimen for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (5.3) -All patients, particularly those receiving steroids, should be observed closely for the development of lymphopenia and PCP. (5.4) -Complete blood counts should be obtained throughout the treatment course as specified. (5.4) -Hepatotoxicity - fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported. Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of temozolomide. (5.5) -Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when receiving temozolomide. (5.6) 5.1 Myelosuppression Patients treated with temozolomide may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which may result in aplastic anemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome. In some cases, exposure to concomitant medications associated with aplastic anemia, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment. Prior to dosing, patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100 \\303\\227 109/L. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and platelet count exceeds 100 \\303\\227 109/L. Geriatric patients and women have been shown in clinical trials to have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression. 5.2 Myelodysplastic Syndrome Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed. 5.3 Pneumocystis Pneumonia For treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is required for all patients receiving concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy for the 42-day regimen. There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when temozolomide is administered during a longer dosing regimen. However, all patients receiving temozolomide, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely for the development of PCP regardless of the regimen. 5.4 Laboratory Tests For the concomitant treatment phase with RT, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and weekly during treatment. For the 28-day treatment cycles, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to treatment on Day 1 and on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) of each cycle. Blood counts should be performed weekly until recovery if the ANC falls below 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L and the platelet count falls below 100 \\303\\227 109/L [see Recommended Dosing and Dose Modification Guidelines (2.1)]. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving temozolomide. Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of temozolomide. 5.6 Use in Pregnancy Temozolomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of temozolomide to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 0.38 and 0.75 times the maximum recommended human dose (75 and 150 mg/m2), respectively, caused numerous fetal malformations of the external organs, soft tissues, and skeleton in both species [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>=10% incidence) are: alopecia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, constipation, anorexia, convulsions, rash, hemiparesis, diarrhea, asthenia, fever, dizziness, coordination abnormal, viral infection, amnesia, and insomnia. (6.1) The most common Grade 3 to 4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities (>=10% incidence) that have developed during treatment with temozolomide are: lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia. (6.1) Allergic reactions have also been reported.

Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme: During the concomitant phase (temozolomide+radiotherapy), adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and constipation were more frequent in the temozolomide+RT arm. The incidence of other adverse reactions was comparable in the two arms. The most common adverse reactions across the cumulative temozolomide experience were alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and constipation (see Table 7). Forty-nine percent (49%) of patients treated with temozolomide reported one or more severe or life-threatening reactions, most commonly fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%), and thrombocytopenia (5%). Overall, the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was consistent with the known safety profile of temozolomide.

Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), which is a known dose-limiting toxicity for most cytotoxic agents, including temozolomide, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse reactions were combined, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic reactions were observed in 8% of the patients, and Grade 3 or Grade 4 platelet abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic reactions, were observed in 14% of the patients treated with temozolomide. Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Tables 8 and 9 show the incidence of adverse reactions in the 158 patients in the anaplastic astrocytoma study for whom data are available. In the absence of a control group, it is not clear in many cases whether these reactions should be attributed to temozolomide or the patients' underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hematologic effects appear to be clearly drug-related. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. The adverse reactions were usually NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate in severity) and were self-limiting, with nausea and vomiting readily controlled with antiemetics. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (CTC Grade 3 or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectively. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the dose-limiting adverse reaction. It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21 to 40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1 to 44 days). Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500 cells/\\316\\274L) and thrombocytopenia (<20,000 cells/\\316\\274L) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy (12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist (N=932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia have also been reported.

Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme: During the concomitant phase (temozolomide+radiotherapy), adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and constipation were more frequent in the temozolomide+RT arm. The incidence of other adverse reactions was comparable in the two arms. The most common adverse reactions across the cumulative temozolomide experience were alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and constipation (see Table 7 ). Forty-nine percent (49%) of patients treated with temozolomide reported one or more severe or life-threatening reactions, most commonly fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%), and thrombocytopenia (5%). Overall, the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was consistent with the known safety profile of temozolomide.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse reactions were combined, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic reactions were observed in 8% of the patients, and Grade 3 or Grade 4 platelet abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic reactions, were observed in 14% of the patients treated with temozolomide. Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Tables 8 and 9 show the incidence of adverse reactions in the 158 patients in the anaplastic astrocytoma study for whom data are available. In the absence of a control group, it is not clear in many cases whether these reactions should be attributed to temozolomide or the patients' underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hematologic effects appear to be clearly drug-related. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. The adverse reactions were usually NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate in severity) and were self-limiting, with nausea and vomiting readily controlled with antiemetics. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (CTC Grade 3 or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectively. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the dose-limiting adverse reaction. It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21-40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1-44 days). Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC less than 500 cells/\\302\\265L) and thrombocytopenia (less than 20,000 cells/\\302\\265L) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy (12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist (N=932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia have also been reported.

When laboratory abnormalities and adverse reactions were combined, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic reactions were observed in 8% of the patients, and Grade 3 or Grade 4 platelet abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic reactions, were observed in 14% of the patients treated with TEMODAR. Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Tables 8 and 9 show the incidence of adverse reactions in the 158 patients in the anaplastic astrocytoma study for whom data are available. In the absence of a control group, it is not clear in many cases whether these reactions should be attributed to temozolomide or the patients' underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hematologic effects appear to be clearly drug-related. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. The adverse reactions were usually NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate in severity) and were self-limiting, with nausea and vomiting readily controlled with antiemetics. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (CTC Grade 3 or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectively. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the dose-limiting adverse reaction. It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21-40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1-44 days). Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC<500 cells/\\302\\265L) and thrombocytopenia (<20,000 cells/\\302\\265L) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy (12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist (N=932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia have also been reported.

Adverse reactions probably related to treatment that were reported from the 2 studies with the intravenous formulation (n=35) that were not reported in studies using the TEMODAR capsules were: pain, irritation, pruritus, warmth, swelling, and erythema at infusion site as well as the following adverse reactions: petechiae and hematoma. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TEMODAR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure. TEMODAR Capsules: allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported. Erythema multiforme has been reported, which resolved after discontinuation of TEMODAR and, in some cases, recurred upon rechallenge. Cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. There have been reported cases of hepatotoxicity, including elevations of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, and hepatitis. Opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) have also been reported. Cases of interstitial pneumonitis/pneumonitis, alveolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Prolonged pancytopenia, which may result in aplastic anemia, has been reported, and in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>=10% incidence) are: alopecia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, constipation, anorexia, convulsions, rash, hemiparesis, diarrhea, asthenia, fever, dizziness, coordination abnormal, viral infection, amnesia, and insomnia. (6.1) The most common Grade 3 to 4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities (>=10% incidence) that have developed during treatment with temozolomide are: lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia.

Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme: During the concomitant phase (temozolomide + radiotherapy), adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and constipation were more frequent in the temozolomide +RT arm. The incidence of other adverse reactions was comparable in the two arms. The most common adverse reactions across the cumulative temozolomide experience were alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and constipation (see Table 7). Forty-nine percent (49%) of patients treated with temozolomide reported one or more severe or life-threatening reactions, most commonly fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%), and thrombocytopenia (5%). Overall, the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was consistent with the known safety profile of temozolomide.

It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21 to 40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1 to 44 days). Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC less than 500 cells/microL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 20,000 cells/microL) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy (12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist (N=932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia have also been reported.

Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme: During the concomitant phase (Temozolomide + radiotherapy), adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and constipation were more frequent in the Temozolomide + RT arm. The incidence of other adverse reactions was comparable in the two arms. The most common adverse reactions across the cumulative Temozolomide experience were alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and constipation (see Table 7 ). Forty-nine percent (49%) of patients treated with Temozolomide reported one or more severe or life-threatening reactions, most commonly fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%), and thrombocytopenia (5%). Overall, the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was consistent with the known safety profile of Temozolomide.

Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Tables 8 and 9 show the incidence of adverse reactions in the 158 patients in the anaplastic astrocytoma study for whom data are available. In the absence of a control group, it is not clear in many cases whether these reactions should be attributed to temozolomide or the patients' underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hematologic effects appear to be clearly drug-related. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue. The adverse reactions were usually NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate in severity) and were self-limiting, with nausea and vomiting readily controlled with antiemetics. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (CTC Grade 3 or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectively. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was the dose-limiting adverse reaction. It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for platelets (range: 21- 40 days) and 28-days for neutrophils (range: 1-44 days). Only 14% (22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required hospitalization, blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression. In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/\\316\\274L) and thrombocytopenia (< 20,000 cells/\\316\\274L) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy (12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic data exist (N = 932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age 70 experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the first cycle, respectively. Pancytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia have also been reported.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug exposure. Dermatologic disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome Immune system disorders: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Erythema multiforme, which resolved after discontinuation of temozolomide and, in some cases, recurred upon rechallenge. Hematopoietic disorders: Prolonged pancytopenia, which may result in aplastic anemia and fatal outcomes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Hepatobiliary disorders: Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestasis, and hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Infections and infestations: Opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], primary and reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV), and reactivation of hepatitis B infections including some cases with fatal outcomes. Pulmonary disorders: Interstitial pneumonitis, pneumonitis, alveolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Endocrine disorders: Diabetes insipidus"$$
