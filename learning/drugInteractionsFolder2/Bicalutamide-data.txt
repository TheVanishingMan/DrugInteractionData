"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe hepatic changes and hepatic failure have been observed rarely. Monitor serum transaminase levels prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment and periodically thereafter, and for symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. Use bicalutamide with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. (5.1) Gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported during treatment with bicalutamide 150 mg when used as a single agent. (5.2) Bicalutamide is used in combination with a LHRH agonist. LHRH agonists have been shown to cause a reduction in glucose tolerance in males. Consideration should be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. (5.3) Monitoring Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is recommended. Evaluate for clinical progression if PSA increases. (5.4) 5.1 Hepatitis Rare cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury have been reported postmarketing in association with the use of bicalutamide. Hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first three to four months of treatment. Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in approximately 1% of bicalutamide patients in controlled clinical trials. Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, "flu-like" symptoms, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness), the serum transaminases, in particular the serum ALT, should be measured immediately. If at any time a patient has jaundice, or their ALT rises above two times the upper limit of normal, bicalutamide should be immediately discontinued with close follow-up of liver function. 5.2 Gynecomastia and Breast Pain In clinical trials with bicalutamide 150 mg as a single agent for prostate cancer, gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported in up to 38% and 39% of patients, respectively. 5.3 Glucose Tolerance A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonists. This may manifest as diabetes or loss of glycemic control in those with preexisting diabetes. Consideration should therefore be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. 5.4 Laboratory Tests Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) may be helpful in monitoring the patient's response. If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy, the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression. For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA, a treatment-free period of antiandrogen, while continuing the LHRH analog, may be considered."$$

Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, "flu-like" symptoms, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness), the serum transaminases, in particular the serum ALT, should be measured immediately. If at any time a patient has jaundice, or their ALT rises above two times the upper limit of normal, bicalutamide should be immediately discontinued with close follow-up of liver function. 5.2. Gynecomastia and Breast Pain In clinical trials with bicalutamide 150 mg as a single agent for prostate cancer, gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported in up to 38% and 39% of patients, respectively. 5.3. Glucose Tolerance A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonists. This may manifest as diabetes or loss of glycemic control in those with pre-existing diabetes. Consideration should therefore be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. 5.4. Laboratory Tests Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) may be helpful in monitoring the patient's response. If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy, the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression. For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA, a treatment-free period of antiandrogen, while continuing the LHRH analog, may be considered."$$

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Uncommon cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic edema and urticaria have been seen [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Cases of interstitial lung disease (some fatal), including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported with bicalutamide. Interstitial lung disease has been reported most often at doses greater than 50 mg. A few cases of fatal hepatic failure have been reported. Reduction in glucose tolerance, manifesting as diabetes or a loss of glycemic control in those with preexisting diabetes, has been reported during treatment with LHRH agonists."$$

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinical studies have not shown any drug interactions between bicalutamide and LHRH analogs (goserelin or leuprolide). There is no evidence that bicalutamide induces hepatic enzymes. In vitro studies have shown that R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 activity. Clinical studies have shown that with co-administration of bicalutamide, mean midazolam (a CYP 3A4 substrate) levels may be increased 1.5 fold (for Cmax) and 1.9 fold (for AUC). Hence, caution should be exercised when bicalutamide is co-administered with CYP 3A4 substrates. In vitro protein-binding studies have shown that bicalutamide can displace coumarin anticoagulants from binding sites.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bicalutamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Uncommon cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic edema and urticaria have been seen [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Cases of interstitial lung disease (some fatal), including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported with bicalutamide. Interstitial lung disease has been reported most often at doses greater than 50 mg. A few cases of fatal hepatic failure have been reported. Reduction in glucose tolerance, manifesting as diabetes or a loss of glycemic control in those with pre-existing diabetes, has been reported during treatment with LHRH agonists."$$

"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe hepatic injury and fatal hepatic failure have been observed. Monitor serum transaminase levels prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment and periodically thereafter, and for symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. Use bicalutamide with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. (5.1) Gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported during treatment with bicalutamide 150 mg when used as a single agent. (5.2) Bicalutamide is used in combination with an LHRH agonist. LHRH agonists have been shown to cause a reduction in glucose tolerance in males. Consideration should be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. (5.3) Monitoring Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is recommended. Evaluate for clinical progression if PSA increases. (5.4) Cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury (hepatic failure) have been reported post-marketing in association with the use of bicalutamide. Hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first three to four months of treatment. Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in approximately 1% of bicalutamide patients in controlled clinical trials. Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide, at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment, and periodically thereafter. If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, "flu-like" symptoms, dark urine, jaundice, or right upper quadrant tenderness), the serum transaminases, in particular the serum ALT, should be measured immediately. If at any time a patient has jaundice, or their ALT rises above two times the upper limit of normal, bicalutamide should be immediately discontinued with close follow-up of liver function. In clinical trials with bicalutamide 150 mg as a single agent for prostate cancer, gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported in up to 38% and 39% of patients, respectively. A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonists. This may manifest as diabetes or loss of glycemic control in those with pre-existing diabetes. Consideration should therefore be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists. Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) may be helpful in monitoring the patient's response. If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy, the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression. For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA, a treatment-free period of antiandrogen, while continuing the LHRH analog, may be considered."$$
