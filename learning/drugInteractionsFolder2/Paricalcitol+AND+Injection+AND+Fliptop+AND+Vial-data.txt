"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia: The risk may be increased when Paricalcitol Injection is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or metabolically inactive or active forms of vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium when using Paricalcitol Injection and adjust dose accordingly. (5.1) Digitalis Toxicity: Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection. (5.2) Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the concentration of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required. (5.3) Adynamic Bone Disease: May develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection accordingly. (5.4) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during Paricalcitol Injection treatment and may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D (i.e., all forms). Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Hypercalcemia may be so severe as to require emergency attention. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Prevention of such adverse reactions requires frequent serum calcium monitoring and careful Paricalcitol Injection dose adjustments. Concomitant use with other active vitamin D analogues should be avoided during Paricalcitol Injection treatment to prevent hypercalcemia. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Hypercalcemia of any cause increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 5.3 Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors will increase the levels of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing therapy with drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 5.4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5% and more frequent than placebo) include nausea, vomiting and edema. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety has been evaluated in clinical studies conducted with another paricalcitol injection product in 609 patients with CKD Stage 5. In four, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies, discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse event occurred in 6.5% of 62 patients treated with paricalcitol injection (dosage titrated as tolerated, [see Clinical Studies (14)]) and 2% of 51 patients treated with placebo for 1 to 3 months. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in the following table: Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring at a RateA patient who reported the same medical term more than once was counted only once for that medical term.of 2% or Greater in CKD Stage 5 Patients in Four Placebo-Controlled Studies Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=51) % Paricalcitol Injection (n=62) % Cardiac Disorders Palpitations 0.0 3.2 Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 7.8 12.9 Vomiting 5.9 8.1 Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage 2.0 4.8 Dry Mouth 2.0 3.2 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Edema 0.0 6.5 Chills 2.0 4.8 Pyrexia 2.0 4.8 Malaise 0.0 3.2 Infections and Infestations Pneumonia 0.0 4.8 Sepsis 2.0 4.8 Influenza 3.9 4.8 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 3.9 4.8 Specific laboratory parameters [i.e., changes in mean Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium Phosphorus product (Ca \\303\\227 P)] were followed in an open-label safety study conducted with another paricalcitol injection product for up to 13 months in duration in this patient population and results are shown below [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic reactions including rash, urticaria, and angioedema (including laryngeal edema) have been reported."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) increases paricalcitol blood levels. See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS. (5.3, 7.1) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Paricalcitol blood levels will be increased when paricalcitol is co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, monitor both PTH and serum calcium more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Zemplar has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in 609 CKD Stage 5 patients. In four, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies, discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse event occurred in 6.5% of 62 patients treated with Zemplar (dosage titrated as tolerated, see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Clinical Studies ) and 2.0% of 51 patients treated with placebo for 1 to 3 months. Adverse events occurring in the Zemplar group at a frequency of 2% or greater and with an incidence greater than that in the placebo group, regardless of causality, are presented in the following table: Adverse Event Incidence Rates for All Treated Patients In All Placebo-Controlled Studies Adverse Event Zemplar (n = 62) % Placebo (n = 51) % Overall 71 78 Cardiac Disorders Palpitations 3.2 0.0 Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3.2 2.0 Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage 4.8 2.0 Nausea 12.9 7.8 Vomiting 8.1 5.9 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Chills 4.8 2.0 Edema 6.5 0.0 Malaise 3.2 0.0 Pyrexia 4.8 2.0 Infections and Infestations Influenza 4.8 3.9 Pneumonia 4.8 0.0 Sepsis 4.8 2.0 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 4.8 3.9 A patient who reported the same medical term more than once was counted only once for that medical term. Safety parameters (changes in mean Ca, P, Ca \\303\\227 P) in an open-label safety study up to 13 months in duration support the long-term safety of Zemplar in this patient population (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Evaluation of Zemplar Injection The following adverse reactions, with a causal relationship to Zemplar, occurred in <2% of the Zemplar treated patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial data set. In addition, the following also includes adverse reactions reported in Zemplar-treated patients who participated in other studies (non placebo-controlled), including double-blind, active-controlled and open-label studies: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Anemia, lymphadenopathy Cardiac Disorders: Arrhythmia, atrial flutter, cardiac arrest Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Ear discomfort Endocrine Disorders: Hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism Eye Disorders: Conjunctivitis, glaucoma, ocular hyperemia Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, dysphagia, gastritis, intestinal ischemia, rectal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Asthenia, chest discomfort, chest pain, condition aggravated, edema peripheral, fatigue, feeling abnormal, gait disturbance, injection site extravasation, injection site pain, pain, swelling, thirst Infections and Infestations: Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, vaginal infection Investigations: Aspartate aminotransferase increased, bleeding time prolonged, heart rate irregular, laboratory test abnormal, weight decreased Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased appetite, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Joint stiffness, muscle twitching, myalgia Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified: Breast cancer Nervous System Disorders: Cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, hypoesthesia, myoclonus, paresthesia, syncope, unresponsive to stimuli Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation, confusional state, delirium, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Breast pain, erectile dysfunction Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary edema, wheezing Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Alopecia, blister, hirsutism, night sweats, rash pruritic, pruritus, skin burning sensation Vascular Disorders: Hypertension, hypotension Additional Adverse Events Reported During Post-marketing Experience Allergic reactions, such as rash, urticaria, and angioedema (including laryngeal edema) have been reported."$$
"Drug Interactions Specific interaction studies were not performed with Zemplar Injection. Paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A nor induce the clearance of drug metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study with ketoconazole and paricalcitol capsule demonstrated that ketoconazole approximately doubled paricalcitol AUC0-\\342\\210\\236 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A and ketoconazole is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while paricalcitol is co-administered with ketoconazole and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including the following drugs but not limited to: atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole. Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause, so caution should be applied when digitalis compounds are prescribed concomitantly with Zemplar."$$
