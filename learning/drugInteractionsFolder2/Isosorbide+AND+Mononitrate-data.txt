"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause symptomatic hypotension (5.1) Symptomatic Lupus Erythematosus Syndromes: Consider discontinuation if clinically appropriate (5.2) Myocardial ischemia and angina ( 5.3) Peripheral Neuritis: May be treated with Pyridoxine (5.4) 5.1 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of BiDil. Hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt depleted; correct prior to initiation of BiDil [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydralazine hydrochloride has been reported to cause a drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) syndrome. Symptoms and signs usually regress when hydralazine hydrochloride is discontinued. 5.3 Worsening Ischemic Heart Disease Hydralazine hydrochloride can cause tachycardia and hypotension potentially leading to myocardial ischemia and angina, particularly in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Peripheral Neuritis Hydralazine hydrochloride has been associated with peripheral neuritis, evidenced by paresthesia, numbness, and tingling, which may be related to an antipyridoxine effect. Pyridoxine should be added to BiDil therapy if such symptoms develop."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>= 5% more on BiDil than on placebo) were headache and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-866-516-4950 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. BiDil has been evaluated for safety in 517 heart failure patients in A-HeFT. A total of 317 of these patients received BiDil for at least 6 months, and 220 received BiDil for at least 12 months. In A-HeFT, 21% of the patients discontinued BiDil for adverse reactions compared to 12% who discontinued placebo. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in BiDil -treated than in placebo-treated patients. Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence, after rounding, >= 2% higher on BiDil than on placebo in A-HeFT, regardless of causality. The most common reasons for discontinuing BiDil in the A-HeFT trial was headache (7%). Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in the A-HeFT Study in >= 2% of Patients Treated with BiDil. BiDil (N=517) % Placebo (N=527) % Headache 50 21 Dizziness 32 14 Asthenia 14 11 Nausea 10 6 Hypotension 8 4 Sinusitis 4 2 Ventricular tachycardia 4 2 Paresthesia 4 2 Vomiting 4 2 Amblyopia 3 1 In the V-HeFT I and II clinical studies, a total of 587 patients with heart failure were treated with the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride. The type, pattern, frequency and severity of adverse reactions reported in these studies were similar to those reported in A-HeFT, described above and no unusual adverse reactions were reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BiDil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Use of BiDil: The following adverse reactions have been identified with use of BiDil. Cardiac Disorders: Palpitations Ear and labyrinth disorders: Tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders: Eyelid edema, vision blurred Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal discomfort, constipation General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Facial pain, flushing, chest discomfort, chest pain, peripheral edema Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Pain in extremity, myalgia Nervous Disorders: Dysgeusia, hypoaesthesia, migraine, syncope Renal and Urinary Disorders: Chromaturia, pulmonary renal syndrome Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Erectile dysfunction Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Erythema, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, face swelling Use of Hydralazine Hydrochloride or Isosorbide Dinitrate: The following reactions have been reported with use of either hydralazine hydrochloride or isosorbide dinitrate. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Blood dyscrasias, agranulocytosis, purpura, eosinophilia, splenomegaly. Eye Disorders: Lacrimation, conjunctivitis. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Paralytic ileus. Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis. Psychiatric Disorders: Psychotic reactions, disorientation. Renal and Urinary Disorders: Difficulty in urination."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors BiDil is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), PDE5 inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use BiDil in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Comcomitant use can cause hypotension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to ISDN are generally dose-related, and almost all of these reactions are the result of ISDN's activity as a vasodilator. Headache, which may be severe, is the most commonly reported side effect. Headache may be recurrent with each daily dose, especially at higher doses. Transient episodes of lightheadedness, occasionally related to blood pressure changes, may also occur. Hypotension occurs infrequently, but in some patients it may be severe enough to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Syncope, crescendo angina, and rebound hypertension have been reported but are uncommon. Extremely rarely, ordinary doses of organic nitrates have caused methemoglobinemia in normal-seeming patients. Methemoglobinemia is so infrequent at these doses that further discussion of its diagnosis and treatment is deferred (see OVERDOSAGE ).

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The table below shows the frequencies of the adverse events that occurred in >5% of the subjects in three placebo-controlled North American studies, in which patients in the active treatment arm received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended-Release Tablets once daily. In parentheses, the same table shows the frequencies with which these adverse events were associated with the discontinuation of treatment. Overall, 8% of the patients who received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate in the three placebo-controlled North American studies discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Most of these discontinued because of headache. Dizziness was rarely associated with withdrawal from these studies. Since headache appears to be a dose-related adverse effect and tends to disappear with continued treatment, it is recommended that ISMN treatment be initiated at low doses for several days before being increased to desired levels.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The table below shows the frequencies of the adverse events that occurred in >5% of the subjects in three placebo-controlled North American studies, in which patients in the active treatment arm received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets once daily. In parentheses, the same table shows the frequencies with which these adverse events were associated with the discontinuation of treatment. Overall, 8% of the patients who received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate in the three placebo-controlled North American studies discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Most of these discontinued because of headache. Dizziness was rarely associated with withdrawal from these studies. Since headache appears to be a dose-related adverse effect and tends to disappear with continued treatment, it is recommended that ISMN treatment be initiated at low doses for several days before being increased to desired levels FREQUENCY AND ADVERSE EVENTS (DISCONTINUED)Some individuals discontinued for multiple reasons.

BiDil BiDil has been evaluated for safety in 517 heart failure patients in A-HeFT. A total of 317 of these patients received BiDil for at least 6 months, and 220 received BiDil for at least 12 months. In A-HeFT, 21% of the patients discontinued BiDil for adverse experiences compared to 12% who discontinued placebo. Overall, adverse events were more common in BiDil-treated than in placebo-treated patients. Table 2 lists adverse events reported with an incidence of >= 2% in patients treated with BiDil in A-HeFT, and, after rounding to the nearest 1%, occurring more frequently than in the placebo group, regardless of causality. Headache and dizziness were the two most frequent adverse events and were more than twice as frequent in the BiDil group. The most common reasons for discontinuing BiDil in the A-HeFT trial were headache (7%) and dizziness (4%). Table 2. Adverse Events Occurring in the A-HeFT Study in >= 2% of Patients Treated with BiDil.

Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction, malaise. Central nervous system: Somnolence. Gastrointestinal: Cholecystitis. Metabolic: Hypercholesteremia. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia, tendon disorder. Skin: Alopecia, angioedema, sweating. In the V-HeFT I and II studies, a total of 587 patients with heart failure were treated with the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride. The type, pattern, frequency and severity of adverse experiences reported in these studies were similar to those reported in A-HeFT, and no unusual adverse experiences were reported. Prior experience with BiDil components The following additional adverse events have been reported with hydralazine hydrochloride or isosorbide dinitrate but not necessarily with BiDil: Digestive: paralytic ileus. Cardiovascular: paradoxical pressor response, crescendo angina. Neurologic: peripheral neuritis, numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, psychotic reactions, disorientation. Genitourinary: difficulty in urination. Hematologic: blood dyscrasias, agranulocytosis, purpura, splenomegaly. Hypersensitive Reactions: eosinophilia, hepatitis. Other: nasal congestion, flushing, lacrimation, conjunctivitis."$$
"Drug/Drug Interactions Due to the hydralazine component of BiDil, monoamine-oxidase inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving BiDil. Patients treated with BiDil who receive any potent parenteral antihypertensive agent should be continuously observed for several hours for excessive fall in blood pressure. The effects of BiDil on vasodilators including alcohol may be additive. Sildenafil: See WARNINGS. Vardenafil: See WARNINGS. Tadalafil: See WARNINGS."$$
