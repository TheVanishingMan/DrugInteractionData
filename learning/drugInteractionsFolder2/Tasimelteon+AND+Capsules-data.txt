"5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause somnolence: After taking HETLIOZ, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because HETLIOZ can impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness (5.1) 5.1 Somnolence After taking HETLIOZ, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed. HETLIOZ can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.",$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-438-5469 or www.hetlioz.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 1346 subjects were treated with at least one dose of HETLIOZ, of which 139 were treated for > 26 weeks and 93 were treated for > 1 year. A 26-week, parallel-arm placebo-controlled study (Study 1) evaluated HETLIOZ (n=42) compared to placebo (n=42) in patients with Non-24. A randomized-withdrawal, placebo- controlled study of 8 weeks duration (Study 2) also evaluated HETLIOZ (n=10), compared to placebo (n=10), in patients with Non-24. In placebo-controlled studies, 6% of patients exposed to HETLIOZ discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, compared with 4% of patients who received placebo. Table 1 shows the incidence of adverse reactions from Study 1. *Adverse reactions with an incidence > 5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ than on placebo are displayed. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Study 1 HETLIOZ N=42 Placebo N=42 Headache 17 % 7 % Alanine aminotransferase increased 10 % 5 % Nightmare/abnormal dreams 10 % 0 % Upper respiratory tract infection 7 % 0 % Urinary tract infection 7 % 2 %",$$
"7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine): Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of increased exposure (7.1, 12.3) Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of decreased exposure (7.2, 12.3) 7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine) Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin) Avoid use of HETLIOZ in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
