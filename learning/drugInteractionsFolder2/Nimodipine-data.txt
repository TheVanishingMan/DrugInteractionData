"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Monitor blood pressure (5.1) Patients with Cirrhosis: Higher risk of adverse reactions. Monitor blood pressure and pulse (5.2) CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors: May significantly increase risk of hypotension. Concomitant use with NYMALIZE should generally be avoided (5.3) CYP3A4 Strong Inducers: May significantly reduce efficacy of nimodipine. Concomitant use with NYMALIZE should generally be avoided (5.4) 5.1 Hypotension Blood pressure should be carefully monitored during treatment with NYMALIZE. In clinical studies of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, about 5% of nimodipine-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients had hypotension and about 1% of nimodipine-treated patients left the study because of this. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.2 Possible Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cirrhosis Given that the plasma levels of nimodipine are increased in patients with cirrhosis, these patients are at higher risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, monitor blood pressure and pulse rate closely and administer a lower dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Possible Increased Risk of Hypotension with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as some macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin), some HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), some HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, telaprevir), some azole antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), conivaptan, delaviridine, and nefazadone with nimodipine should generally be avoided because of a risk of significant hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.4 Possible Reduced Efficacy with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St John's wort) and nimodipine should generally be avoided, as nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety and efficacy of NYMALIZE (nimodipine oral solution) in the treatment of patients with SAH is based on adequate and well-controlled studies of nimodipine oral capsules in patients with SAH. NYMALIZE (nimodipine oral solution) has comparable bioavailability to nimodipine oral capsules. The following clinically significant adverse reaction appears in other sections of the labeling: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=1% and >=1% placebo) were hypotension, headache, nausea, and bradycardia (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-866-516-4950 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In clinical trials of nimodipine oral capsules in patients with SAH, eleven percent (92 of 823) of nimodipine-treated patients reported adverse events compared to six percent (29 of 479) of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse event was decreased blood pressure in 4.4% of nimodipine-treated patients. The events reported with a frequency greater than 1% are displayed in Table 1 by dose.

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Anti-Hypertensives: May increase risk of hypotension. Monitor blood pressure (7.1) CYP3A4 Moderate and Weak Inhibitors: May increase risk of hypotension. Monitor blood pressure. Dose reduction of NYMALIZE may be needed. Avoid grapefruit juice. (7.2) CYP3A4 Moderate and Weak Inducers: May reduce efficacy of NYMALIZE. Dose increase may be needed (7.3) 7.1 Blood Pressure Lowering Drugs Nimodipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of concomitantly administered anti-hypertensives such as diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, other calcium channel blockers, \\316\\261-adrenergic blockers, PDE5 inhibitors, and \\316\\261-methyldopa. In Europe, nimodipine was observed to occasionally intensify the effect of antihypertensive drugs taken concomitantly by hypertensive patients; this phenomenon was not observed in North American clinical trials. Blood pressure should be carefully monitored, and dose adjustment of the blood pressure lowering drug(s) may be necessary. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Nimodipine plasma concentration can be significantly increased when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. As a consequence, the blood pressure lowering effect may be increased. Therefore, the concomitant administration of NYMALIZE and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include some members of the following classes: -macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin,), -HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), -HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, telaprevir), -azole antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), -conivaptan, delaviridine, nefazodone Nimodipine plasma concentration can also be increased in the presence of moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4. If nimodipine is concomitantly administered with these drugs, blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the nimodipine dose may be necessary. Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors include alprozalam, ameprenavir, amiodarone, aprepitant, atazanavir, cimetidine, cyclosporine, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, isoniazid, oral contraceptives, quinuprestin/dalforpristin, valproic acid, and verapamil. A study in eight healthy volunteers has shown a 50% increase in mean peak nimodipine plasma concentrations and a 90% increase in mean area under the curve, after a one-week course of cimetidine at 1,000 mg/day and nimodipine at 90 mg/day. This effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) by cimetidine, which could decrease first-pass metabolism of nimodipine. Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4. Ingestion of grapefruit/grapefruit juice is not recommended while taking nimodipine. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers Nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Therefore, concomitant use of NYMALIZE with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's Wort) should generally be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Moderate and weak inducers of CYP3A4 may also reduce the efficacy of nimodipine. Patients on these should be closely monitored for lack of effectiveness, and a nimodipine dosage increase may be required. Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers include, for example: amprenavir, aprepitant, armodafinil, bosentan, efavirnenz, etravirine, Echinacea, modafinil, nafcillin, pioglitazone, prednisone, rufinamide, and vemurafenib."$$

"Drug Interaction: Nimodipine is metabolized via the cytochrome P450 3A4 system located both in the intestinal mucosa and in the liver. Drugs that are known to either inhibit or to induce this enzyme system may therefore alter the first pass or the clearance of nimodipine. In addition, the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensives could be enhanced when taken concomitantly with nimodipine. Inducers of CYP3A4 Nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Therefore strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) should generally not be administered concomitantly with nimodipine (see WARNINGS ). Other moderate and weak inducers of CYP3A4 may also reduce the efficacy of nimodipine, although the magnitude of decrease in nimodipine plasma concentrations is not known. Patients on these should be closely monitored for lack of effectiveness, and a nimodipine dosage increase may be required. Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers include: amprenavir, aprepitant, armodafinil, bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, Echinacea, modafinil, nafcillin, pioglitazone, prednisone and rufinamide. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Nimodipine plasma concentration can be significantly increased when concomitantly administered with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 system. As a consequence, the blood pressure lowering effect may be increased. Therefore strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with nimodipine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include some members of the following classes: - macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin,), - HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., delavirdine, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), - azole antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), - antidepressants (e.g., nefazodone) - grapefruit juice: after intake of grapefruit juice and nimodipine, the blood pressure lowering effect may last for at least 4 days after the last ingestion of grapefruit juice.

Drugs that are known to either inhibit or to induce this enzyme system may therefore alter the first pass or the clearance of nimodipine. In addition, the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensives could be enhanced when taken concomitantly with nimodipine. Inducers of CYP3A4 Nimodipine plasma concentration and efficacy may be significantly reduced when concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Therefore strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) should generally not be administered concomitantly with nimodipine (see WARNINGS ).Other moderate and weak inducers of CYP3A4 may also reduce the efficacy of nimodipine, although the magnitude of decrease in nimodipine plasma concentrations is not known. Patients on these should be closely monitored for lack of effectiveness, and a nimodipine dosage increase may be required. Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inducers include: amprenavir, aprepitant, armodafinil, bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, Echinacea, modafinil, nafcillin, pioglitazone, prednisone and rufinamide. Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Nimodipine plasma concentration can be significantly increased when concomitantly administered with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 system. As a consequence, the blood pressure lowering effect may be increased. Therefore strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with nimodipine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include some members of the following classes: - macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin,), -HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., delavirdine, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), - azole antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), - antidepressants (e.g., nefazodone) - grapefruit juice: after intake of grapefruit juice and nimodipine, the blood pressure lowering effect may last for at least 4 days after the last ingestion of grapefruit juice. Ingestion of grapefruit / grapefruit juice is therefore not recommended while taking nimodipine (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).Nimodipine plasma concentration can also be increased in the presence of moderate and weak inhibitors of CYP3A4. If nimodipine is concomitantly administered with these drugs, blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the nimodipine dose may be necessary. Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors include amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, amiodarone, alprozalam, cyclosporine, cimetidine, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, isoniazid, oral contraceptives, quinuprestin/dalforpristin, and valproic acid. Blood pressure lowering drugs Nimodipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of concomitantly administered anti-hypertensives, such as: - diuretics, - \\316\\262-blockers, - ACE inhibitors, - A1-antagonists, - other calcium antagonists, - \\316\\261-adrenergic blocking agents, - PDE5 inhibitors, - \\316\\261-methyldopa.Blood pressure should be carefully monitored, and dose adjustment of the blood pressure lowering drug(s) may be necessary."$$
