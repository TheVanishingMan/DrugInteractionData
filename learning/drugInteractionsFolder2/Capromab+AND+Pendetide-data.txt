"ADVERSE REACTIONS ProstaScint(R) (capromab pendetide) was generally well tolerated in the clinical trials. After administration of 529 single doses of Indium In 111 ProstaScint(R), adverse reactions were observed in 4% of patients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were increases in bilirubin, hypotension, and hypertension, which occurred in 1% of patients. Elevated liver enzymes and injection site reactions occurred in slightly less than 1% of patients. Other adverse reactions, listed in order of decreasing frequency, were: pruritus, fever, rash, headache, myalgia, asthenia, burning sensation in thigh, shortness of breath, and alteration of taste. Most adverse reactions were mild and readily reversible. Data from repeat administration in 61 patients revealed a similar incidence of adverse reactions (5%). No deaths were attributable to Indium In 111 ProstaScint(R) administration."$$
"Drug Interactions The effect of surgical and/or medical androgen ablation on the imaging performance of Indium In 111 ProstaScint(R) has not been studied. Preliminary data suggest hormone ablation may increase PSMA expression, with concurrent decrease in tumor expression of PSA.3 The use of ProstaScint(R) in this patient population cannot be recommended at this time."$$
