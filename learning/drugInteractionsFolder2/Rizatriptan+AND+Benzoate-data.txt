"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina MAXALT should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of MAXALT. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists, including MAXALT may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving MAXALT. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, MAXALT should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first MAXALT dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following MAXALT administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of MAXALT who have cardiovascular risk factors. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue MAXALT if these disturbances occur. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with MAXALT and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue MAXALT if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. MAXALT should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including MAXALT, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional MAXALT doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including MAXALT particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. MAXALT treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including MAXALT. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of MAXALT (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. MAXALT is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2 to 3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non\\302\\255-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) -Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) -Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) -Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) -Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) -Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) -Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2 to 3 mmHg) were observed.

Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for three doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) -Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) -Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) -Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) -Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) -Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) -Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities.

Rizatriptan benzoate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)] ."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Rizatriptan benzoate tablets should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists including rizatriptan benzoate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate tablets should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate tablets administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate tablets who have cardiovascular risk factors. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate tablets if these disturbances occur. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate tablets should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate tablets doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate tablets particularly during co\\302\\255administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate tablets treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate tablets. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$

The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence\\302\\263 5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Camber Pharmaceuticals at 1-866-795-8330 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (\\302\\2635% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence\\302\\263 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults. The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (N=3716). All reported events occurred at an incidence \\302\\263 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>)1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. General: Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia and muscle cramp/spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric: Frequent were hypoesthesia, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were vertigo, insomnia, confusion/ disorientation, gait abnormality, memory impairment, and agitation. Respiratory: Frequent was dyspnea. Infrequent was pharyngeal edema. Special Senses: Infrequent were blurred vision and tinnitus. Rare was eye swelling. Skin and Skin Appendage: Frequent was flushing. Infrequent were sweating, pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Rare was erythema, hot flashes. The adverse reaction profile seen with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with rizatriptan benzoate tablets.

The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults: In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (n=3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence >=1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>)1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia and muscle cramp/spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric: Frequent were hypoesthesia, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were vertigo, insomnia, confusion/disorientation, gait abnormality, memory impairment, and agitation. Respiratory: Frequent was dyspnea. Infrequent was pharyngeal edema. Special Senses: Infrequent were blurred vision and tinnitus. Rare was eye swelling. Skin and Skin Appendage: Frequent was flushing. Infrequent were sweating, pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Rare was erythema, hot flashes. The adverse reaction profile seen with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with rizatriptan benzoate tablets. Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: Information relating to adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) is approved for Merck & Co., Inc.'s Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets. However, due to Merck & Co., Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in other sections of the labeling or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide post-marketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Neurological/Psychiatric: Seizure. General: Allergic conditions including anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, wheezing, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Contraindications (4)]. Special Senses: Dysgeusia."$$

The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence >= 5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., at 1-800-367-3395 or go to www.bpirx.com.or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults: Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (>= 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults. Table 1: Incidence ( >=2% and Greater than Placebo) of Adverse Reactions After a Single Dose of Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets or Placebo in Adults Adverse Reactions % of Patients Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 5 mg (n = 977) Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 10 mg (n = 1,167) Placebo (n = 627) Atypical Sensations 4 5 4 Paresthesia 3 4 < 2 Pain and other Pressure Sensations 6 9 3 Chest Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 2 3 1 Neck/throat/jaw: pain/tightness/pressure < 2 2 1 Regional Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 1 2 0 Pain, location unspecified 3 3 < 2 Digestive 9 13 8 Dry Mouth 3 3 1 Nausea 4 6 4 Neurological 14 20 11 Dizziness 4 9 5 Headache < 2 2 < 1 Somnolence 4 8 4 Other Asthenia/fatigue 4 7 2 The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults: In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (n = 3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence >= 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>) 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia and muscle cramp/spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric: Frequent were hypoesthesia, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were vertigo, insomnia, confusion/disorientation, gait abnormality, memory impairment, and agitation. Respiratory: Frequent was dyspnea. Infrequent was pharyngeal edema. Special Senses: Infrequent were blurred vision and tinnitus. Rare was eye swelling. Skin and Skin Appendage: Frequent was flushing. Infrequent were sweating, pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Rare was erythema, hot flashes. The adverse reaction profile seen with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with rizatriptan benzoate tablets. Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: Information relating to adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) is approved for Merck & Co., Inc.'s Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets. However, due to Merck & Co., Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in other sections of the labeling or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide post-marketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Neurological/Psychiatric: Seizure. General: Allergic conditions including anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, wheezing, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Contraindications (4)].

The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence >=5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Generics Inc., USA at 1(888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate tablets (>=5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >=2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults.

Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling.

Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults: In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: - Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. - Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. - Chest and or Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. - Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. - Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. - Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. - Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. - Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence >= 5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults: Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (>= 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults. Table 1: Incidence (\\302\\263 2% and Greater than Placebo) of Adverse Reactions After a Single Dose of Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets or Placebo in Adults Adverse Reactions % of Patients Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 5 mg (n = 977) Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 10 mg (n = 1,167) Placebo (n = 627) Atypical Sensations 4 5 4 Paresthesia 3 4 < 2 Pain and other Pressure Sensations 6 9 3 Chest Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 2 3 1 Neck/throat/jaw: pain/tightness/pressure < 2 2 1 Regional Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 1 2 0 Pain, location unspecified 3 3 < 2 Digestive 9 13 8 Dry Mouth 3 3 1 Nausea 4 6 4 Neurological 14 20 11 Dizziness 4 9 5 Headache < 2 2 < 1 Somnolence 4 8 4 Other Asthenia/fatigue 4 7 2 The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults: In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (n = 3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence >= 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>) 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention.

Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (n = 3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence >= 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>) 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention. Musculoskeletal Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia and muscle cramp/spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric Frequent were hypoesthesia, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were vertigo, insomnia, confusion/disorientation, gait abnormality, memory impairment, and agitation. Respiratory Frequent was dyspnea. Infrequent was pharyngeal edema. Special Senses Infrequent were blurred vision and tinnitus. Rare was eye swelling. Skin and Skin Appendage Frequent was flushing. Infrequent were sweating, pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Rare was erythema, hot flashes. The adverse reaction profile seen with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with rizatriptan benzoate tablets. Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age Information relating to adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) is approved for Merck & Co., Inc.'s Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets. However, due to Merck & Co., Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in other sections of the labeling or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide post-marketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence >= 5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (>= 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults.

Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets were assessed in a controlled clinical trial in the acute treatment of migraines (Study 7) that included a total of 1382 pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age, of which 977 (72%) administered at least one dose of study treatment (rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets and/or placebo) [ ]. The incidence of adverse reactions reported for pediatric patients in the acute clinical trial was similar in patients who received rizatriptan benzoate tablets to those who received placebo. The adverse reaction pattern in pediatric patients is expected to be similar to that in adults. see Clinical Studies ( ) 14.2 Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets in Pediatric Patients In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age who used rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets (N = 1068). All reported events occurred at an incidence >= 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within system organ class and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in (>)1/100 pediatric patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 pediatric patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Frequent was fatigue. General: Infrequent was hypoacusis. Ear and labyrinth disorders: Frequent was abdominal discomfort.

The most common adverse reactions in adults were (incidence >= 5% and greater than placebo): asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (>= 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following use of 5-HT1 agonists. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Adverse experiences to rizatriptan were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 patients who received single or multiple doses of MAXALT Tablets. The most common adverse events during treatment with MAXALT were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These events appeared to be dose related. In long term extension studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to 1 year, 4% (59 out of 1525 patients) withdrew because of adverse experiences. Table 3 lists the adverse events regardless of drug relationship (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of MAXALT. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3: Incidence (>= 2% and Greater than Placebo) of Adverse Experiences After a Single Dose of MAXALT Tablets or Placebo % of Patients Adverse Experiences MAXALT 5 mg (N=977) MAXALT 10 mg (N=1167) Placebo (N=627) Atypical Sensations 4 5 4 Paresthesia 3 4 <2 Pain and other Pressure Sensations 6 9 3 Chest Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness <2 3 1 Neck/throat/jaw: pain/tightness/pressure <2 2 1 Regional Pain: tightness/pressure/heaviness <1 2 0 Pain, location unspecified 3 3 <2 Digestive 9 13 8 Dry Mouth 3 3 1 Nausea 4 6 4 Neurological 14 20 11 Dizziness 4 9 5 Headache <2 2 <1 Somnolence 4 8 4 Other Asthenia/fatigue 4 7 2 MAXALT was generally well-tolerated. Adverse experiences were typically mild in intensity and were transient. The frequencies of adverse experiences in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse event frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse experiences were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of MAXALT: In the section that follows, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of MAXALT in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used MAXALT (N=3716) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to MAXALT. All reported events are included, except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>)1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. General: Infrequent were chills, heat sensitivity, facial edema, hangover effect, and abdominal distention. Rare were fever, orthostatic effects, syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm/cold sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, hypertension, arrhythmia, and bradycardia. Rare was angina pectoris. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, thirst, acid regurgitation, dysphagia, constipation, flatulence, and tongue edema. Rare were anorexia, appetite increase, gastritis, paralysis (tongue), and eructation. Metabolic: Infrequent was dehydration. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia, muscle cramp, musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric: Frequent were hypesthesia, mental acuity decreased, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were nervousness, vertigo, insomnia, anxiety, depression, disorientation, ataxia, dysarthria, confusion, dream abnormality, gait abnormality, irritability, memory impairment, agitation and hyperesthesia. Rare were: dysesthesia, depersonalization, akinesia/bradykinesia, apprehension, hyperkinesia, hypersomnia, and hyporeflexia. Respiratory: Frequent was dyspnea.

Infrequent were urinary frequency, polyuria, and menstruation disorder. Rare was dysuria. The adverse experience profile seen with MAXALT-MLT Orally Disintegrating Tablets was similar to that seen with MAXALT Tablets. Postmarketing Experience The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and non-domestic use of rizatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Cardiovascular: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular ischemia (see WARNINGS). Cerebrovascular: Stroke. Neurological/Psychiatric: Serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS), seizure. Special Senses: Dysgeusia. General: Hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema (e.g., facial edema, tongue swelling, pharyngeal edema), wheezing, toxic epidermal necrolysis."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: - Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. - Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. - Chest and or Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. - Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. - Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. - Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. - Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. - Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults: Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3,700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (>= 5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults. Table 1: Incidence ( \\302\\263 2% and Greater than Placebo) of Adverse Reactions After a Single Dose of Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets or Placebo in Adults Adverse Reactions % of Patients Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 5 mg (n = 977) Rizatriptan Benzoate Tablets 10 mg (n = 1,167) Placebo (n = 627) Atypical Sensations 4 5 4 Paresthesia 3 4 < 2 Pain and other Pressure Sensations 6 9 3 Chest Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 2 3 1 Neck/throat/jaw: pain/tightness/pressure < 2 2 1 Regional Pain: tightness/pressure and/or heaviness < 1 2 0 Pain, location unspecified 3 3 < 2 Digestive 9 13 8 Dry Mouth 3 3 1 Nausea 4 6 4 Neurological 14 20 11 Dizziness 4 9 5 Headache < 2 2 < 1 Somnolence 4 8 4 Other Asthenia/fatigue 4 7 2 The frequencies of adverse reactions in clinical trials did not increase when up to three doses were taken within 24 hours. Adverse reaction frequencies were also unchanged by concomitant use of drugs commonly taken for migraine prophylaxis (including propranolol), oral contraceptives, or analgesics. The incidences of adverse reactions were not affected by age or gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Rizatriptan Benzoate in Adults: In the following section, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse events are presented that were not reported in other sections of the labeling. Because the reports include events observed in open studies, the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used rizatriptan benzoate and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to rizatriptan benzoate (n = 3,716). All reported events occurred at an incidence >= 1%, or are believed to be reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those defined as those occurring in at least (>) 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse experiences are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse experiences are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent was facial edema. Rare were syncope and edema/swelling. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were warm sensations. Cardiovascular: Frequent was palpitation. Infrequent were tachycardia, cold extremities, and bradycardia. Digestive: Frequent were diarrhea and vomiting. Infrequent were dyspepsia, tongue edema and abdominal distention. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were muscle weakness, stiffness, myalgia and muscle cramp/spasm. Neurological/Psychiatric: Frequent were hypoesthesia, euphoria and tremor. Infrequent were vertigo, insomnia, confusion/disorientation, gait abnormality, memory impairment, and agitation. Respiratory: Frequent was dyspnea. Infrequent was pharyngeal edema. Special Senses: Infrequent were blurred vision and tinnitus. Rare was eye swelling. Skin and Skin Appendage: Frequent was flushing. Infrequent were sweating, pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Rare was erythema, hot flashes. Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: Information relating to adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in a controlled clinical is approved for Merck & Co., Inc.'s Rizatriptan Benzoate Orally Disintegrating Tablets in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years old). However, due to Merck & Co., Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in other sections of the labeling or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide post-marketing experience, frequency of events and the role of rizatriptan benzoate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Neurological/Psychiatric: Seizure. General: Allergic conditions including anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, wheezing, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Contraindications (4)]. Special Senses: Dysgeusia."$$
"Drug Interactions (See also PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: Rizatriptan is principally metabolized via monoamine oxidase, \\342\\200\\230A' subtype (MAO-A). Plasma concentrations of rizatriptan may be increased by drugs that are selective MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., moclobemide) or nonselective MAO inhibitors [type A and B] (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and pargyline). In a drug interaction study, when MAXALT 10 mg was administered to subjects (n=12) receiving concomitant therapy with the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide 150 mg t.i.d., there were mean increases in rizatriptan AUC and Cmax of 119% and 41% respectively; and the AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was increased more than 400%. The interaction would be expected to be greater with irreversible MAO inhibitors. No pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated in patients receiving selective MAO-B inhibitors. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS; PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) Propranolol: In a study of concurrent administration of propranolol 240 mg/day and a single dose of rizatriptan 10 mg in healthy subjects (n=11), mean plasma AUC for rizatriptan was increased by 70% during propranolol administration, and a fourfold increase was observed in one subject. The AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was not affected by propranolol. (See PRECAUTIONS; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Nadolol/Metoprolol: In a drug interactions study, effects of multiple doses of nadolol 80 mg or metoprolol 100 mg every 12 hours on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 10 mg rizatriptan were evaluated in healthy subjects (n=12). No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Paroxetine: In a study of the interaction between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine 20 mg/day for two weeks and a single dose of MAXALT 10 mg in healthy subjects (n=12), neither the plasma concentrations of rizatriptan nor its safety profile were affected by paroxetine (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). Oral contraceptives: In a study of concurrent administration of an oral contraceptive during 6 days of administration of MAXALT (10-30 mg/day) in healthy female volunteers (n=18), rizatriptan did not affect plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone.",$$
"DRUG INTERACTIONS The dose of rizatriptan benzoate should be adjusted in propranolol-treated patients, as propranolol has been shown to increase the plasma AUC of rizatriptan by 70% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and rizatriptan benzoate within 24 hours is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of rizatriptan benzoate and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors. A specific MAO-A inhibitor increased the systemic exposure of rizatriptan and its metabolite [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) - Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) - Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness; Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; Evaluate patients at high risk (5.3) - Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) - Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) - Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) - Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7) Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT1 agonists including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors. Life threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if these disturbances occur. As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1 agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for three doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2-3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."$$
