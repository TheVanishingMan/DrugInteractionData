In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, unusual taste, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx. The reactions are generally transient in nature, and it is usually not necessary to discontinue treatment with albuterol sulfate syrup. In selected cases, however, dosage may be reduced temporarily; after the reaction has subsided, dosage should be increased in small increments to the optimal dosage."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse reactions to albuterol are similar in nature to reactions to other sympathomimetic agents. The most frequent adverse reactions to albuterol are nervousness, tremor, headache, tachycardia, and palpitations. Less frequent adverse reactions are muscle cramps, insomnia, nausea, weakness, dizziness, drowsiness, flushing, restlessness, irritability, chest discomfort, and difficulty in micturition. Rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, and oropharyngeal edema have been reported after the use of albuterol. In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vomiting, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, unusual taste, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx. In controlled clinical trials of adult patients conducted in the United States, the following incidence of adverse events was reported: Albuterol Extended-release Tablets Theophylline Other Beta-Agonists Placebo Event (n = 330) (n = 197) (n = 20) (n = 178) Tremor 24.2% 6.1% 35% 1.1% Headache 18.8% 26.9% 35% 20.8% Nervousness 8.5% 5.1% 10% 2.8% Nausea/Vomiting 4.2% 19.8% 5% 3.9% Tachycardia 2.7% 0.5% 5% 0% Muscle Cramps 2.7% 0.5% 5% 0.6% Palpitations 2.4% 0.5% 0% 1.1% Insomnia 2.4% 6.1% 0% 1.7% Dizziness 1.5% 2% 0% 5.1% Somnolence 0.3% 1% 0% 0.6% A trend was observed among patients treated with albuterol extended-release tablets toward increasing frequency of muscle cramps with increasing patient age (12 to 20 years, 1.2%; 21 to 30 years, 2.6%; 31 to 40 years, 6.9%; 41 to 50 years, 6.9%), compared with no such events in the placebo group.

"Drug Interactions The concomitant use of albuterol extended-release tablets and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol extended-release tablets. Such concomitant use, however, should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, then alternative therapy should be considered. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Beta-Blockers Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol extended-release tablets, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics. Digoxin Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol."$$
