"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Localized infections: Candida albicans infection of the mouth and throat may occur. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the oral cavity. Advise patients to rinse the mouth after inhalation. (5.1) -Deterioration of asthma and acute episodes: Do not use QVAR for relief of acute symptoms. Patients require immediate re-evaluation during rapidly deteriorating asthma. (5.2) -Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroids: Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from oral steroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to QVAR. (5.3) -Immunosuppression: Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; or ocular herpes simplex infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox ormeasles can occur in susceptible patients. Use with caution in patients with these infections because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (5.4) -Paradoxical Bronchospasm: Bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. Treat bronchospasm immediately with inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator and discontinue QVAR. (5.5) -Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm may occur. Discontinue QVAR if such reactions occur. (5.6) -Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression: May occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue QVAR slowly. (5.7) -Effects on growth: Monitor growth of pediatric patients. (5.8) -Decreases in bone mineral density: Monitor patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content. (5.9) -Glaucoma and cataracts: Monitor patients with change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts closely. (5.10) 5.1 Local Effects Localized infections with Candida albicans have occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients receiving QVAR. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing with QVAR therapy, but at times therapy with QVAR may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised. 5.2 Deterioration of Asthma and Acute Episodes QVAR is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta-2 agonist, not QVAR, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with QVAR. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed in patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to QVAR because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infections (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Although QVAR may provide control of asthmatic symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic steroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral or other systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from oral or other systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to QVAR. Lung function (FEV1 or PEF), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral or other systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to QVAR may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions. During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. It is not known how the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection. Nor is the contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, parasitic or viral infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled corticosteroids may produce inhalation induced bronchospasm with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing that may be life-threatening. If inhalation induced bronchospasm occurs following dosing with QVAR, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator. Treatment with QVAR should be discontinued and alternate therapy instituted. 5.6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm, may occur after administration of QVAR. Discontinue QVAR if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4.2)] 5.7 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression QVAR will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since beclomethasone dipropionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of QVAR in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with QVAR should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when beclomethasone dipropionate is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of QVAR should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms. 5.8 Effects on Growth 5.9 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density 5.10 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the use of long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts while using QVAR."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Nasal discomfort, epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.1 ) -Development of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.2 ) -Hypersensitivity, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of QNASL Nasal Aerosol. ( 5.3 ) -Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 ) -Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue QNASL Nasal Aerosol slowly. ( 5.5 ) -Potential reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving QNASL Nasal Aerosol. ( 5.6 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Nasal Discomfort, Epistaxis, and Nasal Ulceration: In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol than those who received placebo. In the 52-week safety trial in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, nasal erosions were identified in 4 of 415 patients and a nasal ulceration was identified in 1 of 415 patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. No nasal erosions or ulcerations were reported for patients who received placebo. In clinical trials conducted in pediatric patients ages 4 to 11 years, the local nasal effect was similar to those reported in patients 12 years of age and older. Patients using QNASL Nasal Aerosol over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa. If an adverse reaction (e.g., erosion, ulceration) is noted, discontinue QNASL Nasal Aerosol. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Candida Infection: In previous clinical trials with an aqueous formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate administered intranasally, localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans had been reported. There were no instances of similar infections observed in clinical trials with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. If such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of QNASL Nasal Aerosol treatment. Thus, patients using QNASL Nasal Aerosol over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection. Nasal Septal Perforation: Instances of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of beclomethasone dipropionate. There were no nasal septal perforations reported during clinical trials in the indicated dose of QNASL 80 mcg Nasal Aerosol administered as 320 mcg once daily in adults and adolescents. There was one report of nasal septal perforation observed in the dose-ranging pediatric clinical trial. Impaired Wound Healing: Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use QNASL Nasal Aerosol until healing has occurred. 5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Use of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with ocular assessments that included intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 245 adolescent and adult patients (12 years of age and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis who were treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol 320 mcg daily (N=197) or placebo (N=48) for up to 52 weeks. In 94% of patients, intraocular pressure (IOP) remained within the normal range (<21 mmHg) during the treatment portion of the trial. There were 10 patients (5%) treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol and 1 patient (2%) treated with placebo that had intraocular pressure that increased above normal levels (>=21 mmHg) and greater than baseline during the treatment portion of the trial. Two of these occurrences in patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol were reported as adverse reactions, one serious. No instances of cataract formation or other clinically significant ocular incidents were reported in this 52-week safety trial.[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and rash have been reported following administration of beclomethasone dipropionate nasally administered and inhalationally administered products. Angioedema, urticaria, and rash have been reported following administration of QNASL Nasal Aerosol. Discontinue QNASL Nasal Aerosol if any such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system (e.g., corticosteroids) are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chickenpox or measles develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effect When intranasal steroids are used at higher-than-recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of QNASL Nasal Aerosol should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression). Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Routinely monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving QNASL Nasal Aerosol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: - Candida albicans infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Growth effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] -Glaucoma and cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >3% and > placebo) include headache, pharyngitis, oral symptoms (inhalation route), and sinusitis.

The following reporting rates of common adverse experiences are based upon 4 clinical trials in which 1196 patients (671 female and 525 male adults previously treated with as-needed bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids) were treated with QVAR (doses of 40, 80, 160, or 320 mcg twice daily) or CFC-BDP (doses of 42, 168, or 336 mcg twice daily) or placebo. Table 3 below includes all events reported by patients taking QVAR (whether considered drug related or not) that occurred at a rate over 3% for QVAR. In considering these data, difference in average duration of exposure and clinical trial design should be taken into account. Table 3 Adverse Events Reported by at Least 3% of the Patients for QVAR by Treatment and Daily Dose Adverse Events Placebo (N=289) % QVAR Total (N=624) % 80-160 mcg (N=233) % 320 mcg (N=335) % 640 mcg (N=56) % HEADACHE 9 12 15 8 25 PHARYNGITIS 4 8 6 5 27 UPPER RESP TRACT INFECTION 11 9 7 11 5 RHINITIS 9 6 8 3 7 INCREASED ASTHMA SYMPTOMS 18 3 2 4 0 ORAL SYMPTOMS INHALATION ROUTE 2 3 3 3 2 SINUSITIS 2 3 3 3 0 PAIN <1 2 1 2 5 BACK PAIN 1 1 2 <1 4 DYSPHONIA 2 <1 1 0 4 Other adverse events that occurred in these clinical trials using QVAR with an incidence of 1% to 3% and which occurred at a greater incidence than placebo were nausea, dysmenorrhea, and coughing. Oropharyngeal candidiasis occurred in <1% of patients in both QVAR and placebo treatment groups. Pediatric Studies In two 12-week placebo-controlled studies in steroid naive pediatric patients 5 to 12 years of age, no clinically relevant differences were found in the pattern, severity, or frequency of adverse events compared with those reported in adults, with the exception of conditions which are more prevalent in a pediatric population generally. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions experienced in the clinical trials, the following adverse events have been reported during post-approval use of QVAR. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Local Effects: Localized infections with Candida albicans have occurred in patients treated with QVAR or other orally inhaled corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Psychiatric and Behavioral Changes: Aggression, depression, sleep disorders, psychomotor hyperactivity, and suicidal ideation have been reported (primarily in children)."$$

Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: The safety data described below for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis are based on 4 placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 6 weeks duration evaluating doses of beclomethasone nasal aerosol from 80 to 320 mcg once daily. These short-term trials included a total of 1394 patients with either seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. Of these, 575 (378 female and 197 male) received at least one dose of QNASL Nasal Aerosol, 320 mcg once daily and 578 (360 female and 218 male) received placebo. Patient ages ranged from 12 to 82 years and the racial distribution of patients was 81% white, 16% black, and 4% other. Short-Term (2-6 Weeks) Trials: Less than 2% of patients in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions with the rate of withdrawal among patients who received QNASL Nasal Aerosol similar to or lower than the rate among patients who received placebo. Table displays the common adverse reactions (>= 1% and greater than placebo-treated patients). Table 1. Adverse Events With >= 1% Incidence and Greater than Placebo in QNASL Nasal Aerosol-Treated Adult and Adolescent Patients with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 6 Weeks Duration (Safety Population) Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older QNASL Nasal Aerosol 320 mcg (N = 575) n (%) Placebo (N = 578) n (%) Nasal Discomfort 30 (5.2) 28 (4.8) Epistaxis 11 (1.9) 7 (1.2) Headache 13 (2.3) 9 (1.6) Nasal ulcerations occurred in 2 patients treated with placebo and in 1 patient treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not have sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Long-Term 52-Week Safety Trial: In a 52-week placebo-controlled long-term safety trial in patients with PAR, 415 patients (128 males and 287 females, aged 12 to 74 years) were treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol at a dose of 320 mcg once daily and 111 patients (44 males and 67 females, aged 12 to 67 years) were treated with placebo. Of the 415 patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol, 219 patients were treated for 52 weeks and 196 patients were treated for 30 weeks. While most adverse events were similar in type and rate between the treatment groups, epistaxis occurred more frequently in patients who received QNASL Nasal Aerosol (45 out of 415, 11%) than in patients who received placebo (2 out of 111, 2%). Epistaxis also tended to be more severe in patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol. In 45 reports of epistaxis in patients who received QNASL Nasal Aerosol, 27, 13, and 5 cases were of mild, moderate, and severe intensity, respectively, while the reports of epistaxis in patients who received placebo were of mild (1) and moderate (1) intensity. Seventeen patients treated with QNASL Nasal Aerosol experienced adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the trial compared to 3 patients treated with placebo. There were 4 nasal erosions and 1 nasal septum ulceration which occurred in patients who received QNASL Nasal Aerosol, and no erosions or ulcerations noted in patients who received placebo. No patient experienced a nasal septum perforation during the trial. Pediatric Patients Aged 4 to 11 Years: The safety data described below for pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis are based on 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials. These trials were 2 to 12 weeks in duration, evaluated doses of beclomethasone nasal aerosol 80 mcg to 160 mcg once daily and included a total of 1360 patients with either seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. Of these, 668 (312 female and 356 male) received at least one dose of QNASL Nasal Aerosol, 80 mcg once daily, 241 (116 female and 125 male) received QNASL Nasal Aerosol 160 mcg once daily, and 451 (203 female and 248 male) received placebo. The racial distribution of patients was 73% white, 20% black, and 6% other. Based on the results from the dose ranging trial, 80 mcg once daily was chosen as the dose in pediatric patients. Less than 1.5% of patients in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions with the rate of withdrawal among patients who received QNASL Nasal Aerosol 80 mcg once daily similar to or lower than the rate among patients who received placebo. Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (>= 2% and greater than placebo-treated patients). Additionally, epistaxis was reported at a rate of 4% for both QNASL Nasal Aerosol 80 mcg once daily and placebo treated patients. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to beclomethasone dipropionate or a combination of these factors. QNASL Nasal Aerosol: sneezing, burning sensation Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate: Nasal septal perforation, glaucoma, cataracts, loss of taste and smell, and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported following intranasal administration of beclomethasone dipropionate.

Adverse Events With >= 2% Incidence and Greater than Placebo in QNASL Nasal Aerosol-Treated Pediatric Patients with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 12 weeks Duration (Safety Population) Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age QNASL Nasal Aerosol 80 mcg (N=668) n (%) Placebo (N=451) n (%) Headache 23 (3.4) 15 (3.3) Pyrexia 19 (2.8) 7 (1.6) Upper respiratory tract infection 17 (2.5) 8 (1.8) Nasopharyngitis 15 (2.2) 6 (1.3) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials for QNASL Nasal Aerosol, the following adverse events have been reported during postmarketing use of QNASL Nasal Aerosol or other intranasal and inhaled formulations of beclomethasone dipropionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to beclomethasone dipropionate or a combination of these factors. QNASL Nasal Aerosol: sneezing, burning sensation Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate: Nasal septal perforation, glaucoma, cataracts, loss of taste and smell, and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported following intranasal administration of beclomethasone dipropionate. Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and bronchospasm have been reported following the oral inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reporting rates of common adverse experiences are based upon 4 clinical trials in which 1196 Patients (671 female and 525 male adults previously treated with as-needed bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids) were treated with QVAR (doses of 40, 80, 160, or 320 mcg twice daily) or CFC-BDP (doses of 42, 168, or 336 mcg twice daily) or placebo. The table below includes all events reported by patients taking QVAR (whether considered drug related or not) that occurred at a rate over 3% for either QVAR or CFC-BDP. In considering these data, difference in average duration of exposure and clinical trial design should be taken into account. Adverse Events Reported by at Least 3% of the Patients for Either QVAR or CFC-BDP by Treatment and Daily Dose Adve rse Events QVAR CFC-BDP Placebo (N=289) % Total (N=624) % 80-160 mcg (N=233) % 320 mcg (N=335) % 640 mcg (N=56) % Total (N=283) % 84 mcg (N=59) % 336 mcg (N=55) % 672 mcg (N=169) % HEADACHE 9 12 15 8 25 15 14 11 17 PHARYNGITIS 4 8 6 5 27 10 12 9 10 UPPER RESP TRACT INFECTION 11 9 7 11 5 12 3 9 17 RHINITIS 9 6 8 3 7 11 15 9 10 INCREASED ASTHMA SYMPTOMS 18 3 2 4 0 8 14 5 7 ORAL SYMPTOMS INHALATION ROUTE 2 3 3 3 2 6 7 5 5 SINUSITIS 2 3 3 3 0 4 7 2 4 PAIN <1 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 BACK PAIN 1 1 2 <1 4 4 2 4 4 NAUSEA 0 1 <1 1 2 3 5 5 1 DYSPHONIA 2 <1 1 0 4 4 0 0 6 Other adverse events that occurred in these clinical trials using QVAR with an incidence of 1% to 3% and which occurred at a greater incidence than placebo were: dysphonia, dysmenorrhea and coughing. No patients treated with QVAR in the clinical development program developed symptomatic oropharyngeal candidiasis. If such an infection develops, treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy or discontinuance of treatment with QVAR may be required. Pediatric Studies In two 12-week placebo-controlled studies in steroid naive pediatric patients 5 to 12 years of age, no clinically relevant differences were found in the pattern, severity, or frequency of adverse events compared with those reported in adults, with the exception of conditions which are more prevalent in a pediatric population generally. Adverse Event Reports from Other Sources Rare cases of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, rash, and bronchospasm, have been reported following the oral and intranasal inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate. During postmarketing experience, psychiatric events and behavioral changes such as aggression, depression, sleep disorders, psychomotor hyperactivity, and suicidal ideation have been reported (primarily in children). Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."$$
