"Drug Interactions Folic acid in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible children. Preliminary animal and human studies have shown that small quantities of systemically administered leucovorin enter CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and, in humans, remain 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration. However, high doses of leucovorin may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate. Leucovorin may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil (see WARNINGS)."$$
