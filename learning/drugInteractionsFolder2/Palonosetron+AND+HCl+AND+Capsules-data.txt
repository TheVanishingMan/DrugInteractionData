"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5.1) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (5.2) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Hypersensitivity reactions have been very rarely reported post-marketing for intravenous palonosetron: dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria. No hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for oral palonosetron. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g.,tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ALOXI and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ALOXI and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ALOXI is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS No adverse reactions have been reported at an incidence of >=5 % for the 0.5 mg dose. Headache and constipation are the most common adverse reactions but occur less frequently (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EISAI at 1- 888-422-4743 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, 693 adult patients received oral palonosetron in doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 0.75 mg. Following is a listing of drug related adverse reactions reported by >= 2% of patients from two clinical trials. Table 1: Adverse Reactions >= 2% from Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Studies Event 0.25 mg (N=157) 0.5 mg (N=161) 0.75 mg (N=375) 0.25 mg I.V. (N=163) Headache 6 (3.8%) 6 (3.7%) 21 (5.6%) 14 (8.6%) Constipation 1 (0.6%) 1 (0.6%) 9 (2.4%) 5 (3.1%) The infrequently reported adverse reactions listed below, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown/missing, occurred following administration of ALOXI Capsules to adult patients receiving concomitant cancer chemotherapy. Of these adverse events, fatigue (incidence 1%), was the only adverse event reported at an incidence of >=1%. In general, adverse reactions were similar between oral and I.V. formulations. Blood and Lymphatic System: <1%: anemia. Cardiovascular: <1%: hypertension, transient arrhythmia, first degree atrioventricular block, second degree atrioventricular block, QTc prolongation. Hearing and Labyrinth: <1%: motion sickness. Eye: <1%: eye swelling. Gastrointestinal System: <1%: gastritis, nausea, vomiting. General: 1%: fatigue, <1%: chills, pyrexia. Infections: <1%: sinusitis. Liver: <1%: transient, asymptomatic increases in bilirubin. Nutrition: <1%: anorexia. Musculoskeletal: <1%: joint stiffness, myalgia, pain in extremity. Nervous System: <1%: postural dizziness, dysgeusia. Psychiatric: <1%: insomnia. Respiratory System: <1%: dyspnea, epistaxis. Skin: <1%: generalized pruritus, erythema, alopecia. Very rare cases (<1/10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for I.V. ALOXI from post-marketing experience."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Palonosetron is eliminated from the body through both renal excretion and metabolic pathways with the latter mediated via multiple CYP enzymes. Further in vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A study in healthy volunteers involving single-dose I.V. palonosetron (0.75 mg) and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Concomitant administration of an antacid (Maalox(R) liquid 30 mL) had no effect on the oral absorption or pharmacokinetics of a single capsule of palonosetron 0.75 mg in healthy subjects. In controlled clinical trials, ALOXI Capsules have been safely administered with chemotherapeutic agents, systemic corticosteroids, analgesics, and drugs for gastrointestinal disorders including function gastrointestinal disorders, acid-related disorders, and antiemetics/antinauseants. Palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumor activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C) in murine tumor models. The potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low (7)"$$
