"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal procedure-related complications may result in serious outcomes, such as need for surgery or death (5.1) May cause falling asleep during activities of daily living (5.2) Monitor patients for orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting DUOPA or increasing the dose (5.3) Hallucinations/Psychosis/Confusion: May respond to dose reduction in levodopa (5.4) Impulse Control Disorders: Consider dose reductions or stopping DUOPA (5.5) Monitor patients for depression and suicidality (5.6) Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction to reduce the risk of withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion (5.7) May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia: Consider dose reduction (5.8) Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (5.9) 5.1 Gastrointestinal and Gastrointestinal Procedure-Related Risks Because DUOPA is administered using a PEG-J or naso-jejunal tube, gastrointestinal complications can occur. These complications include bezoar, ileus, implant site erosion/ulcer, intestinal hemorrhage, intestinal ischemia, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum, and post-operative wound infection. These complications may result in serious outcomes, such as the need for surgery or death. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider immediately if they experience abdominal pain, prolonged constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or melanotic stool [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.2 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with levodopa, a component of DUOPA, have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on levodopa, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack), such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than one year after initiation of treatment. Falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in patients experiencing preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness in DUOPA-treated patients, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients who have already experienced somnolence or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities while taking DUOPA. Before initiating treatment with DUOPA, advise patients about the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with DUOPA such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or the presence of sleep disorders. Consider discontinuing DUOPA in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating). If DUOPA is continued, they should be advised to avoid driving and other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patient becomes somnolent. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension DUOPA-treated patients were more likely to experience a decline in orthostatic blood pressure than patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in the controlled clinical study. Orthostatic systolic hypotension (>=30 mm Hg decrease) occurred in 73% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 68% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa in the controlled clinical study. Orthostatic diastolic hypotension (>=20 mm Hg decrease) occurred in 70% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 62% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Inform patients about the risk for hypotension and syncope. Monitor patients for orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting DUOPA or increasing the dose. 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychosis/Confusion There is an increased risk for hallucinations and psychosis in patients taking DUOPA. In the controlled clinical trial, hallucinations occurred in 5% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 3% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Confusion occurred in 8% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 3% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa, and psychotic disorder occurred in 5% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 3% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. Hallucinations associated with levodopa may present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa. Confusion, insomnia, and excessive dreaming may accompany hallucinations. Abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychosis, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with DUOPA. In addition, medications that antagonize the effects of dopamine used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of DUOPA [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Patients may experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including DUOPA, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with DUOPA. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing DUOPA if a patient develops such urges. 5.6 Depression and Suicidality In the controlled clinical trial, 11% of DUOPA-treated patients developed depression compared to 3% of oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa-treated patients. Monitor patients for the development of depression and concomitant suicidal tendencies. 5.7 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking DUOPA. If DUOPA is discontinued, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.8 Dyskinesia DUOPA may cause or exacerbate dyskinesias. In the controlled clinical trial, dyskinesia occurred in 14% of DUOPA-treated patients compared to 12% of patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require a dosage reduction of DUOPA or other medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. 5.9 Neuropathy In clinical studies, 19 of 412 (5%) patients treated with DUOPA developed a generalized polyneuropathy. The onset of neuropathy could be determined in 13 of 19 patients. Most cases (12/19) were classified as subacute or chronic in onset. The neuropathy was most often characterized as sensory or sensorimotor. Electrodiagnostic testing performed in 16 patients was most often (15/16) consistent with an axonal polyneuropathy, and one patient was classified as having a demyelinating neuropathy. There was insufficient information to determine the potential role of vitamin deficiencies in the etiology of neuropathy associated with DUOPA. Patients should have clinical assessments for the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy before starting DUOPA. Monitor patients periodically for signs of neuropathy after starting DUOPA, especially in patients with pre-existing neuropathy and in patients taking medications or those who have medical conditions that are also associated with neuropathy. 5.10 Cardiovascular Ischemic Events In clinical studies, myocardial infarction and arrhythmia were reported in patients taking carbidopa-levodopa. Ask patients about symptoms of ischemic heart disease and arrhythmia, especially those with a history of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias. 5.11 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2 to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical studies, 2 of 416 (0.5%) DUOPA-treated patients developed melanoma. Appropriately qualified health care providers (e.g., dermatologists) should perform periodic skin examinations to monitor for melanoma in patients receiving DUOPA. 5.12 Laboratory Test Abnormalities DUOPA may increase the risk for elevated (above the upper limit of normal for the reference range) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In the controlled clinical trial, the shift from a low or normal value at baseline to an increased BUN value was greater for DUOPA-treated patients (13%) than for patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (4%). The shift from a low or normal value at baseline to an increased CPK value was greater for DUOPA-treated patients (17%) than for patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (7%). The incidence of patients with a markedly increased BUN (>=10 mmol/L; >=28 mg/dL) was greater for patients treated with DUOPA (11%) than that for patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (0%). The incidence of patients with an increased CPK (>3 times the upper limit of normal) was greater for patients treated with DUOPA (9%) than that for patients treated with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (0%). Patients taking levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa may have increased levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in plasma and urine giving false positive results suggesting the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in patients on levodopa and carbidopa-levodopa. 5.13 Glaucoma Carbidopa-levodopa may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma after starting DUOPA.",$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The following adverse reactions described in this section are related to at least one of the components of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets (i.e., levodopa, carbidopa, and/or entacapone) based upon the safety experience in clinical trials (especially pivotal trials) or in postmarketing reports. -May cause falling asleep during activities of daily living without apparent warning, and daytime drowsiness and somnolence (5.1) -May cause syncope and hypotension/orthostatic hypotension (5.2) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.3) -May cause depression and suicidality (5.4) -May cause hallucinations and/or other psychotic-like behavior (5.5) -May cause problems with impulse control and compulsive behaviors (5.6) -Abrupt discontinuation may cause hyperpyrexia and confusion (5.7) -May cause diarrhea and/or drug-induced colitis (5.8) -May cause rhabdomyolysis (5.9) -Increased risk of melanoma (5.10) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets or other carbidopa/levodopa products have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in activities of daily living (including the operation of motor vehicles). Some of these episodes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while taking entacapone, some did not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported to occur up to one year after initiation of treatment. Somnolence was reported in 2% of patients taking entacapone and 0% in placebo in controlled trials. It is reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients who have already experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. Before initiating treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase this risk such as use of concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. If the decision is made to continue carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish whether dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Hypotension, Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Reports of syncope were generally more frequent in patients in both treatment groups who had had a prior episode of documented hypotension (although the episodes of syncope, obtained by history, were themselves not documented with vital sign measurement). Hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope are observed in patients treated with drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone including carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. 5.3 Dyskinesia Dyskinesia (involuntary movements) may occur or be exacerbated at lower dosages and sooner with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets than with preparations containing only carbidopa and levodopa. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. In pivotal trials, the treatment difference incidence of dyskinesia was 10% and for carbidopa-levodopa plus 200 mg entacapone. Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect, many patients in controlled trials continued to experience frequent dyskinesias despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa. The treatment difference incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1% for carbidopa-levodopa-entacapone. 5.4 Depression and Suicidality All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. 5.5 Hallucinations and/or Psychotic-Like Behavior Dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with hallucinations. Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0.8% and 0% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, respectively. Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1.0% and 0.3% of patients in the carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, groups, respectively. Agitation occurred in 1% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and 0% treated with carbidopa, levodopa. 5.6 Impulse Control and/or Compulsive Behaviors Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and which increase central dopaminergic tone, including entacapone taken with levodopa and carbidopa. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 5.7 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Cases of hyperpyrexia and confusion resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of therapy with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone. However, in some cases, hyperpyrexia and confusion were reported after initiation of treatment with entacapone. Hyperpyrexia and confusion are uncommon but they may be life-threatening with a variety of features, including hyperpyrexia/fever/hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness/mental status changes, delirium, autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension, and abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin). If a patient needs to discontinue or reduce their daily dose of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the dose should be decreased slowly, with supervision from a health care provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Specific methods for tapering entacapone have not been systematically evaluated. 5.8 Diarrhea and Colitis In clinical trials of entacapone, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10.0%) and 16 of 400 (4.0%) of patients treated with 200 mg of entacapone or placebo in combination with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, respectively. In patients treated with entacapone, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of entacapone. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia. Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when entacapone treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone. If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered. 5.9 Rhabdomyolysis Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported with entacapone when used in combination with carbidopa and levodopa. Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may possibly account for rhabdomyolysis. Most of the cases were manifested by myalgia and increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin. Some of the reactions also included fever and/or alteration of consciousness. It is also possible that rhabdomyolysis may be a result of the syndrome described in Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 5.10 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examination should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.11 Interaction with Drugs Metabolized by COMT Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rate, arrhythmia, and/or increased blood pressure. 5.12 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents. These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions may be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, a possible causal role of nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone, levodopa), which increase dopaminergic activity, has also been considered. The expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone during its clinical development. Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported during clinical development of entacapone; 3 of these patients were also treated with pergolide and 1 with bromocriptine. The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months. 5.13 Peptic Ulcer Disease As with levodopa, treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. As with levodopa, periodic evaluation of hepatic function is recommended during extended therapy. 5.15 Laboratory Tests Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets than with levodopa. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy."$$

The treatment difference incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1% for carbidopa-levodopa-entacapone. 5.4 Depression and Suicidality All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. 5.5 Hallucinations and/or Psychotic-Like Behavior Dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with hallucinations. Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0.8% and 0% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, respectively. Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1.0% and 0.3% of patients in the carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, groups, respectively. Agitation occurred in 1% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and 0% treated with carbidopa, levodopa. 5.6 Impulse Control and/or Compulsive Behaviors Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and which increase central dopaminergic tone, including entacapone taken with levodopa and carbidopa. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued.

If a patient needs to discontinue or reduce their daily dose of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the dose should be decreased slowly, with supervision from a health care provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Specific methods for tapering entacapone have not been systematically evaluated. 5.8 Diarrhea and Colitis In clinical trials of entacapone, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10.0%) and 16 of 400 (4.0%) of patients treated with 200 mg of entacapone or placebo in combination with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, respectively.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered. 5.9 Rhabdomyolysis Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported with entacapone when used in combination with carbidopa and levodopa. Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may possibly account for rhabdomyolysis. Most of the cases were manifested by myalgia and increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin. Some of the reactions also included fever and/or alteration of consciousness. It is also possible that rhabdomyolysis may be a result of the syndrome described in Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 5.10 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examination should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.11 Interaction with Drugs Metabolized by COMT Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rate, arrhythmia, and/or increased blood pressure. 5.12 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents.

The expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone during its clinical development. Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported during clinical development of entacapone; 3 of these patients were also treated with pergolide and 1 with bromocriptine. The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months. 5.13 Peptic Ulcer Disease As with levodopa, treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. As with levodopa, periodic evaluation of hepatic function is recommended during extended therapy. 5.15 Laboratory Tests Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets than with levodopa. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The following adverse reactions described in this section are related to at least one of the components of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets (i.e., levodopa, carbidopa, and/or entacapone) based upon the safety experience in clinical trials (especially pivotal trials) or in postmarketing reports. May cause falling asleep during activities of daily living without apparent warning, and daytime drowsiness and somnolence (5.1) May cause syncope and hypotension/orthostatic hypotension (5.2) May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.3) May cause depression and suicidality (5.4) May cause hallucinations and/or other psychotic-like behavior (5.5) May cause problems with impulse control and compulsive behaviors (5.6) Abrupt discontinuation may cause hyperpyrexia and confusion (5.7) May cause diarrhea and/or drug-induced colitis (5.8) May cause rhabdomyolysis (5.9) Increased risk of melanoma (5.10) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets or other carbidopa/levodopa products have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in activities of daily living (including the operation of motor vehicles). Some of these episodes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while taking entacapone, some did not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported to occur up to one year after initiation of treatment. Somnolence was reported in 2% of patients taking entacapone and 0% in placebo in controlled trials. It is reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients who have already experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. Before initiating treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase this risk such as use of concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. If the decision is made to continue carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish whether dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Hypotension, Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Reports of syncope were generally more frequent in patients in both treatment groups who had had a prior episode of documented hypotension (although the episodes of syncope, obtained by history, were themselves not documented with vital sign measurement). Hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope are observed in patients treated with drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone including carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets. 5.3 Dyskinesia Dyskinesia (involuntary movements) may occur or be exacerbated at lower dosages and sooner with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets than with preparations containing only carbidopa and levodopa. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. In pivotal trials, the treatment difference incidence of dyskinesia was 10% and for carbidopa-levodopa plus 200 mg entacapone. Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect, many patients in controlled trials continued to experience frequent dyskinesias despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa. The treatment difference incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1% for carbidopa-levodopa-entacapone. 5.4 Depression and Suicidality All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Patients with past or current psychoses should be treated with caution. 5.5 Hallucinations and/or Psychotic-Like Behavior Dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with hallucinations. Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0.8% and 0% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, respectively. Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1.0% and 0.3% of patients in the carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and carbidopa, levodopa, groups, respectively. Agitation occurred in 1% of patients treated with carbidopa, levodopa, entacapone and 0% treated with carbidopa, levodopa. 5.6 Impulse Control and/or Compulsive Behaviors Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and which increase central dopaminergic tone, including entacapone taken with levodopa and carbidopa. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tabletsif a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 5.7 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Cases of hyperpyrexia and confusion resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of therapy with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone. However, in some cases, hyperpyrexia and confusion were reported after initiation of treatment with entacapone. Hyperpyrexia and confusion are uncommon but they may be life-threatening with a variety of features, including hyperpyrexia/fever/hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness/mental status changes, delirium, autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension, and abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin). If a patient needs to discontinue or reduce their daily dose of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the dose should be decreased slowly, with supervision from a health care provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Specific methods for tapering entacapone have not been systematically evaluated. 5.8 Diarrhea and Colitis In clinical trials of entacapone, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10.0%) and 16 of 400 (4.0%) of patients treated with 200 mg of entacapone or placebo in combination with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, respectively. In patients treated with entacapone, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of entacapone. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia. Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when entacapone treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone. If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered. 5.9 Rhabdomyolysis Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported with entacapone when used in combination with carbidopa and levodopa. Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may possibly account for rhabdomyolysis. Most of the cases were manifested by myalgia and increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin. Some of the reactions also included fever and/or alteration of consciousness. It is also possible that rhabdomyolysis may be a result of the syndrome described in Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 5.10 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examination should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.11 Interaction with Drugs Metabolized by COMT Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rate, arrhythmia, and/or increased blood pressure. 5.12 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents. These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions may be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, a possible causal role of nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone, levodopa), which increase dopaminergic activity, has also been considered. The expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone during its clinical development. Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported during clinical development of entacapone; 3 of these patients were also treated with pergolide and 1 with bromocriptine. The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months. 5.13 Peptic Ulcer Disease As with levodopa, treatment with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. As with levodopa, periodic evaluation of hepatic function is recommended during extended therapy. 5.15 Laboratory Tests Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets than with levodopa. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy."$$

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The following adverse reactions described in this section are related to at least one of the components of Stalevo (i.e., levodopa, carbidopa, and/or entacapone) based upon the safety experience in clinical trials (especially pivotal trials) or in postmarketing reports. May cause falling asleep during activities of daily living without apparent warning, and daytime drowsiness and somnolence (5.1) May cause syncope and hypotension/orthostatic hypotension (5.2) May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.3) May cause depression and suicidality (5.4) May cause hallucinations and/or other psychotic-like behavior (5.5) May cause problems with impulse control and compulsive behaviors (5.6) Abrupt discontinuation may cause hyperpyrexia and confusion (5.7) May cause diarrhea and/or drug-induced colitis (5.8) May cause rhabdomyolysis (5.9) Increased risk of melanoma (5.10) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients with Parkinson's disease treated with Stalevo or other carbidopa/levodopa products have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in activities of daily living (including the operation of motor vehicles).

Hyperpyrexia and confusion are uncommon but they may be life-threatening with a variety of features, including hyperpyrexia/fever/hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness/mental status changes, delirium, autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension, and abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin). If a patient needs to discontinue or reduce their daily dose of Stalevo, the dose should be decreased slowly, with supervision from a health care provider [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Specific methods for tapering entacapone have not been systematically evaluated. 5.8 Diarrhea and Colitis In clinical trials of entacapone, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10.0%) and 16 of 400 (4.0%) of patients treated with 200 mg of entacapone or placebo in combination with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, respectively. In patients treated with entacapone, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of entacapone. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia. Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when entacapone treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone. If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Stalevo, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered. 5.9 Rhabdomyolysis Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported with entacapone when used in combination with carbidopa and levodopa. Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may possibly account for rhabdomyolysis. Most of the cases were manifested by myalgia and increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin. Some of the reactions also included fever and/or alteration of consciousness. It is also possible that rhabdomyolysis may be a result of the syndrome described in Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 5.10 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Stalevo, for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examination should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.11 Interaction with Drugs Metabolized by COMT Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rate, arrhythmia, and/or increased blood pressure. 5.12 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents. These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions may be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, a possible causal role of nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone, levodopa), which increase dopaminergic activity, has also been considered. The expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone during its clinical development. Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported during clinical development of entacapone; 3 of these patients were also treated with pergolide and 1 with bromocriptine. The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months. 5.13 Peptic Ulcer Disease As with levodopa, treatment with Stalevo may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. As with levodopa, periodic evaluation of hepatic function is recommended during extended therapy. 5.15 Laboratory Tests Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of Stalevo than with levodopa. Stalevo may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy."$$

In clinical studies, 416 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received DUOPA. 338 patients were treated with DUOPA for more than 1 year, 233 patients were treated with DUOPA for more than 2 years, and 162 patients were treated with DUOPA for more than 3 years. In a 12-week, active-controlled clinical trial (Study 1), a total of 71 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled and had a PEG-J procedure. Of these, 37 patients received DUOPA and 34 received oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. The most common adverse reactions for DUOPA (incidence at least 7% greater than oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa) were: complication of device insertion, nausea, depression, peripheral edema, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, atelectasis, and incision site erythema.

The most common adverse reactions associated with complications due to PEG-J insertion were: abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, flatulence, or pneumoperitoneum. Additional adverse reactions that were co-reported with complication of naso-jejunal and PEG-J insertion included upper abdominal pain, duodenal ulcer, duodenal ulcer hemorrhage, erosive duodenitis, erosive gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, peritonitis, post-operative abscess, and small intestine ulcer."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Drugs metabolized by COMT: use with caution (5.11,7.2) -Anti-hypertensive agents: dose adjustment may be required (7.3) -Tricyclic antidepressants: risk of hypertension and dyskinesia reported during concomitant use with carbidopa/levodopa (7.4) -Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, isoniazid, phenytoin, papaverine and iron salts: may reduce efficacy of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets (7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9) -Drugs that interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation and intestinal beta-glucuronidase: dose adjustment of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may be required (7.10) -Drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., coumadin): dose adjustment of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets may be required; monitor INR when initiating carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets in patients on coumadin (7.11) 7.1 MAO Inhibitors Patients receiving nonselective MAO inhibitors and carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone may be at risk of increased adrenergic tone. Therefore, the use of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets are contraindicated in patients receiving nonselective MAO inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Drugs Metabolized by Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rates, possibly arrhythmias, and excessive changes in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. 7.3 Antihypertensive Agents Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when carbidopa/levodopa was added to the treatment of patients receiving antihypertensive drugs. When starting therapy with carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, dosage adjustment of antihypertensive drug may be required. 7.4 Tricyclic Antidepressants There have been reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa/levodopa. 7.5 Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. 7.6 Isoniazid Isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa, a dose increase may be necessary. 7.7 Phenytoin The beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin. Patients taking phenytoin with carbidopa/levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets dosage should be increased as clinically needed in patients receiving phenytoin. 7.8 Papaverine The beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by papaverine. Patients taking papaverine with carbidopa/levodopa should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets dosage should be increased as clinically needed in patients receiving papaverine. 7.9 Iron Salts Iron salts or multi vitamins containing iron salts should be coadministered with caution. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone and consequently reduce bioavailability of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone. 7.10 Drugs Known to Interfere with Biliary Excretion, Glucuronidation, and Intestinal Beta-glucuronidase As most entacapone excretion is via the bile, caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation, and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with entacapone. These include probenecid, cholestyramine, and some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol). 7.11 Drugs Metabolized via CYP2C9 (e.g., coumadin) The dosage of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets should be adjusted as clinically needed in patients using other drugs metabolized via CYP2C9. An interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone increased the AUC of R-warfarin on average by 18%, and the INR values on average by 13%. Cases of increased INR in patients concomitantly using warfarin have been reported during the post-approval use of entacapone. Thus, monitoring of INR is recommended when carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin."$$

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Selective MAO-B inhibitors: May cause orthostatic hypotension (7.1) Antihypertensive drugs: May cause symptomatic postural hypotension. Dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be needed (7.2) Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, isoniazid, iron salts, and high-protein diet may reduce the effectiveness of DUOPA (7.3, 7.4, 7.5) 7.1 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors The use of nonselective MAO inhibitors with DUOPA is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue use of any nonselective MAO inhibitors at least two weeks prior to initiating DUOPA. The use of selective MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline and selegiline) with DUOPA may be associated with orthostatic hypotension. Monitor patients who are taking these drugs. 7.2 Antihypertensive Drugs The concurrent use of DUOPA with antihypertensive medications can cause symptomatic postural hypotension. A dose reduction of the antihypertensive medication may be needed after starting or increasing the dose of DUOPA. 7.3 Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists and Isoniazid Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide, papaverine) and isoniazid may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa. Monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms. 7.4 Iron Salts Iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts can form chelates with levodopa, carbidopa, and can cause a reduction in the bioavailability of DUOPA. If iron salts or multi-vitamins containing iron salts are co-administered with DUOPA, monitor patients for worsening Parkinson's symptoms. 7.5 High-Protein Diet Because levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be decreased in patients on a high-protein diet. Advise patients that a high-protein diet may reduce the effectiveness of DUOPA."$$

The most frequent causes of discontinuation in decreasing order are: psychiatric reasons (2% vs. 1%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), dyskinesia/hyperkinesia (2% vs. 1%), nausea (2% vs. 1%), abdominal pain (1% vs. 0%), and aggravation of Parkinson's disease symptoms (1% vs. 1%). Adverse Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies of Entacapone Table 5 lists treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with entacapone participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and that were numerically more common in the entacapone group, compared to placebo. In these studies, either entacapone or placebo was added to carbidopa-levodopa (or benserazide-levodopa).

Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures do, however, provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse events observed in the population studied. Effects of Gender and Age on Adverse Reactions No differences were noted in the rate of adverse events attributable to entacapone alone by age or gender."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials, patients predominantly with moderate to severe motor fluctuations while on carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release were randomized to therapy with either carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release or carbidopa and levodopa extended-release.

"Drug Interactions Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when carbidopa and levodopa preparations were added to the treatment of patients receiving some antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required. For patients receiving MAO inhibitors (Type A or B), see CONTRAINDICATIONS. Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa and levodopa preparations. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Use of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release with dopamine-depleting agents (e.g., reserpine and tetrabenazine) or other drugs known to deplete monoamine stores is not recommended. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release and iron salts or multivitamins containing iron salts should be coadministered with caution. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa and consequently reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa. Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties."$$
