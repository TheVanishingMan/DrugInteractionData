"ADVERSE REACTIONS Local reactions consisting of pain, urticaria or ulceration may occur at the site of injection. A permanent discoloration may remain along the path of the sclerosed vein segment. Sloughing and necrosis of tissue may occur following extravasation of the drug. (See WARNINGS section.) Allergic reactions such as hives, asthma, hay fever and anaphylactic shock have been reported. Mild systemic reactions that have been reported include headache, nausea and vomiting. (See WARNINGS section.) At least six deaths have been reported with the use of Sotradecol. Four cases of anaphylactic shock leading to death have been reported in patients who received Sotradecol. One of these four patients reported a history of asthma, a contraindication to the administration of Sotradecol. (See WARNINGS section.) One death has been reported in a patient who received Sotradecol and who had been receiving an antiovulatory agent. Another death (fatal pulmonary embolism) has been reported in a 36-year-old female treated with sodium tetradecyl acetate and who was not taking oral contraceptives."$$
"DRUG INTERACTIONS No well-controlled studies have been performed on patients taking antiovulatory agents. The physician must use judgment and evaluate any patient taking antiovulatory drugs prior to initiating treatment with Sotradecol. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Heparin should not be included in the same syringe as Sotradecol, since the two are incompatible."$$
