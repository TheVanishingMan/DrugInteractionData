Rare instances of deliberate or accidental overdose have resulted in death. OVERDOSAGE Overdose may result in death. The drug is chemically related to tetracaine and other topical anesthetics and shares various aspects of their pharmacology and toxicology. Drugs of this type are generally well absorbed after ingestion. Signs and Symptoms: If capsules are chewed or dissolved in the mouth, oropharyngeal anesthesia will develop rapidly. CNS stimulation may cause restlessness and tremors, which may proceed to clonic convulsions followed by profound CNS depression. Treatment: Evacuate gastric contents and administer copious amounts of activated charcoal slurry. Even in the conscious patient, cough and gag refluxes may be so depressed as to necessitate special attention to protection against aspiration of gastric contents and orally administered materials. Convulsions should be treated with a short-acting barbiturates given intravenously and carefully titrated for the smallest effective dosage. Intensive support of respiration and cardiovascular-renal function is an essential feature of the treatment of severe intoxication from overdosage. Do not use CNS stimulants."$$
