"ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse reactions incidences listed below are based on observations of 1) 4,784 RIDAURA treated patients in clinical trials (2,474 U.S., 2,310 foreign), of whom 2,729 were treated more than one year and 573 for more than three years; and 2) postmarketing experience. The highest incidence is during the first six months of treatment; however, reactions can occur after many months of therapy. With rare exceptions, all patients were on concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy; some of them were also taking low dosages of corticosteroids.

Dermatological: rash (24%); pruritus (17%); hair loss; urticaria. Mucous Membrane: stomatitis (13%); conjunctivitis*; glossitis. Hematological: anemia; leukopenia; thrombocytopenia; eosinophilia. Renal: proteinuria*; hematuria. Hepatic: elevated liver enzymes. *Reactions marked with an asterisk occurred in 3-9% of the patients. The other reactions listed occurred in 1-3%.

"Drug Interactions: In a single patient-report, there is the suggestion that concurrent administration of RIDAURA and phenytoin may have increased phenytoin blood levels."$$
