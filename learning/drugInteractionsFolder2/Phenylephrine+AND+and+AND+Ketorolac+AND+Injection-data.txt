( 5.1) 5.1 Elevated Blood Pressure Systemic exposure of phenylephrine can cause elevations in blood pressure. 5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). There have been reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac in patients who either have a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/NSAIDs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, use Omidria with caution in individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs."$$

Table 1 shows frequently reported ocular adverse reactions with an incidence of >= 2% of subjects as seen in the combined clinical trial results from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies.
