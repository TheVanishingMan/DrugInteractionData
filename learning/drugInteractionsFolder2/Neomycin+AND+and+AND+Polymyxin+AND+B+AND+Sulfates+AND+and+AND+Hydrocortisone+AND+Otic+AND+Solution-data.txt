"ADVERSE REACTIONS: Neomycin occasionally causes skin sensitization. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have also been reported (see ). Adverse reactions have occurred with topical use of antibiotic combinations including neomycin and polymyxin B. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available. The reaction occurring most often is allergic sensitization. In one clinical study, using a 20% neomycin patch, neomycin-induced allergic skin reactions occurred in two of 2,175 (0.09%) individuals in the general population. In another study, the incidence was found to be approximately 1%.
