"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue DITROPAN XL(R) immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of DITROPAN XL(R). (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), Parkinson's disease (5.2), Myasthenia gravis (5.3), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how DITROPAN XL(R) affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. DITROPAN XL(R) should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. DITROPAN XL(R) should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis DITROPAN XL(R) should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy DITROPAN XL(R) should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention DITROPAN XL(R) should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions DITROPAN XL(R) should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. DITROPAN XL(R), like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. DITROPAN XL(R) should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering DITROPAN XL(R) to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."$$

A subset of these 789 patients (N=216) participated in the 14-week open-label safety extension that followed the placebo-controlled study. Of 216 patients in the safety extension, 107 were randomized to placebo gel during the double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. In the combined double-blind, placebo-controlled study and the open-label safety extension, a total of 496 patients were exposed to at least one dose of GELNIQUE. Four hundred thirty-one (431) patients received at least 12 weeks of GELNIQUE treatment and 85 patients received 26 weeks of GELNIQUE treatment. The study population primarily consisted of Caucasian women (approximately 90%) with an average age of 59 years who had overactive bladder with urge urinary incontinence. Table 1 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than 2% of patients treated with GELNIQUE. Table 1: Common Adverse Events in the Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled 12-Week Study (>2% and > placebo) Adverse Event GELNIQUE 1 gram N=389 n (%) Placebo N=400 n (%) * Includes application site pruritus, dermatitis, papules, anesthesia, erythema, irritation, pain and papules Dry mouth 29 (7.5) 11 (2.8) Urinary tract infection 27 (6.9) 17 (4.3) Application site reactions* 21 (5.4) 4 (1.0) Upper respiratory tract infection 21 (5.4) 20 (5.0) Dizziness 11 (2.8) 4 (1.0) Nasopharyngitis 11 (2.8) 9 (2.3) Fatigue 8 (2.1) 4 (1.0) Gastroenteritis viral 8 (2.1) 7 (1.8) The most common adverse reactions, defined as adverse events judged by the investigator to be reasonably associated with the use of study drug, that were reported in >= 1% of GELNIQUE-treated patients were dry mouth (6.9%), application site reactions (5.4%), dizziness (1.5%), headache (1.5%), constipation (1.3%), and pruritus (1.3%). Application site pruritus (2.1%) and application site dermatitis (1.8%) were the most commonly reported application site reactions. A majority of treatment-related adverse events were described as mild or moderate in intensity, except for two patients reporting severe headache. No serious adverse events were judged by the investigator to be treatment-related during the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study. The most common adverse reaction leading to drug discontinuation was application site reaction (0.8% with GELNIQUE versus 0.3% with placebo). The most common adverse reactions reported during the 14-week open-label extension study were application site reactions (6.0%) and dry mouth (1.9%). The most common reason for premature discontinuation was application site reactions (9 patients or 4.2%). Two of these 9 patients experienced application site reactions of severe intensity (dermatitis, urticaria, and erythema)."$$

The safety of OXYTROL was evaluated in a total of 417 patients who participated in two clinical efficacy and safety studies and an open-label extension. Additional safety information was collected in earlier phase trials. In the two pivotal studies, a total of 246 patients received OXYTROL during the 12-week treatment periods. A total of 411 patients entered the open-label extension and of those, 65 patients and 52 patients received OXYTROL for at least 24 weeks and at least 36 weeks, respectively. No deaths were reported during treatment. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported. Adverse reactions reported in the pivotal trials are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 below.

Severe application site reactions were reported by 6.4% of OXYTROL-treated patients in Study 1 and by 5.0% of OXYTROL-treated patients in Study 2. Adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation were reported by 11.2% of OXYTROL-treated patients in Study 1 and 10.7% of OXYTROL-treated patients in Study 2. Most of these discontinuations were due to application site reaction. In the two pivotal studies, no patient discontinued OXYTROL treatment due to dry mouth. In the open-label extension, the most common treatment-related adverse reactions were: application site pruritus, application site erythema, and dry mouth. In a controlled clinical trial of skin sensitization, none of the 103 test subjects demonstrated skin hypersensitivity to OXYTROL. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of OXYTROL.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 580 participants who received Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in 4 clinical trials (429 patients), and four pharmacokinetic studies (151 healthy volunteers). The 429 patients were treated with 5-30 mg/day for up to 4.5 months. Three of the 4 clinical trials allowed dose adjustments based on efficacy and adverse events and one was a fixed dose escalation design. Safety information is provided for 429 patients from these three controlled clinical studies and one open label study in the first column of Table 3 below. Adverse reactions from two additional fixed dose, active controlled, 12 week treatment duration, postmarketing studies, in which 576 patients were treated with Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg/day, are also listed in Table 3 (second column).

"Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects.

"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2) Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis: Use with caution in Myasthenia gravis patients due to risk of symptom aggravation ( 5.3) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( 5.4) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( 5.5) Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."$$
