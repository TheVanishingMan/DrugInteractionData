"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Pulmonary edema: Discontinue therapy if pulmonary edema occurs. (5.1) -Rebound pulmonary hypertension: Do not abruptly discontinue or decrease the dose. (5.2) -Vasodilation reactions: Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change. (5.3) -Increased risk for bleeding: Increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding. (5.4) 5.1 Pulmonary Edema If the patient develops pulmonary edema during initiation with FLOLAN, discontinue therapy and do not readminister. Consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in such patients. 5.2 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension following Abrupt Withdrawal Avoid abrupt withdrawal (including interruptions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in dosage of FLOLAN because symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension (e.g., dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia) may occur. In clinical trials, one Class III patient's death was judged attributable to the interruption of FLOLAN. 5.3 Vasodilation FLOLAN is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator and can cause hypotension and other reactions such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Increased Risk for Bleeding FLOLAN is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Therefore, expect an increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS VELETRI should be used only by clinicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. (5.1) Reconstitute only as directed, with Sterile Water for Injection or Sodium Chloride 0.9% Injection.(5.1) Do not abruptly lower the dose or withdraw dosing. All dosing initiation and changes should be closely monitored. (5.3, 5.4) 5.1 General Reconstitute VELETRI only as directed using Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Sodium Chloride 0.9% Injection, USP. Do not mix VELETRI with any other parenteral medications or solutions prior to or during administration. VELETRI should be used only by clinicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Carefully establish the diagnosis of idiopathic or heritable PAH or PAH/CTD. 5.2 Dose Initiation VELETRI is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. Initiate VELETRI in a setting with adequate personnel and equipment for physiologic monitoring and emergency care. Dose initiation has been performed during right heart catheterization and without cardiac catheterization. During dose initiation, asymptomatic increases in pulmonary artery pressure coincident with increases in cardiac output occurred rarely. In such cases, consider dose reduction, but such an increase does not imply that chronic treatment is contraindicated. 5.3 Chronic Use and Dose Adjustment During chronic use, deliver VELETRI continuously on an ambulatory basis through a permanent indwelling central venous catheter. Unless contraindicated, administer anticoagulant therapy to patients receiving VELETRI to reduce the risk of pulmonary thromboembolism or systemic embolism through a patent foramen ovale. To reduce the risk of infection, use aseptic technique in the reconstitution and administration of VELETRI and in routine catheter care. Because epoprostenol is metabolized rapidly, even brief interruptions in the delivery of VELETRI may result in symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension including dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia. Intravenous therapy with VELETRI will likely be needed for prolonged periods, possibly years, so consider the patient's capacity to accept and care for a permanent intravenous catheter and infusion pump. Based on clinical trials, the acute hemodynamic response (reduction in pulmonary artery resistance) to epoprostenol did not correlate well with improvement in exercise tolerance or survival during chronic use of epoprostenol. Adjust dosage of VELETRI during chronic use at the first sign of recurrence or worsening of symptoms attributable to pulmonary hypertension or the occurrence of adverse events associated with epoprostenol [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Following dosage adjustments, monitor standing and supine blood pressure and heart rate closely for several hours. 5.4 Withdrawal Effects Abrupt withdrawal (including interruptions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in dosage of VELETRI may result in symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension, including dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia. In clinical trials, one Class III primary pulmonary hypertension patient's death was judged attributable to the interruption of epoprostenol. Avoid abrupt withdrawal. 5.5 Sepsis See Adverse Reactions (6.1)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during: -Dose Initiation and Escalation: Nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, flushing, chest pain, anxiety, dizziness, bradycardia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and tachycardia (6.1) -Chronic Dosing: Headache, jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, flu-like symptoms, and anxiety/nervousness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, please contact: ACTELION at 1-866-228-3546 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, adverse events were classified as follows: (1) adverse events during dose initiation and escalation, (2) adverse events during chronic dosing, and (3) adverse events associated with the drug delivery system. Adverse Events during Dose Initiation and Escalation During early clinical trials, epoprostenol was increased in 2-ng/kg/min increments until the patients developed symptomatic intolerance. The most common adverse events and the adverse events that limited further increases in dose were generally related to vasodilation, the major pharmacologic effect of epoprostenol. The most common dose-limiting adverse events (occurring in >=1% of patients) were nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, and flushing, but also include chest pain, anxiety, dizziness, bradycardia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and tachycardia. Table 8 lists the adverse events reported during dose initiation and escalation in decreasing order of frequency. Table 8: Adverse Events during Dose Initiation and Escalation Adverse Events Occurring in >=1% of Patients Epoprostenol (n = 391) Flushing 58% Headache 49% Nausea/vomiting 32% Hypotension 16% Anxiety, nervousness, agitation 11% Chest pain 11% Dizziness 8% Bradycardia 5% Abdominal pain 5% Musculoskeletal pain 3% Dyspnea 2% Back pain 2% Sweating 1% Dyspepsia 1% Hypesthesia/paresthesia 1% Tachycardia 1% Adverse Events during Chronic Administration: Interpretation of adverse events is complicated by the clinical features of PAH, which are similar to some of the pharmacologic effects of epoprostenol (e.g., dizziness, syncope). Adverse events which may be related to the underlying disease include dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, edema, hypoxia, right ventricular failure, and pallor. Several adverse events, on the other hand, can clearly be attributed to epoprostenol. These include hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, bleeding at various sites, thrombocytopenia, headache, abdominal pain, pain (unspecified), sweating, rash, arthralgia, jaw pain, flushing, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, flu-like symptoms, anxiety/nervousness, and agitation. In addition, chest pain, fatigue, and pallor have been reported during epoprostenol therapy, and a role for the drug in these events cannot be excluded. Adverse Events during Chronic Administration for Idiopathic or Heritable PAH: In an effort to separate the adverse effects of the drug from the adverse effects of the underlying disease, Table 9 lists adverse events that occurred at a rate at least 10% greater on epoprostenol than on conventional therapy in controlled trials for idiopathic or heritable PAH. Table 9: Adverse Events Regardless of Attribution Occurring in Patients with Idiopathic or Heritable PAH with >= 10% Difference between Epoprostenol and Conventional Therapy Alone Adverse Event Epoprostenol (n = 52) Conventional Therapy (n = 54) Occurrence More Common With Epoprostenol General Chills/fever/sepsis/flu-like symptoms 25% 11% Cardiovascular Tachycardia 35% 24% Flushing 42% 2% Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 37% 6% Nausea/vomiting 67% 48% Musculoskeletal Jaw pain 54% 0% Myalgia 44% 31% Nonspecific musculoskeletal pain 35% 15% Neurological Anxiety/nervousness/tremor 21% 9% Dizziness 83% 70% Headache 83% 33% Hypesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia 12% 2% Thrombocytopenia has been reported during uncontrolled clinical trials in patients receiving epoprostenol.

Adverse Events Attributable to the Drug Delivery System Chronic infusions of epoprostenol are delivered using a small, portable infusion pump through an indwelling central venous catheter. During controlled PAH trials of up to 12 weeks' duration, the local infection rate was about 18%, and the rate for pain was about 11%. During long-term follow-up, sepsis was reported at a rate of 0.3 infections/patient per year in patients treated with epoprostenol. This rate was higher than reported in patients using chronic indwelling central venous catheters to administer parenteral nutrition, but lower than reported in oncology patients using these catheters. Malfunctions in the delivery system resulting in an inadvertent bolus of or a reduction in epoprostenol were associated with symptoms related to excess or insufficient epoprostenol, respectively. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of epoprostenol. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to epoprostenol.

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when VELETRI is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators. When other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for VELETRI to increase the risk of bleeding. However, patients receiving infusions of epoprostenol in clinical trials were maintained on anticoagulants without evidence of increased bleeding. In clinical trials, epoprostenol was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen. In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or digoxin in whom therapy with epoprostenol was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87. The change in furosemide clearance value is not likely to be clinically significant. However, patients on digoxin may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with epoprostenol, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
