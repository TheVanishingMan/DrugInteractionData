"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid coadministration with other antiretroviral products: Do not use with drugs containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, ritonavir, or adefovir dipivoxil. (5.3) Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.4) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assess creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients before initiating GENVOYA therapy and monitor during therapy. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (5.7) Bone loss and mineralization defects: Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with GENVOYA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations) [see Boxed Warning]. 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. GENVOYA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of GENVOYA have not been established in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or TDF, and may occur with GENVOYA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue GENVOYA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure [see Boxed Warning]. 5.3 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products Coadministration of GENVOYA with other antiretroviral products is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. GENVOYA is not recommended for coadministration with drugs that contain any of the following: elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, ritonavir. 5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during GENVOYA therapy; review concomitant medications during GENVOYA therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution or accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \\\\"cushingoid appearance\\\\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including emtricitabine, a component of GENVOYA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of GENVOYA, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of GENVOYA in treatment naive subjects and in virally suppressed subjects switched to GENVOYA with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events or discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with GENVOYA. In a study of virally suppressed subjects with baseline eGFRs between 30 and 69 mL per minute treated with GENVOYA for a median duration of 43 weeks, GENVOYA was permanently discontinued due to worsening renal function in two of 80 (3%) subjects with a baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL per minute [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. GENVOYA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute because data in this population are insufficient. Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein should be assessed before initiating GENVOYA therapy and should be monitored during therapy in all patients. Serum phosphorus should be monitored in patients with chronic kidney disease because these patients are at greater risk of developing Fanconi syndrome on tenofovir prodrugs. Discontinue GENVOYA in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Cobicistat, a component of GENVOYA, produces elevations of serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The elevation is typically seen within 2 weeks of starting therapy and is reversible after discontinuation. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.8 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects Bone Mineral Density (BMD): In animal toxicology studies and human clinical trials, TAF and tenofovir have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism suggestive of increased bone turnover. In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected treatment-naive adults, a significant decline in bone mineral density was observed in 15% of subjects treated with GENVOYA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The long-term clinical significance of these changes has not been established. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults and pediatric patients treated with GENVOYA who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of TDF-containing products. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy have occurred in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. While not observed in clinical studies of GENVOYA, the risk of osteomalacia with GENVOYA is not known."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Do not use with protease inhibitors coadministered with cobicistat. (5.2) Do not use with other elvitegravir-containing drugs, including STRIBILD. (5.2) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.3) 5.1 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of VITEKTA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Drug Interactions (7)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of VITEKTA and possible development of resistance Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs or elvitegravir. See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during VITEKTA therapy; review concomitant medications during VITEKTA therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.2 Use with Other Antiretroviral Agents Use of VITEKTA in combination with the fixed dose combination STRIBILD is not recommended, because elvitegravir is a component of STRIBILD. VITEKTA is indicated for use in combination with a protease inhibitor coadministered with ritonavir and with other antiretroviral drug(s). VITEKTA in combination with a protease inhibitor and cobicistat is not recommended because dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and may result in suboptimal plasma concentrations of VITEKTA and/or the protease inhibitor, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. 5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr), urine glucose, and urine protein before initiating treatment with STRIBILD. Monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Avoid coadministration with other antiretroviral products: Do not use with products containing any of the components of STRIBILD (cobicistat, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, TYBOST, VIREAD, or VITEKTA; with drugs containing lamivudine; or with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.5) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.6) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA(R), the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701), 8 (2.3%) subjects in the atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=355), and no subjects in the ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=352) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group occurred during the first 48 weeks. Four (0.6%) subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD during the first 48 weeks of treatment. Two of the four subjects had renal impairment (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. One (0.3%) subject who received ATV+RTV+TRUVADA developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA after Week 96. STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [See Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be documented in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. Routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be performed during STRIBILD therapy in all patients. Additionally, serum phosphorus should be measured in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet. 5.4 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products STRIBILD is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, and coadministration with other antiretroviral products is not recommended. STRIBILD is not recommended for coadministration with the following: cobicistat (TYBOST(R)) elvitegravir (VITEKTA(R)) products containing emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, VIREAD(R)) products containing lamivudine (Combivir, Epivir, Epivir-HBV, Epzicom, Triumeq, Trizivir) adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA(R)) products containing ritonavir (Norvir, Kaletra). 5.5 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [See Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [See Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during STRIBILD therapy; review concomitant medications during STRIBILD therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.6 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density In clinical trials in HIV-1-infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1.25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1-infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \\\\"cushingoid appearance\\\\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."$$

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Treatment Naive Adults The primary safety assessment of GENVOYA was based on Week 48 pooled data from 1733 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Study 104 and Study 111, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects. A total of 866 subjects received one tablet of GENVOYA once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most common adverse reaction (all Grades) reported in at least 10% of subjects in the GENVOYA group was nausea. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with GENVOYA or STRIBILD(R) due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 5% in the GENVOYA group. Table 2 Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all adverse events attributed to study drugs by the investigator. (All Grades) Reported in >= 5% of HIV-1 Infected Treatment Naive Adults Receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 (Week 48 analysis) GENVOYA N=866 STRIBILD N=867 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Diarrhea 7% 9% Nausea 10% 13% GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Fatigue 5% 4% NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Headache 6% 5% The majority of events presented in Table 2 occurred at severity Grade 1. Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of GENVOYA in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 959 subjects in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 109) in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from a TDF-containing combination regimen to GENVOYA one tablet taken orally once daily. Overall, the safety profile of GENVOYA in subjects in this study was similar to that of treatment naive subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects with Renal Impairment In an open-label trial (Study 112), 248 HIV-1 infected subjects with eGFR of 30 to 69 mL per minute (by Cockcroft-Gault method) were treated with GENVOYA for a median duration of 43 weeks. Of these subjects, 64% had previously been on a stable TDF-containing regimen. Among the 80 subjects with baseline eGFR less than 50 mL per minute receiving GENVOYA, two subjects developed worsening renal impairment and discontinued treatment. One subject with an eGFR over 50 mL per minute developed transient acute renal failure. Otherwise, the safety profile of GENVOYA in subjects in this study was similar to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Renal Laboratory Tests Treatment Naive Adults: In two 48-week randomized, controlled trials in a total of 1733 treatment naive adults with a median baseline eGFR of 115 mL per minute, mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL in the GENVOYA and STRIBILD groups from baseline to Week 48. Median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 44 mg per gram at baseline and at Week 48 in the GENVOYA group. Median UPCR was 44 mg per gram at baseline and 55 mg per gram at Week 48 in those receiving STRIBILD. Virologically Suppressed Adults: In a study of 1436 virologically-suppressed TDF-treated adults with a mean baseline eGFR of 112 mL per minute who were randomized to continue their treatment regimen or switch to GENVOYA, at Week 48 mean serum creatinine was similar to baseline for both those continuing baseline treatment and those switching to GENVOYA. Median UPCR was 61 mg per gram at baseline and 46 mg per gram at Week 48 in subjects switching to GENVOYA. In subjects remaining on their initial regimen, UPCR was 60 mg per gram at baseline and 63 mg per gram at Week 48. Adult Subjects with Renal Impairment: In a 24-week trial in 248 subjects with renal impairment (baseline eGFR 30 to 69 mL per minute) who received GENVOYA, mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg per dL at both baseline and Week 24. Median UPCR was 161 mg per gram at baseline and 93 mg per gram at Week 24. Bone Mineral Density Effects Treatment Naive Adults: In the pooled analysis of Studies 104 and 111, bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to compare the bone safety of TAF to that of TDF when administered as GENVOYA or STRIBILD, respectively. Mean BMD decreased from baseline to Week 48 -1.30% with GENVOYA compared to -2.86% with STRIBILD at the lumbar spine and -0.66% compared to -2.95% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 10% of GENVOYA subjects and 22% of STRIBILD subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 7% of GENVOYA subjects and 19% of STRIBILD subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known. Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 7 (0.8%) subjects in the GENVOYA group and 12 (1.4%) subjects in the STRIBILD group through 48 weeks. Virologically Suppressed Adults: In Study 109, TDF-treated subjects were randomized to continue their TDF-based regimen or switch to GENVOYA; changes in BMD from baseline to Week 48 were assessed by DXA. Mean BMD increased in subjects who switched to GENVOYA (1.86% lumbar spine, 1.95% total hip) and decreased slightly in subjects who continued their baseline regimen (-0.11% lumbar spine, -0.14% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1% of GENVOYA subjects and 6% of subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 1% of GENVOYA subjects and 4% of subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen. Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 10 (1%) subjects who switched to GENVOYA and 2 (0.4%) subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen through 48 weeks. Laboratory Abnormalities: The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3-4) Reported in >= 2% of Subjects Receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 (Week 48 analysis) Laboratory Parameter AbnormalityFrequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities.

The safety profile in 23 adolescent subjects who received treatment with GENVOYA was similar to that in adults. One 13 year old female subject developed unexplained uveitis while receiving GENVOYA that resolved and did not require discontinuation of GENVOYA. Among the 23 pediatric subjects receiving GENVOYA for 24 weeks, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 24, + 1.7% at the lumbar spine and + 0.8% for the total body less head. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.10 for lumbar spine and -0.11 for total body less head at Week 24. Two GENVOYA subjects had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 24."$$

Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Most common adverse drug reactions to STRIBILD (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) are nausea and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily for at least 96 weeks. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg); ATRIPLA (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg); or atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 4.6%, 6.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse drug reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm. Table 2 Adverse Drug ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, attributed to study drugs.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving STRIBILD in Studies 102 and 103 are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3-4) Reported in >= 2% of Subjects Receiving STRIBILD in Studies 102 and 103 (Week 96 analysis) STRIBILD ATRIPLA ATV + RTV + TRUVADA Laboratory Parameter Abnormality Frequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. , For subjects with serum amylase > 1.5 \\303\\227 upper limit of normal, lipase test was also performed. The frequency of increased lipase (Grades 3-4) occurring in STRIBILD (N=61), ATRIPLA (N=36), and ATV +RTV + TRUVADA (N=36) was 15%, 17%, and 25%, respectively.

Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 96 in the STRIBILD group (N = 47) were comparable to the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group (N = 53) at the lumbar spine (-2.0% versus -3.5%, respectively) and at the hip (-3.2% versus -4.2%, respectively). In Studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 14 subjects (2.0%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 14 subjects (3.9%) in the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-naive subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz. Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 46% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 38% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 37% of subjects receiving ATV + RTV + TRUVADA. The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In Studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which they stabilized. Table 4 displays the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels at Week 96 and the percentage of subjects with elevations in serum creatinine (All Grades).

Serum Lipids: In the clinical trials of STRIBILD, a similar percentage of subjects receiving STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, and ATV + RTV + TRUVADA were on lipid lowering agents at baseline (11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively). While receiving study drug through Week 96, an additional 8% of STRIBILD subjects were started on lipid lowering agents, compared to 9% of ATRIPLA and 8% of ATV + RTV + TRUVADA subjects. Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 5.

In HIV-1-Infected Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week-144 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1-infected adult subjects [See Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily in these two studies. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, or ATV+RTV+TRUVADA due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 6.0%, 7.4%, and 8.5%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm. Table 2 Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events attributed to study drugs.

Additional adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD included suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (0.3%), all in subjects with a preexisting history of depression or psychiatric illness. In Virologically Suppressed HIV-1-Infected Subjects No new adverse reactions to STRIBILD through Week 48 were identified in 584 virologically stably suppressed subjects switching to STRIBILD from a regimen containing a RTV-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). In a combined analysis of studies 115 and 121, the frequency of adverse reactions (all grades) was 24% in subjects switching to STRIBILD compared to 6% of subjects in either group who stayed on their baseline antiretroviral regimen, RTV-boosted PI+TRUVADA or NNRTI+TRUVADA. Common adverse reactions that occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects switching to STRIBILD were nausea (4%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, the RTV-boosted PI, or the NNRTI due to adverse events was 2%, 3%, and 1%, respectively. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3\\342\\210\\2224) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving STRIBILD in studies 102 and 103 are presented in Table 3.

Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 144 in the STRIBILD group were comparable to that in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group at the lumbar spine (\\342\\210\\2221.43% versus \\342\\210\\2223.68%, respectively) and at the hip (\\342\\210\\2222.83% versus \\342\\210\\2223.77%, respectively). In studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 27 subjects (3.9%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 19 subjects (5.4%) in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-naive subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz. Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 52% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 41% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 42% of subjects receiving ATV+RTV+TRUVADA. The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which levels stabilized.

The safety assessment of VITEKTA is primarily based on data from a controlled clinical trial, Study 145, in which 712 HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-experienced adults received VITEKTA (N=354) or raltegravir (N=358), each administered with a background regimen consisting of a fully active protease inhibitor coadministered with ritonavir and with other antiretroviral drug(s) for at least 96 weeks. The proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 3% in the VITEKTA group and 4% in the raltegravir group. The most common adverse reaction (all Grades, incidence greater than or equal to 5%) in subjects receiving VITEKTA in Study 145 was diarrhea.

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS GENVOYA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. (5.3, 7.1) GENVOYA can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of one or more components of GENVOYA. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications GENVOYA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, coadministration of GENVOYA with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection should be avoided. Complete information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided [see Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Potential for GENVOYA to Affect Other Drugs Cobicistat, a component of GENVOYA, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of the following transporters: p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Thus, coadministration of GENVOYA with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs (see Table 5). Elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP2C9 substrates. TAF is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or UGT1A1. TAF is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect One or More Components of GENVOYA Elvitegravir and cobicistat, components of GENVOYA, are metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is also metabolized, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir and cobicistat, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat, elvitegravir, and TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and development of resistance (see Table 5). Coadministration of GENVOYA with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance and increase the plasma concentration of cobicistat (see Table 5). TAF, a component of GENVOYA, is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP, such as cobicistat, may increase the absorption of TAF (see Table 10). However, when TAF is administered as a component of GENVOYA, its availability is increased by cobicistat and a further increase of TAF concentrations is not expected upon coadministration of an additional P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitor. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of GENVOYA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions Table 5 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either GENVOYA, the components of GENVOYA (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide) as individual agents and/or in combination, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with GENVOYA [for magnitude of interaction, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The table includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive. Table 5 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive.

Antifungals: itraconazole ketoconazole voriconazole | elvitegravir | cobicistat | itraconazole | ketoconazole | voriconazole When administering with GENVOYA, the maximum daily dosage of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg per day. An assessment of benefit/risk ratio is recommended to justify use of voriconazole with GENVOYA. Anti-gout: colchicine | colchicine GENVOYA is not recommended to be coadministered with colchicine to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Treatment of gout-flares - coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) \\303\\227 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. Prophylaxis of gout-flares - coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever - coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: Maximum daily dosage of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day). Antimycobacterial: rifabutin rifapentine | elvitegravir | cobicistat | TAF Coadministration of GENVOYA with rifabutin or rifapentine is not recommended. Antipsychotics: quetiapine | quetiapine Initiation of GENVOYA in patients taking quetiapine: Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposure. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring. Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking GENVOYA: Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. Benzodiazepines: e.g., Parenterally administered midazolam clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam lorazepam | diazepam \\342\\206\\224 lorazepam | midazolam Coadministration of GENVOYA with diazepam or parenterally administered midazolam should be done in a setting that ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Based on non-CYP-mediated elimination pathways for lorazepam, no effect on plasma concentrations is expected upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Beta-Blockers: e.g., metoprolol timolol | beta-blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dosage decrease of the beta blocker may be necessary when these agents are coadministered with GENVOYA. Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g., amlodipine diltiazem felodipine nicardipine nifedipine verapamil | calcium channel blockers Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration of calcium channel blockers with GENVOYA.

HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin | atorvastatin Initiate with the lowest starting dose of atorvastatin and titrate carefully while monitoring for safety. Hormonal Contraceptives: norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol | norgestimate | ethinyl estradiol The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with GENVOYA should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. The effect of GENVOYA on other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate is not known; therefore, alternative (non-hormonal) methods of contraception can be considered. Immuno-suppressants: e.g., cyclosporine (CsA) sirolimus tacrolimus | immuno-suppressants | elvitegravir (with CsA) | cobicistat (with CsA) Therapeutic monitoring of the immunosuppressive agents is recommended upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Monitor for adverse events associated with GENVOYA when coadministered with cyclosporine. Narcotic Analgesics: buprenorphine/naloxone | buprenorphine | norbuprenorphine | naloxone No dosage adjustment of buprenorphine/naloxone is required upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects. Inhaled Beta Agonist: salmeterol | salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol and GENVOYA is not recommended. Coadministration of salmeterol with GENVOYA may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia. Neuroleptics: e.g., perphenazine risperidone thioridazine | neuroleptics A decrease in dosage of the neuroleptic may be needed when coadministered with GENVOYA. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitors: sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil | PDE5 inhibitors Coadministration with GENVOYA may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of tadalafil with GENVOYA: Coadministration of tadalafil in patients on GENVOYA: In patients receiving GENVOYA for at least 1 week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of GENVOYA in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of GENVOYA. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting GENVOYA. After at least one week following initiation of GENVOYA, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor associated with adverse events. Sedative/hypnotics: buspirone zolpidem | sedatives/hypnotics With sedative/hypnotics, dose reduction may be necessary and clinical monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with GENVOYA Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of GENVOYA, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when GENVOYA is combined with the following drugs: entecavir, famciclovir, H2 receptor antagonists, ledipasvir, lorazepam, methadone, proton pump inhibitors, ribavirin, sertraline, and sofosbuvir.",$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. (5.4, 7.1) STRIBILD can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of one or more components of STRIBILD. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Complete information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. 7.2 Potential for STRIBILD to Affect Other Drugs Cobicistat, a component of STRIBILD, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of the following transporters: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Thus, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3, may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs. Elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP2C9 substrates. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect One or More Components of STRIBILD Elvitegravir and cobicistat, components of STRIBILD, are metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is also metabolized, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir and cobicistat, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat and elvitegravir, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and development of resistance (See Table 6). Coadministration of STRIBILD with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance and increase the plasma concentration of cobicistat (See Table 6). 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of STRIBILD, are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions.

Hormonal Contraceptives: norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol | norgestimate | ethinyl estradiol The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with STRIBILD should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. Coadministration of STRIBILD with other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied; therefore, alternative (non-hormonal) methods of contraception can be considered. Immuno-suppressants: e.g. cyclosporine sirolimus tacrolimus | immuno-suppressants Concentrations of these immunosuppressant agents may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Therapeutic monitoring of the immunosuppressive agents is recommended upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Narcotic Analgesics: buprenorphine/ naloxone | buprenorphine | norbuprenorphine | naloxone Concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. No dose adjustment of buprenorphine/naloxone is required upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects. Inhaled Beta Agonist: salmeterol | salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol and STRIBILD is not recommended. Coadministration of salmeterol with STRIBILD may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia. Neuroleptics: e.g. perphenazine risperidone thioridazine | neuroleptics A decrease in dose of the neuroleptic may be needed when coadministered with STRIBILD. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitors: sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil | PDE5 inhibitors Coadministration with STRIBILD may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of tadalafil with STRIBILD: Coadministration of tadalafil in patients on STRIBILD: In patients receiving STRIBILD for at least 1 week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of STRIBILD in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of STRIBILD. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting STRIBILD. After at least one week following initiation of STRIBILD, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor associated with adverse events. Sedative/hypnotics: Benzodiazepines: e.g. Parenterally administered midazolam clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam buspirone zolpidem | sedatives/hypnotics Concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with STRIBILD may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam. Coadministration should be done in a setting that ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Coadministration of oral midazolam with STRIBILD is contraindicated. With other sedative/hypnotics, dose reduction may be necessary and clinical monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with STRIBILD Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of STRIBILD, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when STRIBILD is combined with the following drugs: entecavir, famciclovir, H2 receptor antagonists, methadone, proton pump inhibitors and ribavirin."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). CYP3A Inducers: Can lower the concentrations of elvitegravir leading to loss of therapeutic effect. (7.1) Protease inhibitors and ritonavir: May increase concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A. (7.2) Consult full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (5.1, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Elvitegravir Elvitegravir is metabolized by CYP3A. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir, as well as ritonavir. This may result in decreased plasma concentrations of elvitegravir and/or a concomitantly administered protease inhibitor and lead to loss of therapeutic effect and to possible resistance. 7.2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions Table 4 provides dosing recommendations as a result of potentially clinically significant drug interactions with VITEKTA. These recommendations are based on either drug-drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of therapeutic effect.

"New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr), urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with STRIBILD. Monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Avoid coadministration with other anti-retroviral products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; with drugs containing lamivudine; or with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 96 weeks, 10 (1.4%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701) and 2 (0.3%) subjects in the combined comparator groups (N = 707) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the combined comparator groups occurred during the first 48 week. Four (0.6%) of the subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD compared to none in the comparator groups. Two of these four subjects had renal impairment (i.e. estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects with evidence of proximal tubulopathy improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein should be documented in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be performed during STRIBILD therapy in all patients. Additionally, serum phosphorus should be measured in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet. 5.4 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products STRIBILD is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and coadministration with other antiretroviral products is not recommended. STRIBILD is not recommended for coadministration with the following: emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, VIREAD); products containing lamivudine (COMBIVIR, EPIVIR, EPIVIR-HBV, EPZICOM, TRIZIVIR) or adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA); ritonavir (NORVIR, KALETRA). 5.5 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1.25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1 infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \\\\"cushingoid appearance\\\\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."$$
