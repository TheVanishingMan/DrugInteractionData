"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1.Gastrointestinal adverse reactions may include significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss, and may necessitate treatment interruption. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes (5.1) 2.Discontinue rivastigmine in case of disseminated allergic dermatitis, which may occur after oral or transdermal administration. (4, 5.2) In patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis after transdermal rivastigmine use, switch to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing. 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For this reason, patients should always be started at a dose of 1.5 mg twice a day and titrated to their maintenance dose. If treatment is interrupted for longer than 3 days, treatment should be reinitiated with the lowest daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae (e.g., there has been one postmarketing report of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment with a 4.5-mg dose after 8 weeks of treatment interruption). Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur. It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration. 5.2 Allergic Dermatitis There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral or transdermal). Treatment should be discontinued if disseminated allergic dermatitis occurs [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. In patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine tartrate Patch and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form. 5.3 Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms Cholinomimetics, including rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, particularly tremor, has been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease who were treated with rivastigmine tartrate Capsules. Seizures Drugs that increase cholinergic activity are believed to have some potential for causing seizures. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Peptic Ulcers/Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Monitor patients using rivastigmine tartrate for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity, use of rivastigmine may have vagotonic effects on heart rate (e.g., bradycardia). The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions. In clinical trials, rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, heart rate or blood pressure changes, or ECG abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in 3% of patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day of rivastigmine tartrate, compared to 2% of placebo patients. Genitourinary Effects Although not observed in clinical trials of rivastigmine, drugs that increase cholinergic activity may cause urinary obstruction. Pulmonary Effects Drugs that increase cholinergic activity, including rivastigmine, should be used with care in patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. 5.4 Impairment in Driving or Use of Machinery Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery. The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions. During treatment with the rivastigmine tartrate capsules, routinely evaluate the patient's ability to continue driving or operating machinery."$$

It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form. 5.3 Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Cholinomimetics, including rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, particularly tremor, has been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease who were treated with rivastigmine tartrate capsules. Seizures: Drugs that increase cholinergic activity are believed to have some potential for causing seizures. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Peptic Ulcers/Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Monitor patients using rivastigmine tartrate for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity, use of rivastigmine may have vagotonic effects on heart rate (e.g., bradycardia). The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions. In clinical trials, rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, heart rate or blood pressure changes, or ECG abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in 3% of patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day of rivastigmine tartrate, compared to 2% of placebo patients. Genitourinary Effects Although not observed in clinical trials of rivastigmine, drugs that increase cholinergic activity may cause urinary obstruction. Pulmonary Effects Drugs that increase cholinergic activity, including rivastigmine, should be used with care in patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. 5.4 Impairment in Driving or Use of Machinery Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery. The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions. During treatment with the rivastigmine tartrate, routinely evaluate the patient's ability to continue driving or operating machinery."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastrointestinal adverse reactions: may include significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss, and may necessitate treatment interruption. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. (5.1) Hypersensitivity reactions of the skin: Discontinue rivastigmine in case of disseminated hypersensitivity reaction of the skin, which may occur after oral or transdermal administration. (4, 5.2) In patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis after transdermal rivastigmine use, switch to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing. 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For this reason, patients should always be started at a dose of 1.5 mg twice a day and titrated to their maintenance dose. If treatment is interrupted for longer than 3 days, treatment should be reinitiated with the lowest daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae (e.g., there has been one postmarketing report of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment with a 4.5-mg dose after 8 weeks of treatment interruption). Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur. It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Skin There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated hypersensitivity reactions of the skin when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral or transdermal). Treatment should be discontinued if disseminated hypersensitivity reaction of the skin occurs [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly [see Patient Counseling Information(17)]. In patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine tartrate patch and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hospitalization and, rarely, death have been reported due to application of multiple patches at same time. Ensure patients or caregivers receive instruction on proper dosing and administration. (5.1) -Gastrointestinal adverse reactions: May include significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss, and may necessitate treatment interruption. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. (5.2) -Application site reactions may occur with the patch form of rivastigmine. Discontinue treatment if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g., increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles), and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. (5.3) 5.1 Medication Errors Resulting in Overdose Medication errors with rivastigmine transdermal system have resulted in serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalization, and rarely, led to death. The majority of medication errors have involved not removing the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at one time. Instruct patients and their caregivers on important administration instructions for rivastigmine transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine transdermal system can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For this reason, initiate treatment with rivastigmine transdermal system at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours and titrate to a dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours and then to a dose of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If treatment is interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, reinitiate rivastigmine transdermal system with the 4.6 mg/24 hours dose to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae. A postmarketing report described a case of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment of an oral formulation of rivastigmine without retitration after 8 weeks of treatment interruption. Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur. It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine transdermal system. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitization. However, use of rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these cases, treatment should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients who develop application site reactions to rivastigmine transdermal system suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form. There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral or transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. 5.4 Other Adverse Reactions from Increased Cholinergic Activity Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Cholinomimetics, including rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms.

Rivastigmine tartrate capsules have been administered to over 5,297 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 4,326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3,407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2,150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1,250 patients have been treated for 2 years, and 168 patients have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 mg to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate was 15% for patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on rivastigmine tartrate compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse reactions in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men.

A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients. The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase (43% versus 9% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (17% versus 4% for placebo). **Weight Decreased: In the controlled trials, approximately 26% of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate (greater than 9 mg per day) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight compared to 6% in the placebo-treated patients. About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. ***Anorexia: In the controlled clinical trials, of the patients treated with an rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day, 17% developed anorexia compared to 3% of the placebo patients. Neither the time course nor the severity of the anorexia is known. Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia Rivastigmine tartrate capsules have been administered to 779 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 663 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 476 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, and 313 patients have been treated for 1 year. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18% for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11% for patients on placebo during the 24-week study. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment.

Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to over 5,297 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 4,326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3,407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2,150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1,250 patients have been treated for 2 years, and 168 patients have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 mg to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate was 15% for patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on rivastigmine tartrate compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse reactions in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men.

A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate -treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients. The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase (43% versus 9% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (17% versus 4% for placebo). **Weight Decreased: In the controlled trials, approximately 26% of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate (greater than 9 mg per day) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight compared to 6% in the placebo-treated patients. About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. ***Anorexia: In the controlled clinical trials, of the patients treated with a rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day, 17% developed anorexia compared to 3% of the placebo patients. Neither the time course nor the severity of the anorexia is known. Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to 779 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 663 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 476 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, and 313 patients have been treated for 1 year. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18% for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11% for patients on placebo during the 24-week study. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial.

With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 mg to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate was 15% for patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on rivastigmine tartrate compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. 3 <1 Cardiovascular Disorders, General Hypertension 3 2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Dizziness 21 11 Headache 17 12 Somnolence 5 3 Tremor 4 1 Gastrointestinal System NauseaNausea and Vomiting: In the controlled clinical trials, 47% of the patients treated with a rivastigmine tartrate dose in the therapeutic range of 6 mg to 12 mg per day (n=1189) developed nausea (compared with 12% in placebo). A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients.

Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18% for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11% for patients on placebo during the 24-week study. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial.

In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse reactions in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men. Table 2 Proportion of Adverse Reactions Observed with a Frequency of >=2% and at a Rate Greater than Placebo in Clinical Trials Body System/Adverse Reaction Rivastigmine Tartrate (6 to 12 mg/day) (n=1,189) Placebo (n=868) Percent of Patients with any Adverse Event 92 79 Autonomic Nervous System Increased Sweating 4 1 Syncope 3 2 Body as a Whole Fatigue 9 5 Asthenia 6 2 Malaise 5 2 Decreased WeightWeight Decreased: In the controlled trials, approximately 26% of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate (greater than 9 mg per day) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight compared to 6% in the placebo-treated patients. About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. 3 <1 Cardiovascular Disorders, General Hypertension 3 2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Dizziness 21 11 Headache 17 12 Somnolence 5 3 Tremor 4 1 Gastrointestinal System NauseaNausea and Vomiting: In the controlled clinical trials, 47% of the patients treated with an rivastigmine tartrate dose in the therapeutic range of 6 mg to 12 mg per day (n=1,189) developed nausea (compared with 12% in placebo). A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients. The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase (43% versus 9% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (17% versus 4% for placebo). 47 12 Vomiting 31 6 Diarrhea 19 11 AnorexiaAnorexia: In the controlled clinical trials, of the patients treated with a rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day, 17% developed anorexia compared to 3% of the placebo patients. Neither the time course nor the severity of the anorexia is known. 17 3 Abdominal Pain 13 6 Dyspepsia 9 4 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 9 7 Confusion 8 7 Depression 6 4 Anxiety 5 3 Hallucination 4 3 Aggressive Reaction 3 2 Resistance Mechanism Disorders Urinary Tract Infection 7 6 Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to 779 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 663 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 476 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, and 313 patients have been treated for 1 year. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18% for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11% for patients on placebo during the 24-week study. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment.

Rivastigmine transdermal system has been administered to 4516 patients with Alzheimer's disease during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 3005 patients have been treated for at least 26 weeks, 1771 patients have been treated for at least 52 weeks, 974 patients have been treated for at least 78 weeks and 24 patients have been treated for at least 104 weeks. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease 24-Week International Placebo-Controlled Trial (Study 1) Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients administered rivastigmine transdermal system in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the 9.5 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system arm and at a frequency at higher than in the placebo group, were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These reactions were dose-related, with each being more common in patients using the unapproved 17.4 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system than in those using the 9.5 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system. Discontinuation Rates In Study 1, which randomized a total of 1195 patients, the proportions of patients in the rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours, rivastigmine tartrate capsules 6 mg twice daily, and placebo groups who discontinued treatment due to adverse events were 10%, 8%, and 5%, respectively. The most common adverse reactions in the rivastigmine transdermal system-treated groups that led to treatment discontinuation in this study were nausea and vomiting. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to nausea were 0.7%, 1.7%, and 1.3% in the rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours, rivastigmine tartrate capsules 6 mg twice daily, and placebo groups, respectively. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting were 0%, 2.0%, and 0.3% in the rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours, rivastigmine tartrate capsules 6 mg twice daily, and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of >=2% Table 1 lists adverse reactions seen at an incidence of >=2% in either rivastigmine transdermal system-treated group in Study 1 and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with that dose of rivastigmine transdermal system than for those treated with placebo. The unapproved 17.4 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system arm is included to demonstrate the increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse reactions over those seen with the 9.5 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system.

Body weight was also monitored at prespecified time points throughout the course of the clinical study. The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight was 8% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours, 12% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 17.4 mg/24 hours, 11% of patients who received the rivastigmine tartrate capsule at doses up to 6 mg twice daily and 6% of those who received placebo. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. 48-Week International Active Comparator-Controlled Trial (Study 2) Most Common Adverse Reactions In Study 2 [see Clinical Studies (14)] of the commonly observed adverse reactions (>=3% in any treatment group) the most frequent event in the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours group was nausea, followed by vomiting, fall, weight decreased, application site erythema, decreased appetite, diarrhea and urinary tract infection (Table 3). The percentage of patients with these events was higher in the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours group than in the rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours group. Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite experienced these reactions more often during the first 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase. These reactions decreased over time in each treatment group. Weight decreased was reported to have increased over time in each treatment group. Discontinuation Rates Table 2 displays the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation during the 48-week, double-blind treatment phase in Study 2. Table 2: Proportion of Most Common Adverse Reactions (>1% at Any Dose) Leading to Discontinuation During 48-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase in Study 2 Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours Total Total Patients Studied 280 283 563 Total Percentage of Patients with ARs Leading to Discontinuation (%) 9.6 12.7 11.2 Vomiting 1.4 0.4 0.9 Application site pruritus 1.1 1.1 1.1 Aggression 0.4 1.1 0.7 Most Common Adverse Reactions >=3% Other adverse reactions of interest which occurred less frequently, but which were observed in a markedly higher percentage of patients in the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours group than in the rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours group in Study 2, included dizziness and upper abdominal pain. The percentage of patients with these reactions decreased over time in each treatment group (Table 3). The adverse reaction severity profile was generally similar for both the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours and 9.5 mg/24 hours groups.

Body weight was monitored as a vital sign at pre-specified time points throughout the course of the clinical study. The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight was 15.2% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 9.5 mg/24 hours and 18.6% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours during the 48-week double-blind treatment period. Severe Alzheimer's Disease 24-Week US Controlled Trial (Study 3) Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients administered rivastigmine transdermal system in the controlled clinical trial, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the 13.3 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system arm and at a frequency higher than in the 4.6 mg/24 hours rivastigmine transdermal system were application site erythema, fall, insomnia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight decreased, and nausea (Table 4). Patients in the lower dose group reported more events of agitation, urinary tract infection, and hallucinations than patients in the higher dose group. Discontinuation Rates In Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14)], the proportions of patients in the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours (n=355) and rivastigmine transdermal system 4.6 mg/24 hours (n=359), who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions were 21% and 14%, respectively. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in the 13.3 mg/24 hours treatment group versus the 4.6 mg/24 hours treatment group was agitation (2.8% versus 2.2%), followed by vomiting (2.5% and 1.1%), nausea (1.7% and 1.1%), decreased appetite (1.7% and 0%), aggression (1.1% and 0.3%), fall (1.1% and 0.3%) and syncope (1.1% and 0.3%). Otherwise, all AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in <1% of patients. Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions >=5% Other adverse reactions of interest which were observed in a higher percentage of patients in the rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours group than in the rivastigmine transdermal system 4.6 mg/24 hours group, included application site erythema, fall, insomnia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight decreased, and nausea (Table 4). Overall, the majority of patients in this study experienced adverse reactions that were mild (30.7%) or moderate (32.1%) in severity. Slightly more patients in the 4.6 mg/24 hours patch group reported mild events than in the 13.3 mg/24 hours patch group, while the numbers of patients reporting moderate events were comparable between groups. Severe adverse reactions were reported at a slightly higher percentage at the higher dose (12.4%) than at the lower dose (10%) treatment groups. With the exception of severe adverse reactions of agitation (13.3 mg: 1.1%; 4.6 mg: 1.4%), fall (13.3 mg: 1.1%) and urinary tract infection (4.6 mg: 1.1%), all adverse reactions reported as severe occurred in less than 1% of patients in either treatment group. Table 4: Proportion of Adverse Reactions in the 24-week Double-Blind (DB) Treatment Phase (at Least 5% in Any Treatment Group) in Study 3 *Weight Decreased as presented in Table 4 is based upon clinical observations and/or adverse events reported by patients or caregivers. Body weight was monitored as a vital sign at prespecified time points throughout the course of the clinical study. The proportion of patients who had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight was 11% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 4.6 mg/24 hours and 14.1% of those treated with rivastigmine transdermal system 13.3 mg/24 hours during the 24-week double-blind treatment.

This number was 4.9% and 8.4% in the Chinese population and Japanese population, respectively. Cases of skin irritation were captured separately on an investigator-rated skin irritation scale. Skin irritation, when observed, was mostly slight or mild in severity and was rated as severe in <=2.2% of rivastigmine transdermal system patients in a double-blind controlled study and in <=3.7% of rivastigmine transdermal system patients in a double-blind controlled study in Japanese patients. Parkinson's Disease Dementia 76-week International Open-Label Trial (Study 4) Rivastigmine transdermal system has been administered to 288 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia in a single, 76-week, open-label, active-comparator safety study. Of these, 256 have been treated for at least 12 weeks, 232 for at least 24 weeks, and 196 for at least 52 weeks. Treatment with rivastigmine transdermal system was initiated at 4.6 mg/24 hours and if tolerated the dose was increased after 4 weeks to 9.5 mg/24 hours. Rivastigmine tartrate capsule (target maintenance dose of 12 mg/day) served as the active comparator and was administered to 294 patients. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 5.

In patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease the following adverse drug reactions have only been observed in clinical trials with rivastigmine tartrate capsules: Frequent: nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, restlessness, worsening of Parkinson's disease, bradycardia, diarrhea, dyspepsia, salivary hypersecretion, sweating increased; Infrequent (those occurring between 1/100 to 1/1000 patients): dystonia, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of rivastigmine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypertension, application site hypersensitivity, urticaria, blister, allergic dermatitis, seizure, Parkinson's disease (worsening), tachycardia, abnormal liver function tests, disseminated allergic dermatitis, and tremor."$$

Most commonly observed adverse reactions (>5% and 2 times greater than placebo): nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to over 5,297 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 4,326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3,407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2,150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1,250 patients have been treated for 2 years, and 168 patients have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 mg to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Rivastigmine tartrate use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate was 15% for patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on rivastigmine tartrate compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Most Frequent Adverse Reactions Leading to Withdrawal from Clinical Trials during Titration and Maintenance in Patients Receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day Rivastigmine Tartrate Using a Forced-Dose Titration Study Phase Titration Maintenance Overall Rivastigmine tartrate >=6 to 1 2 mg/day (n=1,189) Placebo (n=868) Rivastigmine tartrate >=6 to 1 2 mg/day (n=987) Placebo (n=788) Rivastigmine tartrate >=6 to 1 2 mg/day (n=1,189) Placebo (n=868) Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 8 < 1 1 < 1 8 1 Vomiting 4 < 1 1 < 1 5 < 1 Anorexia 2 0 1 < 1 3 < 1 Dizziness 2 < 1 1 < 1 2 < 1 Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 2 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 6 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse events in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men.

A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate -treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients. The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase (43% versus 9% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (17% versus 4% for placebo). **Weight Decreased: In the controlled trials, approximately 26% of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate (greater than 9 mg per day) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight compared to 6% in the placebo-treated patients. About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. ***Anorexia: In the controlled clinical trials, of the patients treated with a rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day, 17% developed anorexia compared to 3% of the placebo patients. Neither the time course nor the severity of the anorexia is known. Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to 779 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 663 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 476 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, and 313 patients have been treated for 1 year. Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18.2% for patients receiving 3 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 11.2% for patients on placebo during the 24-week study. The most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate versus 0.0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with 1 basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment.

Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during 8 controlled clinical trials and 9 open-label trials in North America, Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified WHO dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 5,297 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving rivastigmine tartrate. All adverse events occurring in at least 6 patients (approximately 0.1%) are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, relatively minor events, or events unlikely to be drug-caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events-those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events-those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to rivastigmine tartrate treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

Rivastigmine tartrate has been administered to over 5,297 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Of these, 4,326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3,407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2,150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1,250 patients have been treated for 2 years, and 168 patients have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 mg to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions rivastigmine tartrate use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinuation Rates The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine tartrate was 15% for patients receiving 6 mg to 12 mg per day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on rivastigmine tartrate compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse events in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men.

A total of 31% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients developed at least 1 episode of vomiting (compared with 6% for placebo). The rate of vomiting was higher during the titration phase (24% versus 3% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (14% versus 3% for placebo). The rates were higher in women than men. Five percent of patients discontinued for vomiting, compared to less than 1% for patients on placebo. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine tartrate-treated patients and was rated as mild or moderate each in 14% of patients. The rate of nausea was higher during the titration phase (43% versus 9% for placebo) than in the maintenance phase (17% versus 4% for placebo). **Weight Decreased: In the controlled trials, approximately 26% of women on high doses of rivastigmine tartrate (greater than 9 mg per day) had weight loss equal to or greater than 7% of their baseline weight compared to 6% in the placebo-treated patients. About 18% of the males in the high-dose group experienced a similar degree of weight loss compared to 4% in placebo-treated patients. It is not clear how much of the weight loss was associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and the diarrhea associated with the drug. ***Anorexia: In the controlled clinical trials, of the patients treated with an rivastigmine tartrate dose of 6 mg to 12 mg per day, 17% developed anorexia compared to 3% of the placebo patients.

Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of at Least 2% Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in a single placebo-controlled trial and during the first 24 weeks of a 76-week open-label active-controlled trial for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 mg to 12 mg per day than for those treated with placebo in the placebo-controlled trial. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with 1 basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment.

Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during 8 controlled clinical trials and 9 open-label trials in North America, Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified WHO dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 5,297 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving rivastigmine tartrate. All adverse events occurring in at least 6 patients (approximately 0.1%) are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, relatively minor events, or events unlikely to be drug-caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events-those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events-those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to rivastigmine tartrate treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Dementia of the Alzheimer's T ype Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of Exelon(R) (rivastigmine tartrate) was 15% for patients receiving 6-12 mg/day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on Exelon compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10-12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 patients treated for over 3 years. Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during 8 controlled clinical trials and 9 open-label trials in North America, Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified WHO dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 5,297 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving Exelon. All adverse events occurring in at least 6 patients (approximately 0.1%) are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, relatively minor events, or events unlikely to be drug-caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients.

An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined on the incidence of adverse events in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men. Table 2.

Dementia Associated with Parkinson's disease Adverse Events leading to discontinuation The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the single controlled trial of rivastigmine tartrate was 18.2% for patients receiving 3 to12 mg/day compared to 11.2% for patients on placebo during the 24 week study. The most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving rivastigmine tartrate and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% rivastigmine tartrate vs. 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% rivastigmine tartrate vs. 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% rivastigmine tartrate vs. 0.0% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Rivastigmine Tartrate The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by rivastigmine tartrate's cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with rivastigmine tartrate doses of 3 to12 mg/day than for those treated with placebo.

Of these, 4326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1250 have been treated for 2 years, and 168 have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2809 patients were exposed to doses of 10-12 mg, 2615 patients treated for 3 months, 2328 patients treated for 6 months, 1378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 treated for over 3 years. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during 8 controlled clinical trials and 9 open-label trials in North America, Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified WHO dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 5297 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules. All adverse events occurring in at least 6 patients (approximately 0.1 %) are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, relatively minor events, or events unlikely to be drug-caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules doses of 3 to 12 mg/day than for those treated with placebo. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. Table 3.

Of these, 4,326 patients have been treated for at least 3 months, 3,407 patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 2,150 patients have been treated for 1 year, 1,250 have been treated for 2 years, and 168 have been treated for over 3 years. With regard to exposure to the highest dose, 2,809 patients were exposed to doses of 10 to 12 mg, 2,615 patients treated for 3 months, 2,328 patients treated for 6 months, 1,378 patients treated for 1 year, 917 patients treated for 2 years, and 129 treated for over 3 years. Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during 8 controlled clinical trials and 9 open-label trials in North America, Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Japan were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified WHO dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 5,297 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules. All adverse events occurring in at least 6 patients (approximately 0.1%) are included, except for those already listed elsewhere in labeling, WHO terms too general to be informative, relatively minor events, or events unlikely to be drug-caused. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Dementia of the Alzheimer's type The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in controlled clinical trials of Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules was 15% for patients receiving 6 to 12 mg/day compared to 5% for patients on placebo during forced weekly dose titration. While on a maintenance dose, the rates were 6% for patients on Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules compared to 4% for those on placebo. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules' cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dyspepsia, and asthenia. Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules' use is associated with significant nausea, vomiting, and weight loss (see ). Table 2 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules doses of 6 to 12 mg/day than for those treated with placebo. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice when patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescriber with one basis by which to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. In general, adverse reactions were less frequent later in the course of treatment. No systematic effect of race or age could be determined from the incidence of adverse events in the controlled studies. Nausea, vomiting and weight loss were more frequent in women than men. Other adverse events observed at a rate of 2% or more on Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules 6 to 12 mg/day but at a greater or equal rate on placebo were chest pain, peripheral edema, vertigo, back pain, arthralgia, pain, bone fracture, agitation, nervousness, delusion, paranoid reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, infection (general), coughing, pharyngitis, bronchitis, rash (general), urinary incontinence.

The most frequent adverse events that led to discontinuation from this study, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules and more frequent than those receiving placebo, were nausea (3.6% Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules vs. 0.6% placebo), vomiting (1.9% Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules vs 0.6% placebo), and tremor (1.7% Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules vs. 0% placebo). The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules' cholinergic effects. These include nausea, vomiting, tremor, anorexia, and dizziness.

"Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The elevation of prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Tartrate Capsules: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine. Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of rivastigmine is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine. Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), \\316\\262-blockers (n=42), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35), and antihistamines (n=15). Use with Anticholinergics: Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors: A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."$$
