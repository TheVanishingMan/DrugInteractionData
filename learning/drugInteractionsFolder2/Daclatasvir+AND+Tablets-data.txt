"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bradycardia When Coadministered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone: Serious symptomatic bradycardia may occur in patients taking amiodarone with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting agent, including DAKLINZA, particularly in patients also receiving beta blockers or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease. Coadministration of amiodarone with DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir is not recommended. In patients with no alternative treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (5.2, 6.2, 7.3) 5.1 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of DAKLINZA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]: -loss of therapeutic effect of DAKLINZA and possible development of resistance, -dosage adjustments of concomitant medications or DAKLINZA, -possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs or DAKLINZA. See Table 3 for drugs contraindicated with DAKLINZA due to loss of efficacy and possible development of resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. See Table 7 for steps to prevent or manage other possible and known significant drug interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Consider the potential for drug interactions before and during DAKLINZA therapy, review concomitant medications during DAKLINZA therapy, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.2 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral, including DAKLINZA. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this bradycardia effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no alternative treatment options and who will be coadministered DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir: -Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia. -Cardiac monitoring in an inpatient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who are taking sofosbuvir in combination with DAKLINZA who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir in combination with DAKLINZA should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above. Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or memory problems [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3), Table 7 ]. 5.3 Risks Associated with Ribavirin Combination Treatment If DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir are administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS If DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir are administered with ribavirin, refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin regarding ribavirin-associated adverse reactions. The following serious adverse reaction is described below and elsewhere in the labeling: -Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Most common adverse reactions (>=10%) observed with DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir were headache and fatigue. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions (>=10%) observed with DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir and ribavirin were headache, anemia, fatigue, and nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Approximately 2400 subjects with chronic HCV infection have been treated with the recommended dose of DAKLINZA in combination with other anti-HCV drugs in clinical trials. Six hundred seventy-nine subjects have received a DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir-based regimen. Safety experience from three clinical trials of DAKLINZA and sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin is presented. DAKLINZA and Sofosbuvir In the ALLY-3 trial, 152 treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects with HCV genotype 3 infection were treated with DAKLINZA 60 mg once daily in combination with sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (frequency of 10% or greater) were headache and fatigue. All adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. No subjects discontinued therapy for adverse events. In the ALLY-2 trial, 153 treatment-naive and treatment-experienced subjects with HCV/HIV-1 coinfection were treated with DAKLINZA 60 mg once daily (dose-adjusted for concomitant antiretroviral use) in combination with sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The most common adverse reaction (frequency of 10% or greater) was fatigue. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. No subjects discontinued therapy for adverse events. Adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment and occurring at a frequency of 5% or greater in ALLY-3 or ALLY-2 are presented in Table 4.

The most common adverse reactions (frequency of 10% or greater) among the 113 subjects were headache, anemia, fatigue, and nausea. The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Of the 15 (13%) subjects who discontinued study drug for adverse events, 13 (12%) subjects discontinued ribavirin only and 2 (2%) subjects discontinued all study drugs. During treatment, 4 subjects in the cirrhotic cohort underwent liver transplantation. Adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment and occurring at a frequency of 5% or greater in either treatment cohort in ALLY-1 are presented in Table 5.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiate treatment with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral, including DAKLINZA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ]."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Drug Interactions: Coadministration of DAKLINZA can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of daclatasvir. Consult the full prescribing information before use for contraindicated drugs and other potential drug-drug interactions. (2.3, 4, 5.1, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect DAKLINZA Daclatasvir is a substrate of CYP3A. Therefore, moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A may decrease the plasma levels and therapeutic effect of daclatasvir [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Contraindications (4), and Table 7 ]. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (eg, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma levels of daclatasvir [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Table 7 ]. 7.2 Potential for DAKLINZA to Affect Other Drugs Daclatasvir is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Administration of DAKLINZA may increase systemic exposure to medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp, OATP 1B1 or 1B3, or BCRP, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect or adverse reactions (see Table 7 ). 7.3 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Refer to the prescribing information for other agents in the regimen for drug interaction information. The most conservative recommendation should be followed. Please also refer to Section 4 (Contraindications) and Section 12.3 (Pharmacokinetics) for complete information on all drug interactions. Table 7 provides clinical recommendations for established or potentially significant drug interactions between DAKLINZA and other drugs [see Contraindications (4) ]. Clinically relevant increase in concentration is indicated as "|" and clinically relevant decrease as "|" for drug interaction data [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 7: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentrationa Clinical Comment a The direction of the arrow (| = increase, | = decrease) indicates the direction of the change in pharmacokinetic parameters. b These interactions have been studied [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Tables 9 and 10 ]. HIV antiviral agents Protease inhibitors: Atazanavir with ritonavirb Indinavir Nelfinavir Saquinavir | Daclatasvir Decrease DAKLINZA dose to 30 mg once daily. Other antiretrovirals: Cobicistat-containing antiretroviral regimens Examples: atazanavir/cobicistat, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate | Daclatasvir Decrease DAKLINZA dose to 30 mg once daily except with darunavir combined with cobicistat. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI): Efavirenzb Etravirine Nevirapine | Daclatasvir Increase DAKLINZA dose to 90 mg once daily. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (see also HIV antiviral agents) Examples: clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole,b nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, voriconazole | Daclatasvir Decrease DAKLINZA dose to 30 mg once daily when coadministered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A. Moderate CYP3A inducers (see also HIV antiviral agents) Examples: bosentan, dexamethasone, modafinil, nafcillin, rifapentine | Daclatasvir Increase DAKLINZA dose to 90 mg once daily when coadministered with moderate inducers of CYP3A. Anticoagulants Dabigatran etexilate mesylate | Dabigatran Use of DAKLINZA with dabigatran etexilate is not recommended in specific renal impairment groups, depending on the indication. Please see the dabigatran prescribing information for specific recommendations. Cardiovascular agents Antiarrhythmic: Amiodarone Amiodarone: effects unknown Coadministration of amiodarone with DAKLINZA in combination with sofosbuvir is not recommended because it may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. If coadministration is required, cardiac monitoring is recommended. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2).] Antiarrhythmic: Digoxinb | Digoxin Patients already receiving daclatasvir initiating digoxin: Initiate treatment using the lowest appropriate digoxin dosage. Monitor digoxin concentrations; adjust digoxin doses if necessary and continue monitoring. Patients already receiving digoxin prior to initiating daclatasvir: Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating daclatasvir. Reduce digoxin concentrations by decreasing digoxin dosage by approximately 15% to 30% or by modifying the dosing frequency and continue monitoring. Lipid-lowering agents HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: Atorvastatin Fluvastatin Pitavastatin Pravastatin Rosuvastatinb Simvastatin | Atorvastatin | Fluvastatin | Pitavastatin | Pravastatin | Rosuvastatin | Simvastatin Monitor for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-associated adverse events such as myopathy. Narcotic Analgesic/Treatment of Opioid Dependence buprenorphine buprenorphine/naloxone | buprenorphine | norbuprenorphine For buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone, no adjustment is needed, but clinical monitoring for buprenorphine-associated adverse events is recommended. 7.4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with DAKLINZA Please see Section 12.3 (Pharmacokinetics) for information regarding anticipated interactions that are not clinically relevant. Based on the results of drug interaction trials [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], no clinically relevant changes in exposure were observed for cyclosporine, darunavir (with ritonavir), dolutegravir, escitalopram, ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, lopinavir (with ritonavir), methadone, midazolam, tacrolimus, or tenofovir with concomitant use of daclatasvir. No clinically relevant changes in daclatasvir exposure were observed with cyclosporine, darunavir (with ritonavir), dolutegravir, escitalopram, famotidine, lopinavir (with ritonavir), omeprazole, sofosbuvir, tacrolimus, or tenofovir. No dosage adjustment for daclatasvir is necessary with darunavir/cobicistat or moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including atazanavir (unboosted), fosamprenavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, or verapamil."$$
