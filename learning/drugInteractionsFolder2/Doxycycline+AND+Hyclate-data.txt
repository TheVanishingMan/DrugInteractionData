"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (2.2, 5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported. Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. (5.2) Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Limit sun exposure. (5.3) Overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi, may occur. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. (5.4) 5.1 Tooth Development The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies. 5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. 5.4 Potentaial for Microbial Overgrowth ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. 5.6 Delayed Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg per kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, but data for doxycycline are limited. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.7 Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Incomplete Suppression of Malaria Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum's sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.10 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed."$$

Doxycycline should not be used in this age group, except for anthrax, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure), unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. 5.2 Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. 5.4 Superinfection As with other antibacterial preparations, use of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibacterial should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracycline including doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. 5.6 Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.7 Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8 Malaria Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum's sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.10 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs.

Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg was given orally once-a-day for 7 days and compared to doxycycline hyclate capsules 100 mg given orally twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of men and women with uncomplicated urogenital C. trachomatis infection. Adverse events in the Safety Population were reported by 99 (40.2%) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg treatment group and 132 (53.2%) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate capsules reference treatment group. Most AEs were mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bacterial vaginitis, Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Greater than or Equal to 2% of Subjects Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg N = 246 Preferred Term n (%) Subjects with any AE 99 (40.2) Nausea 33 (13.4) Vomiting 20 (8.1) Headache 5 (2.0) Diarrhea 8 (3.3) Abdominal Pain Upper 5 (2.0) Vaginitis Bacterial 8 (3.3) Vulvovaginal Mycotic Infection 5 (2.0) Because clinical trials are conducted under prescribed conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial may not always reflect the rates observed in practice. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of doxycycline. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Renal: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Intracranial Hypertension: Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracycline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Thyroid Gland Changes: When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions observed in patients receiving tetracyclines include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, photosensitivity, urticaria, and hemolytic anemia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Warner Chilcott at 1-800-521-8813 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety and efficacy of DORYX Tablets, 200 mg as a single daily dose was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study. DORYX Tablets, 200 mg was given orally once-a-day for 7 days and compared to doxycycline hyclate capsules 100 mg given orally twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of men and women with uncomplicated urogenital C . trachomatis infection. Adverse events in the Safety Population were reported by 99 (40.2%) subjects in the DORYX Tablets, 200 mg treatment group and 132 (53.2%) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate capsules reference treatment group. Most AEs were mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bacterial vaginitis, Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in Greater than or Equal to 2% of Subjects DORYX Tablets, 200 mg N = 246 Preferred Term n (%) Subjects with any AE 99 (40.2) Nausea 33 (13.4) Vomiting 20 (8.1) Headache 5 (2.0) Diarrhea 8 (3.3) Abdominal Pain Upper 5 (2.0) Vaginitis Bacterial 8 (3.3) Vulvovaginal Mycotic Infection 5 (2.0) Because clinical trials are conducted under prescribed conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial may not always reflect the rates observed in practice. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Renal : Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Blood : Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Benign Intracranial Hypertension Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults [ s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Thyroid Gland Changes: When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials or post-approval use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal:Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Photosensitivity has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Renal: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )].

"ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials involving a total of 1436 patients, adverse experiences from all causalities were monitored across treatment groups. In the Circulatory System category, 10 subjects (1.6%) in the ATRIDOX(R) group were reported as having \\\\"unspecified essential hypertension.\\\\" Only 1 subject (0.2%) in the Vehicle group, and none in the Scaling and Root Planing or Oral Hygiene groups were reported to have \\\\"unspecified essential hypertension.\\\\" In all cases, the event occurred anywhere from 13 to 134 days post treatment. There is no known association of oral administration of doxycycline with essential hypertension.

"DESCRIPTION Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, and is available as doxycycline hyclate (doxycycline hydrochloride hemiethanolate hemihydrate) for oral administration. Doxycycline hyclate is a yellow crystalline powder which is soluble in water. Doxycycline has a high degree of lipoid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. Doxycycline will not degrade into an epianhydro form. Each capsule, for oral administration, contains Doxycycline Hyclate, equivalent to 50 mg or 100 mg of Doxycycline. Each tablet, for oral administration, contains Doxycycline Hyclate, equivalent to 100 mg of Doxycycline. Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules USP 50 mg and 100 mg contain the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. The capsule shells contain: FD&C Blue No. 1, gelatin, silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide. Doxycycline Hyclate Tablets USP 100 mg contain the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 6, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide."$$
"Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacterial antibiotics, such as the tetracycline class of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of members of the \\316\\262-lactam (e.g. penicillin) class of antibiotics, it is not advisable to administer these antibiotics concomitantly. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron containing preparations, and by bismuth subsalicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines may render oral contraceptives less effective."$$
