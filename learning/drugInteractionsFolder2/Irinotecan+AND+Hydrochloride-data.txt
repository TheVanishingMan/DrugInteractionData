"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of CAMPTOSAR) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR) can occur. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Treat with loperamide. Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever. Interrupt CAMPTOSAR and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Manage promptly with antibiotic support. Interrupt CAMPTOSAR and reduce subsequent doses if necessary. (5.2) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of CAMPTOSAR treatment. (5.3) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue CAMPTOSAR if this occurs. (5.4) Renal Impairment/Renal Failure: Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. (5.5) Pulmonary Toxicity: Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred. Interrupt for new or progressive dysnpnea, cough, and fever pending evaluation. If IPD diagnosed, discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed. (5.6) Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen: CAMPTOSAR should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study. (5.7) Embryofetal Toxicity: CAMPTOSAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (5.9) Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In clinical trials, CAMPTOSAR has not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases, or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases. With the weekly dosage schedule, patients with total bilirubin levels 1.0-2.0 mg/dL had greater likelihood of grade 3-4 neutropenia. (5.10) 5.1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of CAMPTOSAR) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3-4 late diarrhea occurred in 23-31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3-week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with CAMPTOSAR until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of CAMPTOSAR should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea. 5.2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with CAMPTOSAR. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hold CAMPTOSAR if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm3. After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count >=1000/mm3, subsequent doses of CAMPTOSAR should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of CAMPTOSAR. Based on sparse available data, the concurrent administration of CAMPTOSAR with irradiation is not recommended. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1.0 mg/dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert's syndrome, may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with CAMPTOSAR. 5.3 Patients With Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of CAMPTOSAR treatment. In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent CAMPTOSAR (350 mg/m2 once-every-3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). In a prospective study (n=250) to investigate the role of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism in the development of toxicity in patients treated with CAMPTOSAR (180 mg/m2) in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 4.5%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 5.3%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 1.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. In another study in which 109 patients were treated with CAMPTOSAR (100-125 mg/m2) in combination with bolus 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 18.2%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 11.1%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 6.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. When administered in combination with other agents or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of CAMPTOSAR should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients. Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6/6, 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue CAMPTOSAR if anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.5 Renal Impairment/Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during CAMPTOSAR therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, CAMPTOSAR and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well-designed clinical study, CAMPTOSAR Injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. CAMPTOSAR should be used as recommended in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 5.8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In patients receiving either irinotecan/5-FU/LV or 5-FU/LV in the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1. 5.9 Embryofetal Toxicity CAMPTOSAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Irinotecan was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than those administered to humans on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, at exposures approximately 0.2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose, irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures (approximately 0.025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with CAMPTOSAR. 5.10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of CAMPTOSAR in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established. In clinical trials of either dosing schedule, irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL, or transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis, or transaminase >5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis. In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/226]; p<0.001) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$

In clinical trials of either dosing schedule, irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL, or transaminase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis, or transaminase greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis. In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/226]; p less than 0.001) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea and cholinergic reactions: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) can occur. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Treat with loperamide. Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Manage promptly with antibiotic support. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if necessary. (5.2) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection treatment. (5.3) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride injection if this occurs. (5.4) Renal Impairment/Renal Failure: Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. (5.5) Pulmonary Toxicity: Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred. Interrupt for new or progressive dysnpnea, cough, and fever pending evaluation. If IPD diagnosed, discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed. (5.6) Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study. (5.7) Embryofetal Toxicity: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (5.9) Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In clinical trials, irinotecan hydrochloride injection has not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases, or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases. With the weekly dosage schedule, patients with total bilirubin levels 1.0-2.0 mg/dL had greater likelihood of grade 3-4 neutropenia. (5.10) 5.1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3-4 late diarrhea occurred in 23-31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3-week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with irinotecan until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea. 5.2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Hold irinotecan hydrochloride injection if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm3. After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count >=1000/mm3, subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Based on sparse available data, the concurrent administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection with irradiation is not recommended. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1.0 mg/dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert's syndrome, may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. 5.3 Patients With Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection treatment. In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride injection (350 mg/m2 once-every-3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). When administered in combination with other agents or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients. Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6/6, 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride injection if anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.5 Renal Impairment/Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination with 5-FU/LV and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, irinotecan hydrochloride injection and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well-designed clinical study, irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be used as recommended in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1. 5.9 Embryofetal Toxicity Irinotecan hydrochloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Irinotecan was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than those administered to humans on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, at exposures approximately 0.2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose, irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures (approximately 0.025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. 5.10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established.

In rats, at exposures approximately 0.2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose, irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures (approximately 0.025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. 5.10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established. In clinical trials of either dosing schedule, irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL, or transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis, or transaminase >5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis. In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/226]; p<0.001) [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea and cholinergic reactions: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection) can occur. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Treat with loperamide. Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever. Interrupt Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Manage promptly with antibiotic support. Interrupt Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection and reduce subsequent doses if necessary. (5.2) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection treatment. (5.3) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection if this occurs. (5.4) Renal Impairment/Renal Failure: Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. (5.5) Pulmonary Toxicity: Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred. Interrupt for new or progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever pending evaluation. If IPD diagnosed, discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed. (5.6) Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen: Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4 to 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study. (5.7) Pregnancy: Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (5.9) Hepatic Impairment: In clinical trials, Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection has not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases, or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases. With the weekly dosage schedule, patients with total bilirubin levels 1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL had greater likelihood of grade 3-4 neutropenia. (5.10) 5.1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3-4 late diarrhea occurred in 23 to 31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3-week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with irinotecan until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea. 5.2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hold Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm3. After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count >=1000/mm3, subsequent doses of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection. Based on sparse available data, the concurrent administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection with irradiation is not recommended. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1.0 mg/dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert's syndrome, may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection. 5.3 Patients With Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection treatment. In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection (350 mg/m2 once-every-3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). In a prospective study (n=250) to investigate the role of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism in the development of toxicity in patients treated with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection (180 mg/m2) in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 4.5%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 5.3%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 1.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. In another study in which 109 patients were treated with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection (100 to 125 mg/m2) in combination with bolus 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 18.2%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 11.1%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 6.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. When administered in combination with other agents or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients. Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6/6, 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection if anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.5 Renal Impairment/Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, irinotecan and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well-designed clinical study, Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4 to 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection should be used as recommended in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 5.8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1. 5.9 Pregnancy Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

In a prospective study (n=250) to investigate the role of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism in the development of toxicity in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride (180 mg/m2) in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 4.5%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 5.3%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 1.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. In another study in which 109 patients were treated with irinotecan hydrochloride (100 to 125 mg/m2) in combination with bolus 5-FU/LV, the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 18.2%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele the incidence was 11.1%. Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 6.8% of patients homozygous for the wild-type allele. When administered in combination with other agents or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of irinotecan hydrochloride should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients. Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6/6, 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride if anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.5 Renal Impairment/Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan hydrochloride therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, irinotecan hydrochloride and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. 5.7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well-designed clinical study, irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4 to 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. 5.8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1. 5.9 Embryofetal Toxicity Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Irinotecan was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than those administered to humans on a mg/m2 basis. In rats, at exposures approximately 0.2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose, irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures (approximately 0.025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg/m2 dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride. 5.10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established. In clinical trials of either dosing schedule, irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL, or transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis, or transaminase >5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis. In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1 to 2 mg/dL) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/226]; p<0.001) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea and cholinergic reactions: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride) can occur. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Treat with loperamide. Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Manage promptly with antibiotic support. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride and reduce subsequent doses if necessary. (5.2) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride treatment. (5.3) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride if this occurs. (5.4) Renal Impairment/Renal Failure: Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. (5.5) Pulmonary Toxicity: Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred. Interrupt for new or progressive dysnpnea, cough, and fever pending evaluation. If IPD diagnosed, discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed. (5.6) Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen: Irinotecan hydrochloride should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4 to 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study. (5.7) Embryofetal Toxicity: Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (5.9) Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In clinical trials, irinotecan hydrochloridehas not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases, or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases. With the weekly dosage schedule, patients with total bilirubin levels 1 to 2 mg/dL had greater likelihood of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. (5.10) 5.1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3 to 4 late diarrhea occurred in 23 to 31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3 week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with irinotecan until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea. 5.2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Hold irinotecan hydrochloride if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops < 1000/mm3. After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count >= 1000/mm3, subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride. Based on sparse available data, the concurrent administration of irinotecan hydrochloride with irradiation is not recommended. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1 mg/dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert's syndrome, may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride. 5.3 Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride treatment. In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride (350 mg/m2 once-every 3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). When administered in combination with other agents, or as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of irinotecan hydrochloride should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal ILD has occurred in patients receiving irinotecan HCl. Discontinue ONIVYDE if ILD is diagnosed. ( 5.3) Severe hypersensitivity reaction: Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE for severe hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.4, 4) Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.5, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia ONIVYDE can cause severe or life-threatening neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis. In Study 1, the incidence of fatal neutropenic sepsis was 0.8% among patients receiving ONIVYDE, occurring in one of 117 patients in the ONIVYDE plus fluorouracil/leucovorin (ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV) arm and one of 147 patients receiving ONIVYDE as a single agent. Severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV compared to 2% of patients receiving fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (5-FU/LV). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis occurred in 3% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, and did not occur in patients receiving 5-FU/LV. In patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher among Asian patients [18 of 33 (55%)] compared to White patients [13 of 73 (18%)]. Neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian patients compared to 1% of White patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle and more frequently if clinically indicated. Withhold ONIVYDE if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1500/mm 3 or if neutropenic fever occurs. Resume ONIVYDE when the ANC is 1500/mm 3 or above. Reduce ONIVYDE dose for Grade 3-4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever following recovery in subsequent cycles [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Severe Diarrhea ONIVYDE can cause severe and life-threatening diarrhea. Do not administer ONIVYDE to patients with bowel obstruction. Severe or life-threatening diarrhea followed one of two patterns: late onset diarrhea (onset more than 24 hours following chemotherapy) and early onset diarrhea (onset within 24 hours of chemotherapy, sometimes occurring with other symptoms of cholinergic reaction) [see Cholinergic Reactions (6.1) ]. An individual patient may experience both early and late-onset diarrhea. In Study 1, Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 13% receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV compared to 4% receiving 5-FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late onset diarrhea was 9% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, compared to 4% in patients receiving 5-FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea was 3% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV, compared to no Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea in patients receiving 5-FU/LV. Of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV in Study 1, 34% received loperamide for late-onset diarrhea and 26% received atropine for early-onset diarrhea. Withhold ONIVYDE for Grade 2-4 diarrhea. Initiate loperamide for late onset diarrhea of any severity. Administer intravenous or subcutaneous atropine 0.25 to 1 mg (unless clinically contraindicated) for early onset diarrhea of any severity. Following recovery to Grade 1 diarrhea, resume ONIVYDE at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5. 3 Interstitial Lung Disease Irinotecan HCl can cause severe and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD). Withhold ONIVYDE in patients with new or progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever, pending diagnostic evaluation. Discontinue ONIVYDE in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD. 5. 4 Severe Hypersensitivity Reaction Irinotecan HCl can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction. 5. 5 Embryo -F etal Toxicity Based on animal data with irinotecan HCl and the mechanism of action of ONIVYDE, ONIVYDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed following treatment with irinotecan HCl, at doses resulting in irinotecan exposures lower than those achieved with ONIVYDE 70 mg/m 2 in humans, administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONIVYDE and for one month following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]."$$

Serious opportunistic infections have not been observed, and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia. Second-Line Single-Agent Therapy Weekly Dosage Schedule In three clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5-FU-based therapy were treated with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP. Seventeen of the patients died within 30 days of the administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP; in five cases (1.6%, 5/304), the deaths were potentially drug-related. One of the patients died of neutropenic sepsis without fever. Neutropenic fever occurred in nine (3.0%) other patients; these patients recovered with supportive care. One hundred nineteen (39.1%) of the 304 patients were hospitalized because of adverse events; 81 (26.6%) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP. The primary reasons for drug-related hospitalization were diarrhea, with or without nausea and/or vomiting (18.4%); neutropenia/leukopenia, with or without diarrhea and/or fever (8.2%); and nausea and/or vomiting (4.9%). The first dose of at least one cycle of Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP was reduced for 67% of patients who began the studies at the 125-mg/m2 starting dose. Within-cycle dose reductions were required for 32% of the cycles initiated at the 125-mg/m2 dose level. The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Thirteen (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP because of adverse events. The adverse events in Table 3 are based on the experience of the 304 patients enrolled in the three studies described in CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1) . Table 3.

Eleven (3.5%) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment. In three cases (1%, 3/316), the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea, and asthenia, respectively. One (0.8%, 1/129) patient treated with 5-FU died within 30 days of treatment; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events occurred at least once in 60% (188/316) of patients who received irinotecan, 63% (57/90) who received best supportive care, and 39% (50/129) who received 5-FU-based therapy. Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7% treated with 5-FU-based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan, the most clinically significant adverse events (all grades, 1-4) were diarrhea (84%), alopecia (72%), nausea (70%), vomiting (62%), cholinergic symptoms (47%), and neutropenia (30%).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan therapy. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP. Symptomatic pancreatitis, asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported. Increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been observed. Hyponatremia, mostly with diarrhea and vomiting, has been reported. Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan Hydrochloride Injection, USP; in some cases, the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan. Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarizing drugs may be antagonized."$$

Serious opportunistic infections have not been observed, and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia. Second-Line Single-Agent Therapy Weekly Dosage Schedule In three clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5-FU-based therapy were treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Seventeen of the patients died within 30 days of the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection; in five cases (1.6%, 5/304), the deaths were potentially drug-related. One of the patients died of neutropenic sepsis without fever. Neutropenic fever occurred in nine (3%) other patients; these patients recovered with supportive care. One hundred nineteen (39.1%) of the 304 patients were hospitalized because of adverse events; 81 (26.6%) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. The primary reasons for drug-related hospitalization were diarrhea, with or without nausea and/or vomiting (18.4%); neutropenia/leukopenia, with or without diarrhea and/or fever (8.2%); and nausea and/or vomiting (4.9%). The first dose of at least one cycle of irinotecan hydrochloride injection was reduced for 67% of patients who began the studies at the 125-mg/m2 starting dose. Within-cycle dose reductions were required for 32% of the cycles initiated at the 125-mg/m2 dose level. The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Thirteen (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection because of adverse events. The adverse events in Table 7 are based on the experience of the 304 patients enrolled in the three studies described in Clinical Studies ( 14.1). Table 7.

Eleven (3.5%) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment. In three cases (1%, 3/316), the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea, and asthenia, respectively. One (0.8%, 1/129) patient treated with 5-FU died within 30 days of treatment; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events occurred at least once in 60% (188/316) of patients who received irinotecan, 63% (57/90) who received best supportive care, and 39% (50/129) who received 5-FU-based therapy. Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7% treated with 5-FU-based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan, the most clinically significant adverse events (all grades, 1 to 4) were diarrhea (84%), alopecia (72%), nausea (70%), vomiting (62%), cholinergic symptoms (47%), and neutropenia (30%). Table 8 lists the grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in the patients enrolled to all treatment arms of the two studies described in Clinical Studies (14.1).

The 8.5% incidence of akathisia, however, is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan therapy. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Symptomatic pancreatitis, asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported. Increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been observed. Hyponatremia, mostly with diarrhea and vomiting, has been reported. Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection; in some cases, the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan. Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarizing drugs may be antagonized."$$

Eleven (3.5%) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment. In three cases (1%, 3/316), the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea, and asthenia, respectively. One (0.8%, 1/129) patient treated with 5-FU died within 30 days of treatment; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events occurred at least once in 60% (188/316) of patients who received irinotecan, 63% (57/90) who received best supportive care, and 39% (50/129) who received 5-FU-based therapy. Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7% treated with 5-FU-based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan, the most clinically significant adverse events (all grades, 1 to 4) were diarrhea (84%), alopecia (72%), nausea (70%), vomiting (62%), cholinergic symptoms (47%), and neutropenia (30%). Table 8 lists the grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in the patients enrolled to all treatment arms of the two studies described in Clinical Studies (14.1).

The 8.5% incidence of akathisia, however, is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan therapy. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Symptomatic pancreatitis, asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported. Increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been observed. Hyponatremia, mostly with diarrhea and vomiting, has been reported. Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection; in some cases, the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan. Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarizing drugs may be antagonized."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Boxed Warning ] Severe Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Boxed Warning ] Interstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (>= 20%) of ONIVYDE: diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, stomatitis, and pyrexia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>= 10% Grade 3 or 4) were lymphopenia and neutropenia.

The safety data described below are derived from patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy who received any part of protocol-specified therapy in Study 1, an international, randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial. Protocol-specified therapy consisted of ONIVYDE 70 mg/m 2 with leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2 over 46 hours every 2 weeks (ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV; N=117), ONIVYDE 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks (N=147), or leucovorin 200 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil 2000 mg/m 2 over 24 hours weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 week rest (5-FU/LV; N=134) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Serum bilirubin within the institutional normal range, albumin >= 3 g/dL, and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) >= 70 were required for study entry. The median duration of exposure was 9 weeks in the ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV arm, 9 weeks in the ONIVYDE monotherapy arm, and 6 weeks in the 5-FU/LV arm. The most common adverse reactions (>= 20%) of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, stomatitis, and pyrexia. The most common, severe laboratory abnormalities (>= 10% Grade 3 or 4) were lymphopenia and neutropenia. The most common serious adverse reactions (>= 2%) of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, vomiting, neutropenic fever or neutropenic sepsis, nausea, pyrexia, sepsis, dehydration, septic shock, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of ONIVYDE in 11% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, vomiting, and sepsis. Dose reductions of ONIVYDE for adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions requiring dose reductions were neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, and anemia. ONIVYDE was withheld or delayed for adverse reactions in 62% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions requiring interruption or delays were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. Table 2 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions in Study 1 that occurred with higher incidence (>=5% difference for Grades 1-4 or >=2% difference for Grades 3-4) in patients who received ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV compared to patients who received 5-FU/LV.

In Study 1, Grade 1 or 2 cholinergic symptoms other than early diarrhea occurred in 12 (4.5%) ONIVYDE-treated patients. Six of these 12 patients received atropine and in 1 of the 6 patients, atropine was administered for cholinergic symptoms other than diarrhea. Infusion Reaction s: Infusion reactions, consisting of rash, urticaria, periorbital edema, or pruritus, occurring on the day of ONIVYDE administration were reported in 3% of patients receiving ONIVYDE or ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV. Laboratory abnormalities that occurred with higher incidence in the ONIVYDE/5-FU/LV arm compared to the 5-FU/LV arm (>=5% difference) are summarized in the following table.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Second-Line Single-Agent Therapy Weekly Dosage Schedule In three clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5 FU-based therapy were treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Seventeen of the patients died within 30 days of the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection; in five cases (1.6%, 5/304), the deaths were potentially drug-related. These five patients experienced a constellation of medical events that included known effects of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. One of these patients died of neutropenic sepsis without fever. Neutropenic fever occurred in nine (3.0%) other patients; these patients recovered with supportive care. One hundred nineteen (39.1%) of the 304 patients were hospitalized a total of 156 times because of adverse events; 81 (26.6%) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. The primary reasons for drug-related hospitalization were diarrhea, with or without nausea and/or vomiting (18.4%); neutropenia/leukopenia, with or without diarrhea and/or fever (8.2%); and nausea and/or vomiting (4.9%). Adjustments in the dose of irinotecan hydrochloride injection were made during the cycle of treatment and for subsequent cycles based on individual patient tolerance. The first dose of at least one cycle of irinotecan hydrochloride injection was reduced for 67% of patients who began the studies at the 125-mg/m2 starting dose. Within-cycle dose reductions were required for 32% of the cycles initiated at the 125-mg/m2 dose level. The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Thirteen (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection because of adverse events. The adverse events in Table 5 are based on the experience of the 304 patients enrolled in the three studies described in the CLINICAL STUDIES, Studies Evaluating the Weekly Dosage Schedule, section.

Eleven (3.5%) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment. In three cases (1%, 3/316), the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea, and asthenia, respectively. One (0.8%, 1/129) patient treated with 5-FU died within 30 days of treatment; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events (whether or not related to study treatment) occurred at least once in 60% (188/316) of patients who received irinotecan, 63% (57/90) who received best supportive care, and 39% (50/129) who received 5-FU- based therapy. Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7% treated with 5 FU-based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan, the most clinically significant adverse events (all grades, 1-4) were diarrhea (84%), alopecia (72%), nausea (70%), vomiting (62%), cholinergic symptoms (47%), and neutropenia (30%).

When observed, nausea and vomiting usually occur during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. In the clinical studies testing the every 3-week-dosage schedule, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days after irinotecan infusion. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, the median time to onset of late diarrhea was 11 days following administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. For patients starting treatment at the 125-mg/m2 weekly dose, the median duration of any grade of late diarrhea was 3 days. Among those patients treated at the 125-mg/m2 weekly dose who experienced grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea, the median duration of the entire episode of diarrhea was 7 days. The frequency of grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea was somewhat greater in patients starting treatment at 125 mg/m2 than in patients given a 100-mg/m2 weekly starting dose (34% [65/193] versus 23% [24/102]; p=0.08). The frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea by age was significantly greater in patients >=65 years than in patients <65 years (40% [53/133] versus 23% [40/171]; p=0.002). In one study of the weekly dosage treatment, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea was significantly greater in male than in female patients (43% [25/58] versus 16% [5/32]; p=0.01), but there were no gender differences in the frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea in the other two studies of the weekly dosage treatment schedule. Colonic ulceration, sometimes with gastrointestinal bleeding, has been observed in association with administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Hematology: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection commonly causes neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), and anemia. Serious thrombocytopenia is uncommon. When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). In these same studies, patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1.0 mg/dL or more also had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). There were no significant differences in the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia by age or gender. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. NCI grade 3 or 4 anemia was noted in 7% of the patients receiving weekly treatment; blood transfusions were given to 10% of the patients in these trials. Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fever, and abdominal pain are generally the most common events of this type. Cholinergic Symptoms: Patients may have cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping and early diarrhea. If these symptoms occur, they manifest during or shortly after drug infusion. They are thought to be related to the anticholinesterase activity of the irinotecan parent compound and are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Hepatic: In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, NCI grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities were observed in fewer than 10% of patients. These events typically occur in patients with known hepatic metastases. Dermatologic: Alopecia has been reported during treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Rashes have also been reported but did not result in discontinuation of treatment. Respiratory: Severe pulmonary events are infrequent. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, NCI grade 3 or 4 dyspnea was reported in 4% of patients. Over half the patients with dyspnea had lung metastases; the extent to which malignant pulmonary involvement or other preexisting lung disease may have contributed to dyspnea in these patients is unknown. Interstitial pulmonary disease presenting as pulmonary infiltrates is uncommon during irinotecan therapy. Interstitial pulmonary disease can be fatal. Risk factors possibly associated with the development of interstitial pulmonary disease include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan therapy. Neurologic: Insomnia and dizziness can occur, but are not usually considered to be directly related to the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Dizziness may sometimes represent symptomatic evidence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with dehydration. Cardiovascular: Vasodilation (flushing) may occur during administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Bradycardia may also occur, but has not required intervention. These effects have been attributed to the cholinergic syndrome sometimes observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection; the specific cause of these events has not been determined. Other Non-U.S. Clinical Trials Irinotecan has been studied in over 1100 patients in Japan. Patients in these studies had a variety of tumor types, including cancer of the colon or rectum, and were treated with several different doses and schedules. In general, the types of toxicities observed were similar to those seen in U.S. trials with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. There is some information from Japanese trials that patients with considerable ascites or pleural effusions were at increased risk for neutropenia or diarrhea. A potentially life-threatening pulmonary syndrome, consisting of dyspnea, fever, and a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray, was observed in a small percentage of patients in early Japanese studies. The contribution of irinotecan to these preliminary events was difficult to assess because these patients also had lung tumors and some had preexisting nonmalignant pulmonary disease. As a result of these observations, however, clinical studies in the United States have enrolled few patients with compromised pulmonary function, significant ascites, or pleural effusions. Post-Marketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection in clinical practice. Infrequent cases of ulcerative and ischemic colitis have been observed. This can be complicated by ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection, including typhlitis. Patients experiencing ileus should receive prompt antibiotic support (see PRECAUTIONS). Rare cases of intestinal perforation have been reported. Rare cases of symptomatic pancreatitis or asymptomatic elevated pancreatic enzymes have been observed. Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have also been observed (see WARNINGS). Rare cases of hyponatremia mostly related with diarrhea and vomiting have been reported. Transient and mild to moderate increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis; transient increase of amylase and occasionally transient increase of lipase have been very rarely reported. Infrequent cases of renal insufficiency including acute renal failure, hypotension or circulatory failure have been observed in patients who experienced episodes of dehydration associated with diarrhea and/or vomiting, or sepsis (see WARNINGS). Early effects such as muscular contraction or cramps and paresthesia have been reported."$$

When observed, nausea and vomiting usually occur during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. An increased incidence of late diarrhea was observed in two studies, one using a 3-week schedule and the other using a weekly schedule. In the clinical studies testing the every 3-week-dosage schedule, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days after irinotecan infusion. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, the median time to onset of late diarrhea was 11 days following administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. For patients starting treatment at the 125 mg/m2 weekly dose, the median duration of any grade of late diarrhea was 3 days. Among those patients treated at the 125 mg/m2 weekly dose who experienced grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea, the median duration of the entire episode of diarrhea was 7 days. The frequency of grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea was somewhat greater in patients starting treatment at 125 mg/m2 than in patients given a 100 mg/m2 weekly starting dose (34% [65/193] versus 23% [24/102]; p=0.08). The frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea by age was significantly greater in patients >=65 years than in patients <65 years (40% [53/133] versus 23% [40/171]; p=0.002). In another study of 183 patients treated on the weekly schedule, the frequency of grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea in patients >=65 years of age was 28.6% [26/91] and in patients <65 years of age was 23.9% [22/92]. In one study of the weekly dosage treatment, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea was significantly greater in male than in female patients (43% [25/58] versus 16% [5/32]; p=0.01), but there were no gender differences in the frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea in the other two studies of the weekly dosage treatment schedule. Colonic ulceration, sometimes with gastrointestinal bleeding, has been observed in association with administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Hematology: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection commonly causes neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), and anemia. Serious thrombocytopenia is uncommon. When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). In these same studies, patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1 mg/dL or more also had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). There were no significant differences in the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia by age or gender. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. NCI grade 3 or 4 anemia was noted in 7% of the patients receiving weekly treatment; blood transfusions were given to 10% of the patients in these trials. Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fever, and abdominal pain are generally the most common events of this type. Cholinergic Symptoms: Patients may have cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping and early diarrhea. If these symptoms occur, they manifest during or shortly after drug infusion. They are thought to be related to the anticholinesterase activity of the irinotecan parent compound and are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Hepatic: In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, NCI grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities were observed in fewer than 10% of patients. These events typically occur in patients with known hepatic metastases. Dermatologic: Alopecia has been reported during treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Rashes have also been reported but did not result in discontinuation of treatment. Respiratory: Severe pulmonary events are infrequent. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, NCI grade 3 or 4 dyspnea was reported in 4% of patients. Over half the patients with dyspnea had lung metastases; the extent to which malignant pulmonary involvement or other preexisting lung disease may have contributed to dyspnea in these patients is unknown. Interstitial pulmonary disease presenting as pulmonary infiltrates is uncommon during irinotecan therapy. Interstitial pulmonary disease can be fatal. Risk factors possibly associated with the development of interstitial pulmonary disease include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan therapy (see WARNINGS section). Neurologic: Insomnia and dizziness can occur, but are not usually considered to be directly related to the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Dizziness may sometimes represent symptomatic evidence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with dehydration. Cardiovascular: Vasodilation (flushing) may occur during administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Bradycardia may also occur, but has not required intervention. These effects have been attributed to the cholinergic syndrome sometimes observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection; the specific cause of these events has not been determined. Other Non-U.S. Clinical Trials Irinotecan has been studied in over 1100 patients in Japan. Patients in these studies had a variety of tumor types, including cancer of the colon or rectum, and were treated with several different doses and schedules. In general, the types of toxicities observed were similar to those seen in U.S. trials with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. There is some information from Japanese trials that patients with considerable ascites or pleural effusions were at increased risk for neutropenia or diarrhea. A potentially life-threatening pulmonary syndrome, consisting of dyspnea, fever, and a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray, was observed in a small percentage of patients in early Japanese studies. The contribution of irinotecan to these preliminary events was difficult to assess because these patients also had lung tumors and some had preexisting nonmalignant pulmonary disease. As a result of these observations, however, clinical studies in the United States have enrolled few patients with compromised pulmonary function, significant ascites, or pleural effusions. Post-Marketing Experience The following events have been identified during post-marketing use of irinotecan hydrochloride injection in clinical practice. Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan therapy. Infrequent cases of ulcerative and ischemic colitis have been observed. This can be complicated by ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection, including typhlitis. Patients experiencing ileus should receive prompt antibiotic support (see PRECAUTIONS section). Cases of megacolon, intestinal perforation, symptomatic pancreatitis, and asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have also been observed (see WARNINGS section). Cases of hyponatremia mostly related with diarrhea and vomiting have been reported. Increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis; transient increase of amylase and occasionally transient increase of lipase have been reported. Infrequent cases of renal insufficiency including acute renal failure, hypotension or circulatory failure have been observed in patients who experienced episodes of dehydration associated with diarrhea and/or vomiting, or sepsis (see WARNINGS section). Early effects such as muscular contraction or cramps and paresthesia have been reported. Hiccups have been reported. Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with irinotecan hydrochloride injection; in some cases, the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan."$$
"Drug-Drug Interactions Anticonvulsants: Exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 is substantially reduced in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine. The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these anticonvulsants has not been formally defined. The following drugs are also CYP3A4 inducers: rifampin, rifabutin. For patients requiring anticonvulsant treatment, consideration should be given to substituting non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of irinotecan therapy. Dexamethasone does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan. St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes. Exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is reduced in patients receiving concomitant St. John's Wort. St. John's Wort should be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the first cycle of irinotecan, and St. John's Wort is contraindicated during irinotecan therapy. Ketoconazole:Ketoconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes. Patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Patients should discontinue ketoconazole at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan therapy and ketoconazole is contraindicated during irinotecan therapy. Neuromuscular blocking agents. Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarizing drugs may be antagonized. Atazanavir sulfate: Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor has the potential to increase systemic exposure of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Physicians should take this into consideration when co-administering these drugs.",$$
"Drug Interactions The adverse effects of irinotecan hydrochloride injection, such as myelosuppression and diarrhea, would be expected to be exacerbated by other antineoplastic agents having similar adverse effects. Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. The concurrent administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection with irradiation has not been adequately studied and is not recommended. Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection, and it is possible that the administration of dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect. However, serious opportunistic infections have not been observed, and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia. Hyperglycemia has also been reported in patients receiving irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Usually, this has been observed in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of glucose intolerance prior to administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. It is probable that dexamethasone, given as antiemetic prophylaxis, contributed to hyperglycemia in some patients. The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when prochlorperazine was administered on the same day as irinotecan hydrochloride injection than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients). The 8.5% incidence of akathisia, however, is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies. It would be expected that laxative use during therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied. In view of the potential risk of dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea induced by irinotecan hydrochloride injection, the physician may wish to withhold diuretics during dosing with irinotecan hydrochloride injection and, certainly, during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea."$$
