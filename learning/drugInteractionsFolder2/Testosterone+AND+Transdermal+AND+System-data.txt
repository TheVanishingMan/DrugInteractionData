"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Worsening of BPH and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patient for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Warnings and Precaution (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Increases in serum PSA from baseline values were seen in approximately 18% of individuals in an open label study of 162 hypogonadal men treated with AndroGel for up to 42 months. Most of these increases were seen within the first year of therapy [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Testosterone Transfer to Others Transfer of testosterone to others (including women and children) can occur when vigorous skin-to-skin contact is made with the application site [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The following precautions are recommended to minimize potential transfer of testosterone from AndroGel-treated skin to another person: Patients should wash their hands immediately with soap and water after application of AndroGel. Patients should cover the application site(s) with clothing after the gel has dried (e.g., a shirt). In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which AndroGel has been applied does come in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible. In vitro studies show that residual testosterone is removed from the skin surface by washing with soap and water. Women and children should avoid skin contact with AndroGel application sites in males. Changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization should be brought to the attention of a physician. AndroGel may cause fetal harm in a pregnant woman due to virilization of a female fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.3 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.4 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.5 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel is not known to produce these adverse effects. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term oral therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. 5.6 Edema Drugs in the androgen class may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel, for hypogonadism. 5.8 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk for a thromboembolic event. Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Androgens should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.10 Flammable until Dry Alcohol Based Products including AndroGel are flammable; therefore avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to AndroGel 1.62%. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. AndroGel 1.62% should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified (5.2) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.5) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.7) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.9) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically (5.1, 5.3, 5.6, 5.10) AndroGel 1.62% is flammable until dry (5.13) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AndroGel 1.62% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel 1.62% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH possibly leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.6 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice).

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to FORTESTA. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. FORTESTA should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) FORTESTA is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patients for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using FORTESTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been Postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as FORTESTA. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with FORTESTA and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use FORTESTA. 5.6 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, FORTESTA is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including FORTESTA, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. FORTESTA is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including FORTESTA, may promote retention of sodium and water.

Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including testosterone gel 1%, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.12 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel 1%, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel 1%, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) Testosterone gel is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patients for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been Postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas.

In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after any dose increases. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Vogelxo, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Vogelxo, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including Vogelxo, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the Vogelxo has dried."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.3) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with the use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.4) Avoid exposure of women or children to ANDRODERM. (5.5) Exogenous administration of testosterone may lead to azoospermia. (5.6) Edema with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.8) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.10) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), liver function, lipid concentrations, hematocrit and hemoglobin periodically. (5.1, 5.2, 5.7, 5.11) Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI). Because ANDRODERM contains aluminum, it is recommended to remove the system before undergoing an MRI. (5.14) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating treatment. It is appropriate to re-evaluate patients 3 to 6 months after initiation of treatment, and then in accordance with prostate cancer screening practices [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.2 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It is appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then monitor annually. Discontinue testosterone therapy if the hematocrit becomes elevated. Testosterone therapy may be restarted when the hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.3 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as ANDRODERM. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with ANDRODERM and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use ANDRODERM. 5.5 Use in Women and Children Women and children should not use ANDRODERM. Use in women and children has not been studied with ANDRODERM. Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, ANDRODERM is not indicated for use in women and children [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 , 8.4 )]. 5.6 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, including ANDRODERM, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) that could lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including reduction of sperm count. 5.7 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. ANDRODERM is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.8 Edema Androgens, including ANDRODERM, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.9 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including ANDRODERM, for hypogonadism. 5.10 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity and chronic lung disease. 5.11 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.12 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including ANDRODERM, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.13 Decreased Thyroxine-Binding Globulin Androgens, including ANDRODERM, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentration and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentration remains unchanged and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.14 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI). Because ANDRODERM contains aluminum, it is recommended to remove the system before undergoing an MRI."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1). Secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women can occur with use of testosterone gel (5.2). Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported (6.2). Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application site(s) in men using testosterone gel. To minimize the potential for transfer to others, patients using AndroGel should apply the product as directed and strictly adhere to the following (5.2): Wash hands with soap and water after application. Cover the application site with clothing after the gel has dried. Wash the application site thoroughly with soap and water prior to any situation where skin-to-skin contact of the application site with another person is anticipated. Signs of virilization in children and women and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should be brought to the attention of the healthcare provider. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of the virilization is identified (5.2). Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women (5.3). Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.4). Edema may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.6, 6.2). Gynecomastia, enlargement of breast, may develop (5.7). Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.8). Monitor serum testosterone, prostatic specific antigen, hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function test, and lipid levels periodically (2.3, 5.1, 5.9). Alcohol-based gels are flammable until dry (5.10). 5.1 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patient for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate. Increases in serum PSA from baseline values were seen in approximately 18% of individuals in an open label study of 162 hypogonadal men treated with AndroGel for up to 42 months. Most of these increases were seen within the first year of therapy [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women can occur with testosterone gel use in men [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of testosterone gel. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. Testosterone may cause fetal harm in a pregnant woman due to virilization of a female fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Strict adherence to the following precautions is advised in order to minimize the potential for secondary exposure to testosterone from AndroGel-treated skin: Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application site(s) of men using testosterone gel. AndroGel should only be applied to the shoulders, upper arms, and/or abdomen (area of application should be limited to the area that will be covered by the patient's short sleeve t-shirt). Patients should wash their hands immediately with soap and water after applying AndroGel. Patients should cover the application site(s) with clothing (e.g., a shirt) after the gel has dried. Prior to any situation in which skin-to-skin contact with the application site is anticipated, patients should wash the application site(s) thoroughly with soap and water to remove any testosterone residue. In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which AndroGel has been applied comes in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible. Studies show that residual testosterone is removed from the skin surface by washing with soap and water. 5.3 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.4 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.5 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel is not known to produce these adverse effects. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term oral therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. 5.6 Edema Drugs in the androgen class may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel, for hypogonadism. 5.8 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk for a thromboembolic event. Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Androgens should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.10 Flammable Until Dry Alcohol Based Products including AndroGel are flammable; therefore avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. Table 2: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel in the 180-Day Controlled Clinical Trial ___________ Dose of AndroGel ___ Adverse Event ____________________ _ ___________ _________5 g________ _____ ______7.5 g________________ ________ 10 g____________ _______N = 77 _______ ____ N = 40 ________N = 78___________ Acne 1% 3% 8% Alopecia 1% 0% 1% Application Site Reaction 5% 3% 4% Asthenia 0% 3% 1% Depression 1% 0% 1% Emotional Lability 0% 3% 3% Gynecomastia 1% 0% 3% Headache 4% 3% 0% Hypertension 3% 0% 3% Lab Test Abnormal * 6% 5% 3% Libido Decreased 0% 3% 1% Nervousness 0% 3% 1% Pain Breast 1% 3% 1% Prostate Disorder ** 3% 3% 5% Testis Disorder *** 3% 0% 0% * Lab test abnormal occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. ** Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. *** Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis. Other less common adverse reactions, reported in fewer than 1% of patients included: amnesia, anxiety, discolored hair, dizziness, dry skin, hirsutism, hostility, impaired urination, paresthesia, penis disorder, peripheral edema, sweating, and vasodilation. In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension No AndroGel patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by greater than 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 + Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine.* Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. ** Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as greater than 2X the baseline or any single serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still less than 2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypogonadal Men Table 4 includes adverse reactions that have been identified postmarketing.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% of the Testim patients and greater than placebo) are application site reaction and increased hematocrit (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-663-0412 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with Testim(R) 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received Testim 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Subjects could be counted in both Testim treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels. Adverse reactions reported by >=1% of the Testim patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 1.

In this clinical trial of Testim, six patients had adverse reactions that led to their discontinuation. These events included: depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No Testim patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse reaction. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined US and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined US and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received testosterone gel for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No AndroGel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel 1% in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients.

Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%.

Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on testosterone gel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of testosterone gel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4). Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions from Postmarketing Experience of Testosterone Gel 1% by MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Elevated Hgb, Hct (polycythemia) Cardiovascular disorders: Myocardial infarction, stroke Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders and administration site reactions: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests (e.g. transaminases, elevated GGTP, bilirubin) Investigations: Elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium), changes in serum lipids (hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, decreased HDL), impaired glucose tolerance, fluctuating testosterone concentrations, weight increase Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (cysts and polyps): Prostate cancer Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, sleep apnea, insomnia Psychiatric disorders: Depression, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness, hostility, amnesia, anxiety Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, prostatic enlargement, testicular atrophy, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections) Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (pruritus, dry skin, erythema, rash, discolored hair, paresthesia), sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes), venous thromboembolism Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarket surveillance. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%) are acne, application site reaction, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders (6). Cases of testosterone secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported (6.2). Reported signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, premature development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel (5.2, 6.2). In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No AndroGel patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 5%) is an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Abbott Laboratories at 1-800-241-1643 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA >4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving AndroGel 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value >4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing. During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by >2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the AndroGel 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the AndroGel 1.62% treated group versus placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients in the 182-Day, Double-Blind Period of AndroGel 1.62% Clinical Trial * PSA increased includes: PSA values that met pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values (an average change from baseline > 0.75 ng/mL and/or an average PSA value >4.0 ng/mL based on two measurements) as well as those reported as adverse events. ** Emotional lability includes: mood swings, affective disorder, impatience, anger, and aggression. *** Contact dermatitis includes: 4 patients with dermatitis at non-application sites.

In the open-label period of the study (N=191), the most commonly reported adverse reaction (experienced by greater than 2% of patients) was increased PSA (n=13; 6.2%) and sinusitis. Other adverse reactions reported by less than or equal to 2% of patients included increased hemoglobin or hematocrit, hypertension, acne, libido decreased, insomnia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, 25 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (10.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 17 patients with PSA increased and 1 report each of: hematocrit increased, blood pressure increased, frequent urination, diarrhea, fatigue, pituitary tumor, dizziness, skin erythema and skin nodule (same patient - neither at application site), vasovagal syncope, and diabetes mellitus. During the 182-day, open-label period, 9 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 6 reports of PSA increased, 2 of hematocrit increased, and 1 each of triglycerides increased and prostate cancer. Application Site Reactions In the 182-day double-blind period of the study, application site reactions were reported in two (2/234; 0.9%) patients receiving AndroGel 1.62%, both of which resolved. Neither of these patients discontinued the study due to application site adverse reactions. In the open-label period of the study, application site reactions were reported in three (3/219; 1.4%) additional patients that were treated with AndroGel 1.62%. None of these subjects were discontinued from the study due to application site reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 5). Table 5: Adverse Reactions from Post Approval Experience of AndroGel 1% by System Organ Class * Impaired urination includes nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream ** Lab test abnormal includes elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, or elevated serum creatinine *** Testis disorder includes atrophy or non-palpable testis, varicocele, testis sensitivity or tenderness System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, polycythemia, anemia Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination* Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests Investigations: Lab test abnormal**, elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium [includes hypokalemia], phosphorus, sodium), impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, HDL, fluctuating testosterone levels, weight increase Neoplasms: Prostate cancer Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, insomnia, sleep apnea Psychiatric disorders: Amnesia, anxiety, depression, hostility, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections), prostate enlargement, BPH, testis disorder*** Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (discolored hair, dry skin, erythema, paresthesia, pruritus, rash), skin dry, pruritus, sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes) Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 5%) is an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie Inc. at 1-800-633-9110 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA >4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving AndroGel 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value >4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing. During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by >2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the AndroGel 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the AndroGel 1.62% treated group versus placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients in the 182-Day, Double-Blind Period of AndroGel 1.62% Clinical Trial * PSA increased includes: PSA values that met pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values (an average change from baseline > 0.75 ng/mL and/or an average PSA value >4.0 ng/mL based on two measurements) as well as those reported as adverse events. ** Emotional lability includes: mood swings, affective disorder, impatience, anger, and aggression. *** Contact dermatitis includes: 4 patients with dermatitis at non-application sites.

In the open-label period of the study (N=191), the most commonly reported adverse reaction (experienced by greater than 2% of patients) was increased PSA (n=13; 6.2%) and sinusitis. Other adverse reactions reported by less than or equal to 2% of patients included increased hemoglobin or hematocrit, hypertension, acne, libido decreased, insomnia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, 25 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (10.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 17 patients with PSA increased and 1 report each of: hematocrit increased, blood pressure increased, frequent urination, diarrhea, fatigue, pituitary tumor, dizziness, skin erythema and skin nodule (same patient - neither at application site), vasovagal syncope, and diabetes mellitus. During the 182-day, open-label period, 9 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 6 reports of PSA increased, 2 of hematocrit increased, and 1 each of triglycerides increased and prostate cancer. Application Site Reactions In the 182-day double-blind period of the study, application site reactions were reported in two (2/234; 0.9%) patients receiving AndroGel 1.62%, both of which resolved.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence > 3%) are application site reactions, and back pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Table 1 shows the adverse reactions that were reported by > 3% of 36 hypogonadal men who were treated with ANDRODERM 2 mg/day, 4 mg/day, or 6 mg/day for 28 days. Of note, all hypogonadal men studied had been stable users of topical testosterone replacement products prior to the study and there was no washout period between therapies. Furthermore, there was only one subject titrated to 6 mg/day and he withdrew from the study prematurely. Table 1.

The overall incidence of application site reactions of any kind was 28% (10 subjects with 13 adverse reactions). No serious adverse reactions to ANDRODERM 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day were reported during the clinical trial. Table 2 shows the adverse reactions that were reported in > 3% of 122 patients in clinical studies with ANDRODERM dosage strengths of 2.5 mg/day, 5 mg/day, and 7.5 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions reported were application site reactions. Transient mild to moderate erythema was observed at the site of application in the majority of patients at some time during treatment. The overall incidence of application site reactions of any kind was 48% (59 subjects with 107 adverse reactions). Table 2.

Other less common adverse reactions, reported in fewer than 1% of patients included: amnesia, anxiety, discolored hair, dizziness, dry skin, hirsutism, hostility, impaired urination, paresthesia, penis disorder, peripheral edema, sweating, and vasodilation. In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with Testosterone Gel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of Testosterone Gel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to Testosterone Gel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No Testosterone Gel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with Testosterone Gel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with Testosterone Gel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of Testosterone Gel in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on Testosterone Gel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post- baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Testosterone Gel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4).

Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Insulin Changes in insulin sensitivity or glycemic control may occur in patients treated with androgens. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements. 7.2 Corticosteroids The concurrent use of testosterone with ACTH or corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention and should be monitored cautiously, particularly in patients with cardiac, renal or hepatic disease. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens. More frequent monitoring of INR and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking anticoagulants, especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with Testim(R) 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received Testim(R) 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Patients with adverse events that were possibly or probably related to study drug and reported by >=1% of the Testim(R) patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 3.

In this clinical trial of Testim(R), six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: vertigo, coronary artery disease, depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection/pneumonia (none of which were considered related to Testim(R) administration), mood swings and hypertension. No Testim(R) patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 gm/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively. In the combined ongoing U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim(R) for at least 6 months. The preliminary results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCETestim(R) contains testosterone, a Schedule III controlled substance as defined by the Anabolic Steroids Control Act. Oral ingestion of Testim(R) will not result in clinically significant serum testosterone concentrations due to extensive first-pass metabolism."$$

The preliminary results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets (see WARNINGS)."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS In all clinical studies combined, a total of 308 patients were treated with Striant(R) for up to 12 months Twelve Week Trials In the pivotal, Phase 3, open-label controlled study (Study 1), 98 patients received Striant(R) for up to 12 weeks. Adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to the use of Striant(R) and reported by >/= 1% of patients in Study 1 are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Incidences of Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related Use of Striant(R) in Study 1 Adverse event Striant(R) (n=98) Gum or Mouth Irritation 9.2% Taste Bitter 4.1% Gum Pain 3.1% Gum Tenderness 3.1% Headache 3.1% Gum Edema 2.0% Taste Perversion 2.0% Please see \\\\"Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations\\\\" subsection for further information. The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days. The following adverse events judged possibly, probably or definitely related to the use of Striant(R) occurred in 1 patient each in Study 1: abdominal cramp, acne, anxiety, asthma (acute), breast enlargement, breast pain, buccal mucosal roughening, difficulty in micturition, fatigue, gingivitis, gum blister, gustatory sense diminished, hematocrit increased, lipids serum increased, liver function tests abnormal, nose edema, stinging of lips, and toothache. There was one additional 12-week study in 12 patients. In this study, additional adverse events judged at least possibly related to Striant(R) and reported by 1 patient each included emotional lability and hypertension. Long-Term Extension Trials In two long-term extension trials, a total of 117 and 51 patients received Striant(R) for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Of 117 patients treated for at least 6 months, adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and reported by 1 patient each included: anxiety, buccal inflammation, depression, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disorder, gum redness, hypertension, infection, medication error, nausea, pruritis, renal function abnormal, stomatitis, taste bitter, taste perversion, and toothache. Polycythemia and increased serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were reported in three and two patients, respectively. Adverse events reported in the 51 patients treated for at least one year were similar to those reported after 6 months of treatment and lower in incidence. Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations In the pivotal controlled study (Study 1), all reported gum-related adverse events were collected and gum examinations were conducted at Baseline and every month thereafter. In Study 1, a total of 16 patients reported 19 gum-related adverse events. Of these, ten patients (10.2%) reported 12 events of mild intensity, four patients (4.1%) reported 5 events of moderate intensity, and two patients (2.0%) reported 2 events of severe intensity. Most of these events were judged probably or definitely related to treatment with Striant(R). Four patients (4.1%) discontinued treatment with Striant(R) due to gum or mouth-related adverse events including two with severe gum irritation, one with mouth irritation, and one with \\\\"bad taste in mouth\\\\". The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days. In Study 1, monthly gum examinations were conducted to assess for gingivitis, gum edema, oral lesions, ulcerations or leukoplakia. No cases of ulceration or leukoplakia were observed. No new oral lesions were observed. Gingivitis was common at Baseline (32.6%), and was reduced at Week 4 (10.2%), Week 8 (10.2%) and Week 12 (11.2%). Similar findings were seen for gum edema. In the two long-term extension trials, gum examinations were conducted every 3 months while on treatment. In one of these trials, no patient had a gum abnormality, and in the other trial, moderate gingivitis and mild gum edema were reported by 1 patient each."$$

"Drug Interactions Oxyphenbutazone: Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. Insulin: In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements. Propranolol: In a published pharmacokinetic study of an injectable testosterone product, administration of testosterone cypionate led to an increased clearance of propranolol in the majority of men tested. It is unknown if this would apply to Testim(R). Corticosteroids: The concurrent administration of testosterone with ACTH or corticosteroids may enhance edema formation; thus these drugs should be administered cautiously, particularly in patients with cardiac or hepatic disease."$$
