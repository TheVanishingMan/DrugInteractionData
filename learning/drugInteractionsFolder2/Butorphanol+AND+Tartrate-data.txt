"ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience A total of 2446 patients were studied in premarketing clinical trials of butorphanol. Approximately half received butorphanol tartrate injection with the remainder receiving butorphanol tartrate nasal solution. In nearly all cases the type and incidence of side effects with butorphanol by any route were those commonly observed with opioid analgesics. The adverse experiences described below are based on data from short-term and long-term clinical trials in patients receiving butorphanol by any route. There has been no attempt to correct for placebo effect or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. The most frequently reported adverse experiences across all clinical trials were somnolence (43%), dizziness (19%), nausea and/or vomiting (13%). In long-term trials with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution only, nasal congestion (13%) and insomnia (11%) were frequently reported. The following adverse experiences were reported at a frequency of 1% or greater in clinical trials and were considered to be probably related to the use of butorphanol. Body as a Whole: asthenia/lethargy, headache, sensation of heat. Cardiovascular: vasodilation, palpitations. Digestive: anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, nausea and/or vomiting, stomach pain. Nervous: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, euphoria, floating feeling, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor. Respiratory: bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, nasal congestion, nasal irritation, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinus congestion, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection. Skin and Appendages: sweating/clammy, pruritus. Special Senses: blurred vision, ear pain, tinnitus, unpleasant taste. The following adverse experiences were reported with a frequency of less than 1% in clinical trials and were considered to be probably related to the use of butorphanol. Cardiovascular: hypotension, syncope. Nervous: abnormal dreams, agitation, dysphoria, hallucinations, hostility, withdrawal symptoms. Skin and Appendages: rash/hives. Urogenital: impaired urination. The following infrequent additional adverse experiences were reported in a frequency of less than 1% of the patients studied in short-term butorphanol tartrate nasal solution trials and under circumstances where the association between these events and butorphanol administration is unknown. They are being listed as alerting information for the physician. Body as a Whole: edema. Cardiovascular: chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia. Nervous: depression. Respiratory: shallow breathing. Postmarketing Experience Postmarketing experience with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution has shown an adverse event profile similar to that seen during the premarketing evaluation of butorphanol by all routes of administration. Adverse experiences that were associated with the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and that are not listed above have been chosen for inclusion below because of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or probable relationship to butorphanol. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These adverse experiences include apnea, convulsion, delusion, drug dependence, excessive drug effect associated with transient difficulty speaking and/or executing purposeful movements, overdose, and vertigo. Reports of butorphanol overdose with a fatal outcome have usually but not always been associated with ingestion of multiple drugs."$$

Androgen deficiency Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as symptoms of hypogonadism, such as impotence, erectile dysfunction, or amenorrhea. The causal role of opioids in the syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation."$$

"Drug Interactions Concurrent use of butorphanol with central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in increased central nervous system depressant effects. When used concurrently with such drugs, the dose of butorphanol should be the smallest effective dose and the frequency of dosing reduced as much as possible when administered concomitantly with drugs that potentiate the action of opioids. In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal solution were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1 mg dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution was administered 1 minute after a 20 mg dose of sumatriptan nasal solution. (The two drugs were administered in opposite nostrils.) When butorphanol tartrate nasal solution was administered 30 minutes after the sumatriptan nasal solution, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and Cmax decreased 18%. In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan affected by coadministration with butorphanol tartrate nasal solution. These results suggest that the analgesic effect of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution may be diminished when it is administered shortly after sumatriptan nasal solution, but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal. The safety of using butorphanol tartrate nasal solution and IMITREX(R) (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray during the same episode of migraine has not been established. However, it should be noted that both products are capable of producing transient increases in blood pressure. The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal solution were not affected by the coadministration of cimetidine (300 mg QID). Conversely, the administration of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution (1 mg butorphanol QID) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 300 mg dose of cimetidine. It is not known if the effects of butorphanol are altered by other concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (erythromycin, theophylline, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed. The fraction of butorphanol tartrate nasal solution absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline), but the rate of absorption is decreased. Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if butorphanol tartrate nasal solution is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a nasal vasoconstrictor.

It is not known if the effects of butorphanol are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (erythromycin, theophylline, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed. No information is available about the use of butorphanol concurrently with MAO inhibitors."$$

Central Nervous System Depressants Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of CNS depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs. Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see WARNINGS ]. Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome. [see PRECAUTIONS; INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS ] If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue butorphanol tartrate if serotonin syndrome is suspected."$$
