"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Accidental ingestion in pediatric patients may occur: Administer only under direct adult supervision.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 2047 subjects with inflammatory lesions of rosacea received SOOLANTRA cream once daily. A total of 1555 subjects were treated once daily for more than 12 weeks, and 519 for approximately one year. Adverse reactions, reported in <= 1% of subjects treated with SOOLANTRA cream for at least 3 months in vehicle-controlled clinical trials, included skin burning sensation and skin irritation. In controlled clinical trials with SOOLANTRA the most common adverse reactions (incidence <= 1 %) included skin burning sensation and skin irritation.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence <1%) are conjunctivitis, ocular hyperemia, eye irritation, dandruff, dry skin, and skin burning sensation. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. at 1-800-835-3592 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to a single 10 minute treatment of SKLICE Lotion in 379 patients, ages 6 months and older, in placebo-controlled trials. Of these subjects, 47 subjects were age 6 months to 4 years, 179 subjects were age 4 to 12 years, 56 subjects were age 12 to 16 years and 97 subjects were age 16 or older. Adverse reactions, reported in less than 1% of subjects treated with SKLICE Lotion, include conjunctivitis, ocular hyperemia, eye irritation, dandruff, dry skin, and skin burning sensation."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies have shown that SOOLANTRA cream, at therapeutic concentrations, neither inhibits nor induces cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Strongyloidiasis In four clinical studies involving a total of 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg of ivermectin, the following adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to ivermectin: Body as a Whole: asthenia/fatigue (0.9%), abdominal pain (0.9%) Gastrointestinal: anorexia (0.9%), constipation (0.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), nausea (1.8%), vomiting (0.9%) Nervous System/Psychiatric: dizziness (2.8%), somnolence (0.9%), vertigo (0.9%), tremor (0.9%) Skin: pruritus (2.8%), rash (0.9%), and urticaria (0.9%). In comparative trials, patients treated with ivermectin experienced more abdominal distention and chest discomfort than patients treated with albendazole. However, ivermectin was better tolerated than thiabendazole in comparative studies involving 37 patients treated with thiabendazole. The Mazzotti-type and ophthalmologic reactions associated with the treatment of onchocerciasis or the disease itself would not be expected to occur in strongyloidiasis patients treated with ivermectin (See ADVERSE REACTIONS, Onchocerciasis). Laboratory Test Findings In clinical trials involving 109 patients given either one or two doses of 170 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following laboratory abnormalities were seen regardless of drug relationship: elevation in ALT and/or AST (2%), decrease in leukocyte count (3%). Leukopenia and anemia were seen in one patient. Onchocerciasis In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients treated with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, worsening of the following Mazzotti reactions during the first 4 days post-treatment were reported: arthralgia/synovitis (9.3%), axillary lymph node enlargement and tenderness (11.0% and 4.4%, respectively), cervical lymph node enlargement and tenderness (5.3% and 1.2%, respectively), inguinal lymph node enlargement and tenderness (12.6% and 13.9%, respectively), other lymph node enlargement and tenderness (3.0% and 1.9%, respectively), pruritus (27.5%), skin involvement including edema, papular and pustular or frank urticarial rash (22.7%), and fever (22.6%) (See WARNINGS). In clinical trials, ophthalmological conditions were examined in 963 adult patients before treatment, at day 3, and months 3 and 6 after treatment with 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin. Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits. The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: limbitis: 5.5%, 4.8%, and 3.5% and punctate opacity: 1.8%, 1.8%, and 1.4%. The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: limbitis: 6.2%, 9.9%, and 9.4% and punctate opacity: 2.0%, 6.4%, and 7.2% (See WARNINGS). In clinical trials involving 963 adult patients who received 100 to 200 mcg/kg ivermectin, the following clinical adverse reactions were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in >=1% of the patients: facial edema (1.2%), peripheral edema (3.2%), orthostatic hypotension (1.1%), and tachycardia (3.5%). Drug-related headache and myalgia occurred in <1% of patients (0.2% and 0.4%, respectively). However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality (22.3% and 19.7%, respectively). A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 13. The following ophthalmological side effects do occur due to the disease itself but have also been reported after treatment with ivermectin: abnormal sensation in the eyes, eyelid edema, anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis, limbitis, keratitis, and chorioretinitis or choroiditis. These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Test Findings In controlled clinical trials, the following laboratory adverse experiences were reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug in >=1% of the patients: eosinophilia (3%) and hemoglobin increase (1%). Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: Onchocerciasis Conjunctival hemorrhage All Indications Hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension), worsening of bronchial asthma, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures, hepatitis, elevation of liver enzymes, and elevation of bilirubin."$$
