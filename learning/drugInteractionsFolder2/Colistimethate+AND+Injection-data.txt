"Drug Interactions Certain other antibiotics (aminoglycosides and polymyxin) have also been reported to interfere with the nerve transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Based on this reported activity, they should not be given concomitantly with Colistimethate for Injection except with greatest caution. Curariform muscle relaxants (e.g., tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium, and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with Colistimethate for Injection. Sodium cephalothin may enhance the nephrotoxicity of Colistimethate for Injection. The concomitant use of sodium cephalothin and Colistimethate for Injection should be avoided."$$
