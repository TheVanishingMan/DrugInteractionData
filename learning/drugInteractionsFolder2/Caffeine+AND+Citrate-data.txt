"ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly Observed The most commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) and not reported at an equivalent incidence by placebo-treated patients were nausea and/or abdominal pain, drowsiness and dizziness. Associated with Treatment Discontinuation Of the 382 patients treated with ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) in controlled clinical trials, three (0.8%) discontinued treatment with ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) because of adverse events. One patient each discontinued treatment for the following reasons: gastrointestinal upset; lightheadedness and heavy eyelids; and drowsiness and generalized tingling. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The following table summarizes the incidence rates of the adverse events reported by at least 1% of the ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) treated patients in controlled clinical trials comparing ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) to placebo, and provides a comparison to the incidence rates reported by the placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.

All reported adverse events, except those already presented in the previous table, are included. It is important to emphasize that, although the adverse events reported did occur while the patient was receiving ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), the adverse events were not necessarily caused by ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP). Adverse events are classified by body system and frequency, \\\\"Frequent\\\\" is defined as an adverse event which occurred in at least 1/100 (1%) of the patients; all adverse events listed in the previous table are frequent. \\\\"Infrequent\\\\" is defined as an adverse event that occurred in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients. All adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent. Central Nervous System: headache, shaky feeling, tingling, agitation, fainting, fatigue, heavy eyelids, high energy, hot spells, numbness and sluggishness. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth and hyperhidrosis. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and heartburn. Cardiovascular: tachycardia. Musculoskeletal: leg pain and muscle fatigue. Genitourinary: diuresis. Miscellaneous: pruritus, fever, earache, nasal congestion, and tinnitus. Voluntary reports of adverse drug events, temporally associated with ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), that have been received since market introduction and that were not reported in clinical trials by the patients treated with ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP), are listed below. Many or most of these events may have no causal relationship with the drug and are listed according to body system. Central Nervous System: abuse, addiction, anxiety, depression, disorientation, hallucination, hyperactivity, insomnia, libido decrease, nervousness, neuropathy, psychosis, sedation, sexual activity increase, slurred speech, twitching, unconsciousness, vertigo. Autonomic Nervous System: epistaxis, flushing, miosis, salivation. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, appetite increased, constipation, diarrhea, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal spasm, hiccup, mouth burning, pyloric ulcer.

Urinary: kidney impairment, urinary difficulty. Miscellaneous: allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock, cholangiocarcinoma, drug interaction with erythromycin (stomach upset), edema. The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of the components of ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP). Potential effects of high dosage are listed in the OVERDOSAGE section of this insert. Aspirin: occult blood loss, hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, gastric distress, heartburn, nausea, peptic ulcer, prolonged bleeding time, acute airway obstruction, renal toxicity when taken in high doses for prolonged periods, impaired urate excretion, hepatitis. Caffeine: cardiac stimulation, irritability, tremor, dependence, nephrotoxicity, hyperglycemia. Codeine: nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, lightheadedness, constipation, pruritus."$$

ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCURRED MORE FREQUENTLY IN CAFFEINE CITRATE TREATED PATIENTS THAN PLACEBO DURING DOUBLE-BLIND THERAPY Adverse Event (AE) Caffeine Citrate N=46 Placebo N=39 n (%) n (%) BODY AS A WHOLE Accidental Injury 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) Feeding Intolerance 4 (8.7) 2 (5.1) Sepsis 2 (4.3) 0 (0.0) CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hemorrhage 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Necrotizing Enterocolitis 2 (4.3) 1 (2.6) Gastritis 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) METABOLIC AND NUTRITIVE DISORDERS Acidosis 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) Healing Abnormal 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) NERVOUS SYSTEM Cerebral Hemorrhage 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Dyspnea 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) Lung Edema 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) SKIN AND APPENDAGES Dry Skin 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) Rash 4 (8.7) 3 (7.7) Skin Breakdown 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) SPECIAL SENSES Retinopathy of Prematurity 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) UROGENITAL SYSTEM Kidney Failure 1 (2.2) 0 (0.0) In addition to the cases above, three cases of necrotizing enterocolitis were diagnosed in patients receiving caffeine citrate during the open-label phase of the study. Three of the infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis during the trial died. All had been exposed to caffeine. Two were randomized to caffeine, and one placebo patient was "rescued" with open-label caffeine for uncontrolled apnea. Adverse events described in the published literature include: central nervous system stimulation (i.e., irritability, restlessness, jitteriness), cardiovascular effects (i.e., tachycardia, increased left ventricular output, and increased stroke volume), gastrointestinal effects (i.e., increased gastric aspirate, gastrointestinal intolerance), alterations in serum glucose (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) and renal effects (increased urine flow rate, increased creatinine clearance, and increased sodium and calcium excretion). Published long-term follow-up studies have not shown caffeine to adversely affect neurological development or growth parameters.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets are those seen with aspirin and caffeine or those usually associated with mild anticholinergic agents. These may include tachycardia, palpitation, urinary hesitancy or retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular tension, weakness, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, constipation, drowsiness, and rarely, urticaria and other dermatoses. Infrequently, an elderly patient may experience some degree of confusion. Mild central excitation and occasional hallucinations may be observed. These mild side effects can usually be eliminated by reduction in dosage. One case of aplastic anemia associated with the use of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets has been reported. No causal relationship has been established. Rare G.I. hemorrhage due to aspirin content may be associated with the administration of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets. Some patients may experience transient episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions are drowsiness and dizziness. Less frequent adverse reactions are lightheadedness and gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, and flatulence. A single incidence of bone marrow suppression has been reported with the use of butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules. Several cases of dermatological reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported."$$

"Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of caffeine. Therefore, caffeine has the potential to interact with drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2, or induce CYP1A2. Few data exist on drug interactions with caffeine in preterm neonates. Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministra\\302\\255tion of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimeti\\302\\255dine and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbi\\302\\255tal and phenytoin). Caffeine administered concurrently with ketoprofen reduced the urine volume in four healthy volunteers. The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known. Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates. The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended."$$

"Drug Interactions The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of aspirin, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in salicylism because corticosteroids enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal is followed by return to normal rates of renal clearance. ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) may enhance the effects of: Oral anticoagulants, causing bleeding by inhibiting prothrombin formation in the liver and displacing anticoagulants from plasma protein binding sites. Oral antidiabetic agents and insulin, causing hypoglycemia by contributing an additive effect, if dosage of ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) exceeds maximum recommended daily dosage. 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, causing bone marrow toxicity and blood dyscrasias by displacing these drugs from secondary binding sites, and, in the case of methotrexate, also reducing its excretion. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, increasing the risk of peptic ulceration and bleeding by contributing addictive effects. Other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression. ASCOMP(R) with Codeine (Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP) may diminish the effects of: Uricosuric agents such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, reducing their effectiveness in the treatment of gout. Aspirin competes with these agents for protein binding sites."$$
