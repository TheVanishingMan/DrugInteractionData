"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Consider decreasing or stopping dexmedetomidine HCl infusion; decreasing or stopping other medications that depress sinus node function; administering anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine); and/or administering pressor agents. (5.1) - Hypotension: Consider decreasing or stopping dexmedetomidine HCl infusion; increasing rate of intravenous fluid administration; elevating lower extremities, and/or administering pressor agents. (5.2) - Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during administration of loading dose. Consider reducing loading infusion rate. (5.3) - Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. (5.4) -Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events. (5.6) 5.1 Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest Bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or following rapid intravenous or bolus administration of dexmedetomidine HCl. Bradycardia has also been reported in association with intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine HCl. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. Dexmedetomidine HCl decreases sympathetic nervous system activity and has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli. Elderly patients and patients with advanced heart block, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, and/or chronic hypertension are at increased risk of bradycardia following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl. Closely monitor heart rate and other hemodynamic parameters during administration of dexmedetomidine HCl. In patients who develop bradycardia, consider decreasing or stopping the dexmedetomidine HCl infusion; decreasing or stopping other medications that depress the sinus node function; administering anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) to modify vagal tone; and/or administering pressor agents. In patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures may be required. 5.2 Hypotension Hypotension has been reported in association with intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine HCl. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. Elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] and patients with advanced heart block, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, and/or chronic hypertension are at increased risk of hypotension following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl. Closely monitor blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters during administration of dexmedetomidine HCl. If hypotension occurs, consider decreasing or stopping the dexmedetomidine HCl infusion; increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration; elevating the lower extremities; and/or administering pressor agents. 5.3 Transient Hypertension 5.4 Arousability Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine HCl have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms. 5.5 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of infusions of dexmedetomidine HCl less than 6 hours in duration. 5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis"$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitoring: Continuously monitor patients while receiving dexmedetomidine. (5.1) Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g., rapid intravenous or bolus administration. (5.2) Hypotension and Bradycardia: May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction. (5.2) Co-administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents: Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects. (5.2) Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate. (5.3) Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. (5.4) Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events. (5.6) 5.1 Drug Administration Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving dexmedetomidine. 5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with dexmedetomidine administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration. Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with dexmedetomidine infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of dexmedetomidine, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because dexmedetomidine has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required. Caution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because dexmedetomidine decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients. In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with dexmedetomidine an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with dexmedetomidine. 5.3 Transient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable. 5.4 Arousability Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms. 5.5 Withdrawal Procedural Sedation In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of dexmedetomidine (<6 hours). 5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Since dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."$$

This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms. 5.5 Withdrawal Intensive Care Unit Sedation With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation. In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex supportive therapy is indicated. Procedural Sedation In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Precedex (<6 hours). 5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].",$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: -Bradycardia and sinus arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Transient hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 2%) were hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia.

Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation in which 318 adult patients received dexmedetomidine HCl (Studies 1 and 2) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 mcg/kg to 6.7 mcg/kg), mean dosage per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hour (range: 0.3 mcg/kg/hour to 6.1 mcg/kg/hour) and the mean duration of infusion was 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 hour to 6.2 hours). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, 30% greater than or equal to 65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. Adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of greater than 2% of patients receiving dexmedetomidine HCl and at an incidence greater than placebo are provided in Table 2. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between dexmedetomidine HCl and comparator groups in both studies.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of dexmedetomidine HCl during post approval use.

Consider reducing the dosage of dexmedetomidine HCl or the co-administered drug. 7.2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Dexmedetomidine HCl Dexmedetomidine HCl had no clinically meaningful effect on the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with dexmedetomidine HCl an additive hypotensive or bradycardic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) is recommended if other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents are co-administered with dexmedetomidine HCl."$$

Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride or the concomitant medication may be required. (7.1) 7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids Co-administration of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine hydrochloride and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated.
