"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been reported. If either occurs, discontinue until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize (5.1) Topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome and unmask latent diabetes (5.2) Rate of adrenal suppression increased with treatment duration (5.2) Systemic absorption may require evaluation for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (5.2) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop (5.2) Potent corticosteroids, use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption (5.1) Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids (5.3, 6.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids (5.2, 8.4) 5.1 Effects on Calcium Metabolism Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The effects of Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of more than 8 weeks have not been evaluated. 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. In a study of 32 subjects treated with Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex(R) Ointment on the body, adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18.2%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics (12.2)] Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] 5.3 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.6 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.7 Unevaluated Uses The safety and efficacy of Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension in patients with known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism have not been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension in patients with erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis have not been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension in patients with severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic disorders have not been evaluated. 5.8 Eye Exposures Avoid eye exposures. Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension may cause eye irritation. 5.9 Ultraviolet Light Exposures Patients who apply Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension to exposed skin (e.g. a bald scalp) should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy to the scalp in patients who use Taclonex Scalp(R) Topical Suspension."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed. If either occurs, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism normalize (5.1) Taclonex(R) Ointment can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of treatment. Risk factors include the use of high-potency topical corticosteroid, use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and use in pediatric patients. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.2, 8.4) 5.1 Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been observed with use of Taclonex(R) Ointment. If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, treatment should be discontinued until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. In the trials that included assessment of the effects of Taclonex(R) Ointment on calcium metabolism, such testing was done after 4 weeks of treatment. The effects of Taclonex(R) Ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been evaluated. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] 5.2 Effects on Endocrine System Taclonex(R) Ointment can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, concomitant use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the cosyntropin stimulation test. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension and Taclonex(R) Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex(R) Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The effects of Taclonex(R) Ointment on the HPA axis following treatment durations of longer than 4 weeks have not been adequately studied. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effects of topical corticosteroids. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their higher skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Skin Irritation If irritation develops, treatment with Taclonex(R) Ointment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.6 Risk of Ultraviolet Light Exposure Patients who apply Taclonex(R) Ointment to exposed skin should avoid excessive exposure to either natural or artificial sunlight, including tanning booths, sun lamps, etc. Physicians may wish to limit or avoid use of phototherapy in patients who use Taclonex(R) Ointment."$$

In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension and Taclonex(R) Ointment on the HPA axis, 32 adult subjects were treated with both Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension on the scalp and Taclonex(R) Ointment on the body. Adrenal suppression was identified in 5 of 32 subjects (16%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in 2 of 11 subjects (18%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks. In another trial of 43 subjects treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension on body (including the scalp in 36 out of 43 subjects) adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 43 subjects (7%) after 4 weeks of treatment and in none of the 36 subjects who continued treatment for 8 weeks. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] In a trial evaluating the effects of Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension on the HPA axis, 31 subjects aged 12 to 17 years were treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension on the scalp. Adrenal suppression was identified in 1 of 30 evaluable subjects (3.3%) after 4 weeks of treatment.

Taclonex(R) Ointment was studied primarily in placebo- and active-controlled trials (N = 1176, and N = 1272, respectively). The population was 15-97 years old, 61% males and 39% females, mostly white (97%) and had a baseline disease severity ranging from mild to very severe. Most subjects received once daily application, and the median weekly dose was 24.5 g. The percentage of subjects reporting at least one adverse event was 27.1% in the Taclonex(R) Ointment group, 33.0% in the calcipotriene group, 28.3% in the betamethasone group, and 33.4% in the vehicle group.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>= 1%) are folliculitis and burning sensation of skin (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact LEO Pharma Inc. at 1-877-494-4536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directed compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Scalp Psoriasis The rates of adverse reactions given below were derived from randomized, multicenter, prospective vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with scalp psoriasis. Subjects applied study product once daily for 8 weeks, and the median weekly dose was 12.6 g. Adverse reactions that occurred in >=1% of subjects treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension and at a rate higher than in subjects treated with vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Number and Percentage with Adverse Reactions in Scalp Psoriasis Trials (Events Reported by >=1% of Subjects and for Which a Relationship is Possible) Taclonex (R) Topical Suspension N=1,953 Betamethasone dipropionate in vehicle N=1,214 Calcipotriene in vehicle N=979 Vehicle N=173 Event # of subjects (%) Folliculitis 16 (1%) 12 (1%) 5 (1%) 0 (0%) Burning sensation of skin 13 (1%) 10 (1%) 29 (3%) 0 (0%) Other less common adverse reactions (<1% but >0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence: acne, exacerbation of psoriasis, eye irritation, and pustular rash. In a 52-week trial, adverse reactions that were reported by >1% of subjects treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension were pruritus (3.6%), psoriasis (2.4%), erythema (2.1%), skin irritation (1.4%), and folliculitis (1.2%). Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Psoriasis on the Body In randomized, multicenter, prospective vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis on non-scalp areas, subjects applied study product once daily for 8 weeks. A total of 824 subjects were treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension and the median weekly dose was 22.6 g. There were no adverse reactions that occurred in >=1% of subjects treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension and at a rate higher than in subjects treated with vehicle. Other less common adverse reactions (<1% but >0.1%) were, in decreasing order of incidence: rash and folliculitis. Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 12 to 17 years with Scalp Psoriasis In two uncontrolled prospective clinical trials, a total of 109 subjects aged 12-17 years with plaque psoriasis of the scalp were treated with Taclonex(R) Topical Suspension once daily for up to 8 weeks. The median weekly dose was 40 g. Adverse reactions included acne, acneiform dermatitis and application site pruritus (0.9% each). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Postmarketing reports for local adverse reactions to topical corticosteroids may also include: atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, itching, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria."$$
