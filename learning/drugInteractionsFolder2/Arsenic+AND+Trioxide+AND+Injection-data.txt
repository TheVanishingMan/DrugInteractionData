"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: During TRISENOX therapy, maintain potassium, concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL. (5.2) -Carcinogenesis: Arsenic trioxide is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. (5.3) -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) -Laboratory Tests: Monitor patient's electrolyte, hematologic and coagulation profiles and obtain ECGs. (5.5) 5.1 APL Differentiation Syndrome Nine of 40 patients with APL treated with TRISENOX, at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg, experienced the APL differentiation syndrome. High-dose steroids have been administered at the first suspicion of the APL differentiation syndrome and appear to mitigate signs and symptoms. At the first signs that could suggest the syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnea and/or weight gain, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities), high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously BID) should be immediately initiated, irrespective of the leukocyte count, and continued for at least 3 days or longer until signs and symptoms have abated. The majority of patients do not require termination of TRISENOX therapy during treatment of the APL differentiation syndrome. [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.2 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: Torsade de Pointes, Complete Heart Block, and QT Prolongation Torsade de pointes and complete heart block have been reported. QT/QTc prolongation can occur. Sixteen of 40 patients (40%) had at least one ECG tracing with a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. Prolongation of the QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after TRISENOX infusion, and then returned towards baseline by the end of 8 weeks after TRISENOX infusion. Prior to initiating therapy with TRISENOX, a 12-lead ECG should be performed and serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) and creatinine should be assessed. Preexisting electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected and, if possible, drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval should be discontinued. If it's not possible to discontinue the interacting drug, perform cardiac monitoring frequently [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor ECG weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable patients. For QTc greater than 500 msec, complete corrective measures and reassess the QTc with serial ECGs prior to initiating TRISENOX. During TRISENOX therapy, maintain potassium concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL. Reassess patients who reach an absolute QT interval value > 500 msec and immediately correct concomitant risk factors, if any, while the risk/benefit of continuing versus suspending TRISENOX therapy should be considered. There are no data on the effect of TRISENOX on the QTc interval during the infusion. The risk may be increased when TRISENOX is coadministered with medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.3 Carcinogenesis The active ingredient of TRISENOX, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity TRISENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m\\302\\262 basis. A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m\\302\\262 basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m\\302\\262 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TRISENOX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1,8.3)]. 5.5 Laboratory Tests The patient's electrolyte and glucose levels, as well as hepatic, renal, hematologic and coagulation profiles should be monitored at least twice weekly, and more frequently for clinically unstable patients during the induction phase and at least weekly during the consolidation phase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions have been associated with TRISENOX in clinical trials and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. -APL Differentiation Syndrome[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] -Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: Torsade de Pointes, Complete Heart Block, and QT Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Laboratory Tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions in patients with relapsed or refractory APL were leukocytosis, gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), fatigue, edema, hyperglycemia, dyspnea, cough, rash or itching, headaches, and dizziness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety information was available for 52 patients with relapsed or refractory APL who participated in clinical trials of TRISENOX. Forty patients in the Phase 2 study received the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg of which 28 completed both induction and consolidation treatment cycles. An additional 12 patients with relapsed or refractory APL received doses generally similar to the recommended dose. Most patients experienced some drug-related toxicity, most commonly leukocytosis, gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), fatigue, edema, hyperglycemia, dyspnea, cough, rash or itching, headaches, and dizziness. These adverse effects have not been observed to be permanent or irreversible nor do they usually require interruption of therapy. Serious adverse events (SAEs), Grade 3/4 according to version 2 of the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, were common. Those SAEs attributed to TRISENOX in the Phase 2 study of 40 patients with refractory or relapsed APL included APL differentiation syndrome (n=3), hyperleukocytosis (n=3), QTc interval >= 500 msec (n=16, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial dysrhythmias (n=2), and hyperglycemia (n=2). Table 1 describes the adverse events that were observed in patients, between the ages of 5-73 years, treated for APL with TRISENOX at the recommended dose at a rate of 5% or more. Similar adverse event profiles were seen in the other patient populations who received TRISENOX.

Pulmonary edema (n=1) and caecitis (n=1) were considered serious reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been reported from clinical trials and/or worldwide postmarketing surveillance. Because they are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made. Cardiac disorders: ventricular extrasystoles in association with QT prolongation, and ventricular tachycardia in association with QT prolongation. Nervous system disorders: peripheral neuropathy Hematologic disorders: pancytopenia Investigations: gamma-glutamyltransferase increased Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: A differentiation syndrome, like retinoic acid syndrome, has been reported with the use of TRISENOX for the treatment of malignancies other than APL [see Boxed Warning]."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs That Can Prolong the QT/QTc Interval Concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX may increase the risk of serious QT/QTc interval prolongation. Discontinue or replace with an alternative drug that does not prolong the QT/QTc interval while patient is using TRISENOX. Monitor ECGs more frequently in patients when it is not feasible to avoid concomitant use. Drugs That Can Lead to Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities increase the risk of serious QT/QTc interval prolongation. Avoid concomitant administration of drugs that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Monitor electrolytes more frequently in patients who must receive concomitant use of these drugs and TRISENOX."$$
