"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene capsules causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. (5.1, 5.11) -Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene capsules and evaluate if suspected. (5.2) -Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene capsules and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. (5.3) -Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene capsules therapy can cause hypothyroidism. Monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed (5.5) -Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene capsules dose or interrupt as indicated. (5.6) -Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. (5.10) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene capsules induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of >300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day or greater than 300 mg/m2/day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day or greater than 300 mg/m2/day, respectively, of bexarotene capsules. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene capsules therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene capsules is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene capsules therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene capsules. In the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene capsules [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene capsules; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene capsules and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene capsules caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene capsules if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene capsules induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC x 106/L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene capsules developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 106/L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene capsules. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominantly neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m2/day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene capsules therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene capsules and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene capsules who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to <15,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene capsules could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene capsules as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene capsules. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene capsules. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene capsules therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene capsules therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene capsules therapy."$$

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene capsules has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene capsules for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene capsules dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m2/day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene capsules as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m2/day to 1000 mg/m2/day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene capsules as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2-4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena. Hemic and Lymphatic: eosinophilia, thrombocythemia, coagulation time increased, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional: LDH increased, creatinine increased, hypoproteinemia, hyperglycemia, weight decreased, weight increased, and amylase increased. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, bone pain, myasthenia, and arthrosis. Nervous: depression, agitation, ataxia, cerebrovascular accident, confusion, dizziness, hyperesthesia, hypesthesia, and neuropathy. Respiratory: pharyngitis, rhinitis, dyspnea, pleural effusion, bronchitis, cough increased, lung edema, hemoptysis, and hypoxia.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (>800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene capsules 300 or 150 mg/m2/day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene capsules 300 mg/m2/day group than in bexarotene capsules 150 mg/m2/day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively.

The safety of TARGRETIN has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received TARGRETIN for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of TARGRETIN are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to TARGRETIN dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of TARGRETIN (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m2/day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received TARGRETIN as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m2/day to 1000 mg/m2/day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received TARGRETIN as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of TARGRETIN, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2-4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena. Hemic and Lymphatic: eosinophilia, thrombocythemia, coagulation time increased, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional: LDH increased, creatinine increased, hypoproteinemia, hyperglycemia, weight decreased, weight increased, and amylase increased. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, bone pain, myasthenia, and arthrosis. Nervous: depression, agitation, ataxia, cerebrovascular accident, confusion, dizziness, hyperesthesia, hypesthesia, and neuropathy. Respiratory: pharyngitis, rhinitis, dyspnea, pleural effusion, bronchitis, cough increased, lung edema, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Skin and Appendages: skin ulcer, acne, alopecia, skin nodule, macular papular rash, pustular rash, serous drainage, and vesicular bullous rash. Special Senses: dry eyes, conjunctivitis, ear pain, blepharitis, corneal lesion, keratitis, otitis externa, and visual field defect. Urogenital: albuminuria, hematuria, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, dysuria, and kidney function abnormal.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (>800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the TARGRETIN 300 or 150 mg/m2/day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the TARGRETIN 300 mg/m2/day group than in TARGRETIN 150 mg/m2/day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the TARGRETIN 300 mg/m2/day group than in the TARGRETIN 150 mg/m2/day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."$$

Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene capsules is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene Capsules on Other Drugs Bexarotene capsules may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of Targretin capsules has been evaluated in clinical studies of 152 patients with CTCL who received Targretin capsules for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other studies. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of Targretin capsules are shown in Table 1. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a higher incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day (see Table 1). Adverse events leading to dose reduction or study drug discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The moderately severe (NCI Grade 3) and severe (NCI Grade 4) adverse events reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of Targretin capsules (see Table 2) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m2/day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m2/day. As shown in Table 3, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively. In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m2/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL studies, 352 patients received Targretin capsules as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m2/day to 1000 mg/m2/day. The common adverse events (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received Targretin capsules as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse events that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day of Targretin capsules, adverse events reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 1-3 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, sepsis, and monilia. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena. Hemic and Lymphatic: eosinophilia, thrombocythemia, coagulation time increased, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional: LDH increased, creatinine increased, hypoproteinemia, hyperglycemia, weight decreased, weight increased, and amylase increased. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia, bone pain, myasthenia, and arthrosis. Nervous: depression, agitation, ataxia, cerebrovascular accident, confusion, dizziness, hyperesthesia, hypesthesia, and neuropathy. Respiratory: pharyngitis, rhinitis, dyspnea, pleural effusion, bronchitis, cough increased, lung edema, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Skin and Appendages: skin ulcer, acne, alopecia, skin nodule, macular papular rash, pustular rash, serous drainage, and vesicular bullous rash. Special Senses: dry eyes, conjunctivitis, ear pain, blepharitis, corneal lesion, keratitis, otitis externa, and visual field defect. Urogenital: albuminuria, hematuria, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, dysuria, kidney function abnormal, and breast pain. Table 1.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of Targretin(R) gel has been assessed in clinical studies of 117 patients with CTCL who received Targretin(R) gel for up to 172 weeks. In the multicenter open-label study, 50 patients with CTCL received Targretin(R) gel for up to 98 weeks. The mean duration of therapy for these 50 patients was 199 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence at the application site of at least 10% in patients with CTCL were rash, pruritus, skin disorder, and pain. Adverse events leading to dose reduction or study drug discontinuation in at least two patients were rash, contact dermatitis, and pruritus. Of the 49 patients (98%) who experienced any adverse event, most experienced events categorized as mild (9 patients, 18%) or moderate (27 patients, 54%). There were 12 patients (24%) who experienced at least one moderately severe adverse event. The most common moderately severe events were rash (7 patients, 14%) and pruritus (3 patients, 6%). Only one patient (2%) experienced a severe adverse event (rash). In the patients with CTCL receiving Targretin(R) gel, adverse events reported regardless of relationship to study drug at an incidence of >=5% are presented in Table 1. A similar safety profile for Targretin(R) gel was demonstrated in the Phase I-II program. For the 67 patients enrolled in the Phase I-II program, the mean duration of treatment was 436 days (range 12-1203 days). As in the multicenter study, the most common adverse events regardless of relationship to study drug in the Phase I-II program were rash (78%), pain (40%), and pruritus (40%). Table 1.

"Drug-Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of Targretin capsules and gemfibrozil resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with Targretin capsules is not recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions ). Coadministration of paclitaxel plus carboplatin with Targretin capsules increased bexarotene AUC by 2-fold. Caution should be excerisized when Targretin capsules are concomitantly administered with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions ). Concomitant administration of Targretin capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen. The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin decreased by half when atorvastatin was coadministered with Targretin. This suggest that Targretin is an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and that it may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4, including oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions and CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy: Category X ). Thus, if treatment with Targretin capsules is intended in a woman with child-bearing potential, it is strongly recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used concurrently, one of which should be non-hormonal."$$
"Drug-Drug Interactions Patients who are applying Targretin(R) gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products. An animal toxicology study showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as part of the formulation. No formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. Bexarotene oxidative metabolites appear to be formed through cytochrome P450 3A4. On the basis of the metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4, concomitant ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and grapefruit juice could increase bexarotene plasma concentrations. Similarly, based on data that gemfibrozil increases bexarotene concentrations following oral bexarotene administration, concomitant gemfibrozil could increase bexarotene plasma concentrations. However, due to the low systemic exposure to bexarotene after low to moderately intense gel regimens (see Clinical Pharmacology), increases that occur are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to result in adverse effects. No drug interaction data are available on concomitant administration of Targretin(R) gel and other CTCL therapies."$$
"Drug-Food Interaction In all clinical trials, patients were instructed to take Bexarotene capsules with or immediately following a meal. In one clinical study, plasma bexarotene AUC and Cmax values were substantially higher following a fat-containing meal versus those following the administration of a glucose solution. Because safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that Bexarotene capsules be administered with food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."$$
