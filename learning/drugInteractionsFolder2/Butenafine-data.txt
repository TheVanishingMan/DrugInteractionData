"ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials, 9 (approximately 1%) of 815 patients treated with Mentax(R) Cream, 1%, reported adverse events related to the skin. These included burning/stinging, itching and worsening of the condition. No patient treated with Mentax(R) Cream, 1%, discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. In the vehicle-treated patients, 2 of 718 patients discontinued because of treatment site adverse events, one of which was severe burning/stinging and itching at the site of application. In uncontrolled clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse events in patients treated with Mentax(R) Cream, 1%, were: contact dermatitis, erythema, irritation, and itching, each occurring in less than 2% of patients. In provocative testing in over 200 subjects, there was no evidence of allergic-contact sensitization for either cream or vehicle base for Mentax(R) Cream, 1%."$$
