"ADVERSE REACTIONS Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions and hallucinations, plus one doubtful case of paranoia all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with trihexyphenidyl. Patients with arteriosclerosis or with a history of idiosyncrasy to other drugs may exhibit reactions of mental confusion, agitation, disturbed behavior, or nausea and vomiting. Such patients should be allowed to develop a tolerance through the initial administration of a small dose and gradual increase in dose until an effective level is reached. If a severe reaction should occur, administration of the drug should be discontinued for a few days and then resumed at a lower dosage. Psychiatric disturbances can result from indiscriminate use (leading to overdosage) to sustain continued euphoria. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs include constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular tension, weakness, vomiting, and headache. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma due to long-term treatment with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride has been reported."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Minor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with trihexyphenidyl HCl than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unalleviated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been reported rarely with trihexyphenidyl HCl. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including trihexyphenidyl HCl, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion and memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular pressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. Exacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment withdrawal has been reported (see WARNINGS, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome). The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving trihexyphenidyl HCl has been reported (blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus bradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to adverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been reported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, forgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations."$$

"Drug Interactions Cannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with trihexyphenidyl, and thus, an abuse potential exists. Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with trihexyphenidyl may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as trihexyphenidyl, as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics (See PRECAUTIONS, General ). The usual dose of either trihexyphenidyl or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."$$
