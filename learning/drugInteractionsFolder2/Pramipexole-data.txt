Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack) such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day) for Parkinson's disease. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. Postmarketing reports with medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride or after starting or increasing the dose of pramipexole dihydrochloride. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3.0 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$

Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. In placebo-controlled clinical trials in Parkinson's disease, the sudden onset of sleep or sleep attacks were reported in 8 of 387 (2%) patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets compared to 2 of 281 (1%) patients on placebo. In early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 36% of 223 patients treated with MIRAPEX ER, median dose 3.0 mg/day, compared to 15% of 103 patients on placebo. In advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 15% of 164 patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets, median dose 3 mg/day, compared to 16% of 178 patients on placebo.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials in Parkinson's disease, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was reported in 10 of 387 (3%) patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets compared to 3 of 281 (1%) patients on placebo. One patient of 387 on MIRAPEX ER tablets discontinued treatment due to hypotension. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of cross-sectional studies suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including MIRAPEX ER, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking MIRAPEX ER. A total of 1056 patients with Parkinson's disease who participated in two MIRAPEX ER placebo-controlled studies of up to 33 weeks duration were specifically asked at each visit about the occurrence of these symptoms. A total of 14 of 387 (4%) treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets, 12 of 388 (3%) treated with immediate-release pramipexole tablets, and 4 of 281 (1%) treated with placebo reported compulsive behaviors, including pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and/or compulsive buying. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In placebo-controlled clinical trials in Parkinson's disease, hallucinations (visual or auditory or mixed) were reported in 25 of 387 (6%) patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets compared to 5 of 281 (2%) patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations led to discontinuation of treatment in 5 of 387 (1%) patients on MIRAPEX ER tablets. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In placebo-controlled clinical trials in Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were reported in 15 of 162 (9%) patients >=65 years of age taking MIRAPEX ER tablets compared to 10 of 225 (4%) patients <65 years of age taking MIRAPEX ER tablets.

Patients with mild renal impairment (a creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min) require no reduction in daily dose. MIRAPEX ER tablets have not been studied in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) or on hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis In the clinical development program for immediate-release pramipexole tablets, a single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. Advise patients to contact a physician if they experience any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, as these may be symptoms of rhabdomyolysis. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared immediate-release pramipexole tablets and immediate-release ropinirole.

The potential significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the postmarketing experience with immediate-release pramipexole tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiologic studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning; advise patients to report symptoms (5.1) Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension: Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior: May occur; risk increases with age (5.4) Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by MIRAPEX (5.5) Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with pramipexole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack) such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day) for Parkinson's disease. In controlled clinical trials in RLS, patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets at doses of 0.25-0.75 mg once a day, the incidence of somnolence was 6% compared to an incidence of 3% for placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with MIRAPEX tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with MIRAPEX tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), MIRAPEX tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue MIRAPEX tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's disease patients and RLS patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. Also, clinical trials in patients with RLS did not incorporate orthostatic challenges with intensive blood pressure monitoring done in close temporal proximity to dosing. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including MIRAPEX, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with MIRAPEX. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking MIRAPEX. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving MIRAPEX tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received MIRAPEX tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving MIRAPEX tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. Postmarketing reports with medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, including MIRAPEX, indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with MIRAPEX or after starting or increasing the dose of MIRAPEX. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine agonists, including MIRAPEX, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of MIRAPEX [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. In the RLS clinical trials, one pramipexole-treated patient (of 889) reported hallucinations; this patient discontinued treatment and the symptoms resolved. 5.5 Dyskinesia MIRAPEX tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing MIRAPEX tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with MIRAPEX tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared MIRAPEX tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3.0 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs.

Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using MIRAPEX tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). Rebound and Augmentation in RLS Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in rebound: a worsening of symptoms following treatment cessation with greater intensity than described before starting treatment. In a 26 week placebo controlled clinical trial in patients with RLS, a worsening of symptoms scores (IRLS) beyond their untreated baseline levels was reported more frequently by patients suddenly withdrawn from MIRAPEX (up to 0.75 mg once daily) compared to the group assigned to placebo (10% vs. 2%, respectively). The worsening of RLS symptoms was considered generally mild. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. In a 26 week placebo controlled clinical trial in patients with RLS, augmentation was reported with greater frequency by patients treated with MIRAPEX (up to 0.75 mg once daily) compared to patients who received placebo (12% vs. 9%, respectively). The incidence of augmentation increased with increasing duration of exposure to MIRAPEX and to placebo. The frequency and severity of augmentation and/or rebound after longer-term use of MIRAPEX tablets and the appropriate management of these events have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials."$$

In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning; advise patients to report symptoms (5.1) Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension: Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior: May occur; risk increases with age (5.4) Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by pramipexole dihydrochloride (5.5) Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with pramipexole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack) such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day) for Parkinson's disease. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. Postmarketing reports with medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride or after starting or increasing the dose of pramipexole dihydrochloride. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis.

Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. Postmarketing reports with medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride or after starting or increasing the dose of pramipexole dihydrochloride. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49 year old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2 year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning; advise patients to report symptoms (5.1) Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension: Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior: May occur; risk increases with age (5.4) Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets (5.5) Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack) such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day) for Parkinson's disease. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets , that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo.

This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. 5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. Postmarketing reports with medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or after starting or increasing the dose of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine agonists, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3.0 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning. Advise patients to report symptoms (5.1) -Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) -Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) -Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior: May occur; risk increases with age. (5.4) -Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by PRAMIPEXOLE DIHYDROCHLORIDE tablets (5.5) -Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with pramipexole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs (sleep attack) such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day) for Parkinson's disease. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo.

Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk [see Patient Counseling Information (17.5) ]. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.4 Hallucinations In the three doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49 year old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2 year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in antiparkinsonian therapy. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$

Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg TID) for Parkinson's disease. Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.

Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets , that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Hallucinations In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations. Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3.0 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in antiparkinsonian therapy. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning. Advise patients to report symptoms to the prescriber. (5.1) Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) Hallucinations: May occur. Risk increases with age. (5.4) Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets (5.5) Renal Impairment: Requires dose reduction (2.2, 12.3) Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living Patients treated with pramipexole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg TID) for Parkinson's disease. Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.5) ]. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials.

Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. 5.5 Dyskinesia Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. 5.6 Renal Impairment Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution should be exercised when prescribing pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets to patients with renal impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis A single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49-year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. 5.8 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson's disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.2)]. 5.9 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported in association with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in antiparkinsonian therapy. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the post marketing experience with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets cannot be completely ruled out. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists)."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living: Sudden onset of sleep may occur without warning. Advise patients to report symptoms to the prescriber. (5.1) Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Monitor during dose escalation (5.2) Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience compulsive behaviors and other intense urges (5.3) Hallucinations: May occur. Risk increases with age. (5.4) Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets (5.5) Renal Impairment: Requires dose reduction (2.2, 12.3) Events reported with dopaminergic therapy: Include withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion, fibrotic complications, and melanoma (5.9) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living Patients treated with pramipexole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on pramipexole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events had been reported as late as one year after the initiation of treatment. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg TID) for Parkinson's disease. Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase pramipexole plasma levels (e.g., cimetidine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.), pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. If a decision is made to continue pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. While dose reduction reduces the degree of somnolence, there is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, Parkinson's disease patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk [see Patient Counseling Information (17.5)]. In clinical trials of pramipexole, however, and despite clear orthostatic effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramipexole tablets than among those assigned to placebo. This result, especially with the higher doses used in Parkinson's disease, is clearly unexpected in light of the previous experience with the risks of dopamine agonist therapy. While this finding could reflect a unique property of pramipexole, it might also be explained by the conditions of the study and the nature of the population enrolled in the clinical trials. Patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with active cardiovascular disease or significant orthostatic hypotension at baseline were excluded. 5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Hallucinations In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260)of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo.

"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Strides Pharma Inc at 1-877-244-9825 or go to www.stridesarco.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].

Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied. Table 5 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event@ Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Advanced Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) @ Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

General Adverse Events: Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Parkinso's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa.

during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritis, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse events (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1).

Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Parkinso's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. In the three double-blind, Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-ControlledTrials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) * Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). : Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied. Table 5 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-EventPatients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1) Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will, in general, present adverse-reaction data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse reactions. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]) and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse- reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa.

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo] and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse- reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: cardiac failure, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5% and greater than placebo): -Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1) -Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: -Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. -Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. -Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. -Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. -Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. -Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse reactions. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common observed adverse reactions (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa.

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.8% on placebo]; and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.1% on placebo]).

The overall safety assessment focuses on the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, in which 575 patients with RLS were treated with MIRAPEX tablets for up to 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions with MIRAPEX tablets in the treatment of RLS (observed in >5% of pramipexole-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that observed in placebo-treated patients) were nausea and somnolence. Occurrences of nausea and somnolence in clinical trials were generally mild and transient. Approximately 7% of 575 patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets during the double-blind periods of three placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 5% of 223 patients who received placebo. The adverse reaction most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment was nausea (1%). Table 6 lists reactions that occurred in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in RLS patients that were reported by >=2% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group.

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will, in general, present adverse-reaction data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse reactions. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]) and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa.

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.8% on placebo]) and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse reactions related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: cardiac failure, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), skin reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria), syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common observed adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo] and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: cardiac failure, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1).

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will, in general, present adverse-reaction data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common observed adverse reaction (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa.

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common observed adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo] and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]).

Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo.

The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa.

During the premarketing development of MIRAPEX ER tablets, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets, placebo, or immediate-release pramipexole tablets. In addition, a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial was conducted in 156 early Parkinson's disease patients (Hoehn & Yahr Stages I-III) to assess overnight switching of immediate-release pramipexole tablets to MIRAPEX ER tablets. In this latter study, concomitant treatment with stable doses of levodopa, monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (MAOB-I) drugs, anticholinergics, or amantadine, individually or in combination, was allowed. In a third trial, advanced Parkinson's disease patients received MIRAPEX ER tablets, placebo, or immediate-release pramipexole tablets as adjunctive therapy to levodopa. Early Parkinson's Disease The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and more frequent than placebo) after 33 weeks of treatment with MIRAPEX ER tablets in the trial of early Parkinson's disease patients were somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, fatigue, hallucinations, dry mouth, muscle spasms, and peripheral edema. Twenty four of 223 (11%) patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets for 33 weeks discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 4 of 103 (4%) patients who received placebo and approximately 20 of 213 (9%) patients who received immediate-release pramipexole tablets. The adverse reaction most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment with MIRAPEX ER tablets was nausea (2%). Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% with MIRAPEX ER and were more frequent than with placebo during 33 weeks of treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in early Parkinson's disease. In this study, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa; however, levodopa was permitted as rescue medication.

Adverse reactions can initially occur in either the titration or maintenance phase. Some adverse reactions developed in MIRAPEX ER-treated patients during the titration phase and persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase (i.e., MIRAPEX ER % - placebo % = treatment difference >=2%); persistent adverse reactions were somnolence, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and dry mouth. A double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial evaluated the tolerability of an overnight switch from immediate-release pramipexole tablets to MIRAPEX ER tablets at the same daily dose in 156 early Parkinson's disease patients with or without levodopa. One of 104 patients switched from immediate-release pramipexole tablets to MIRAPEX ER tablets discontinued due to adverse reactions (vertigo and nausea). Advanced Parkinson's Disease The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and greater frequency than in placebo) during 18 weeks of treatment with MIRAPEX ER tablets in the trial of advanced Parkinson's disease patients with concomitant levodopa were dyskinesia, nausea, constipation, hallucinations, headache, and anorexia. Eight of 164 (5%) patients treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets for 18 weeks discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 7 of 178 (4%) patients who received placebo and 8 of 175 (5%) patients who received immediate-release pramipexole tablets. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment with MIRAPEX ER tablets were nausea (1%) and hallucination (1%). Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% with MIRAPEX ER and were more frequent than with placebo during 18 weeks of treatment in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with MIRAPEX ER tablets. In this study, MIRAPEX ER tablets, immediate-release pramipexole tablets, or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

Laboratory Tests During the development of MIRAPEX ER tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Other adverse reactions observed during clinical trials of MIRAPEX immediate-release or MIRAPEX ER in early and advanced Parkinson's disease Other adverse reactions in clinical studies involving MIRAPEX immediate-release or MIRAPEX ER tablets include abnormal dreams, akathisia, amnesia, decreased libido, decreased weight, dyspnea, pneumonia, and vision abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIRAPEX immediate-release or MIRAPEX ER tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: cardiac failure, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), skin reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria), syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$

During the premarketing development of pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, placebo, or immediate-release pramipexole tablets. In addition, a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial was conducted in 156 early Parkinson's disease patients (Hoehn & Yahr Stages I-III) to assess overnight switching of immediate-release pramipexole tablets to extended-release pramipexole tablets. In this latter study, concomitant treatment with stable doses of levodopa, monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (MAOB-I) drugs, anticholinergics, or amantadine, individually or in combination, was allowed. In a third trial, advanced Parkinson's disease patients received pramipexole extended-release tablets, placebo, or immediate-release pramipexole tablets as adjunctive therapy to levodopa. Early Parkinson's Disease The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and more frequent than placebo) after 33 weeks of treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets in the trial of early Parkinson's disease patients were somnolence, nausea, constipation, dizziness, fatigue, hallucinations, dry mouth, muscle spasms, and peripheral edema. Twenty four of 223 (11%) patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for 33 weeks discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 4 of 103 (4%) patients who received placebo and approximately 20 of 213 (9%) patients who received immediate-release pramipexole tablets. The adverse reaction most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets was nausea (2%). Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release and were more frequent than with placebo during 33 weeks of treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in early Parkinson's disease. In this study, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa; however, levodopa was permitted as rescue medication. Adverse events were usually mild (38%) or moderate (41%) in intensity.

Some adverse reactions developed in pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release-treated patients during the titration phase and persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase (i.e., pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release % - placebo % = treatment difference >=2%); persistent adverse reactions were somnolence, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and dry mouth. A double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial evaluated the tolerability of an overnight switch from immediate-release pramipexole tablets to extended-release pramipexole tablets at the same daily dose in 156 early Parkinson's disease patients with or without levodopa. One of 104 patients switched from immediate-release pramipexole tablets to extended-release pramipexole tablets discontinued due to adverse events (vertigo and nausea). Advanced Parkinson's Disease The most common adverse reactions (>=5% and greater frequency than in placebo) during 18 weeks of treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets in the trial of advanced Parkinson's disease patients with concomitant levodopa were dyskinesia, nausea, constipation, hallucinations, headache, and anorexia. Eight of 164 (5%) patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets for 18 weeks discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared to 7 of 178 (4%) patients who received placebo and 8 of 175 (5%) patients who received immediate-release pramipexole tablets. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets were nausea (1%) and hallucination (1%). Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release and were more frequent than with placebo during 18 weeks of treatment in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets. In this study, pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, immediate-release pramipexole tablets, or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

Adverse reactions can initially occur in either the titration or maintenance phase. Some adverse reactions developed in pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release-treated patients during the titration phase and persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase (i.e., pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release % - placebo % = treatment difference >=2%); persistent adverse reactions were dyskinesia and insomnia. Laboratory Testing During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Other adverse reactions observed during clinical trials ofpramipexole dihydrochloride immediate-release tablets orpramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets inearly and advanced Parkinson's disease Other adverse reactions in clinical studies involving pramipexole dihydrochloride immediate-release tablets or pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets include abnormal dreams, akathisia, amnesia, decreased libido, decreased weight, dyspnea, pneumonia, and vision abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identifiedduring post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochlorideimmediate-release tablets or pramipexole dihydrochlorideextended-release tablets, primarily in Parkinson's diseasepatients.

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions this section will, in general, present adverse reaction data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse reactions. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Table 4 Adverse-Reactions in Pooled Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride in Early Parkinson's Disease Body System/Adverse Reaction Pramipexole Dihydrochloride (N=388) % Placebo (N=235) % Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following reactions increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these reactions was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most common adverse reactions (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The reactions most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse reaction Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa.

No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse reactions related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets.

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-EventPatients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]).

General Adverse Events: Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate hormone secretion (SIADH), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Most common adverse events (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1).

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) Body System/ Adverse Event Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets (N=388) % Placebo (N=235) % Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category. Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritus, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

General Adverse Events: Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care.

Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

General Adverse Events: Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology.

during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: -Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. -Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. -Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. -Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. -Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. -Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. -Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. -Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Most common adverse events (incidence >5% and greater than placebo): - Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations (6.1). - Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency (6.1).

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease: Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) Body System/ Adverse Event Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets (N=388) % Placebo (N=235) % Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category. Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritus, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease: Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

General Adverse Events: Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below.

during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients.Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA terminology: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, , compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), skin reactions (including erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria), syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: -Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. -Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. -Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. -Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. -Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. -Retinal Pathology [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. -Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Parkinson's disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Doubleblind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >= 1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group) Body System/ Adverse Event Pramipexole Dihydrochloride (N=388) % Placebo (N=235) % Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category. Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritus, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the doubleblind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian: therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Laboratory Tests During the development of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, no systematic abnormalities on routine laboratory testing were noted. Therefore, no specific guidance is offered regarding routine monitoring; the practitioner retains responsibility for determining how best to monitor the patient in his or her care. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

"ADVERSE EVENTS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with MIRAPEX tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with MIRAPEX tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on Mirapex(R) (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with MIRAPEX tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received Mirapex(R) (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]).

In these studies, MIRAPEX tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies.

Restless Legs Syndrome MIRAPEX tablets for treatment of RLS have been evaluated for safety in 889 patients, including 427 treated for over six months and 75 for over one year. The overall safety assessment focuses on the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, in which 575 patients with RLS were treated with MIRAPEX tablets for up to 12 weeks. The most commonly observed adverse events with MIRAPEX tablets in the treatment of RLS (observed in > 5% of pramipexole-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that observed in placebo-treated patients) were nausea and somnolence. Occurrences of nausea and somnolence in clinical trials were generally mild and transient. Approximately 7% of 575 patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets during the double-blind periods of three placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to 5% of 223 patients who received placebo. The adverse event most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment was nausea (1%). Table 5 lists treatment-emergent events that occurred in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in RLS patients that were reported by >= 2% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.

Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients, nausea and fatigue, both generally transient, were more frequently reported by female than male RLS patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials MIRAPEX tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients and to 889 RLS patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2509 individuals exposed to MIRAPEX tablets are listed below.

while engaged in activities of daily living, including operation of a motor vehicle which sometimes resulted in accidents (see bolded WARNING ). Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIRAPEX tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase."$$
"ADVERSE EVENTS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with MIRAPEX tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with MIRAPEX tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on Mirapex(R) (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with MIRAPEX tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received Mirapex(R) (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on MIRAPEX tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, MIRAPEX tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

Restless Legs Syndrome MIRAPEX tablets for treatment of RLS have been evaluated for safety in 889 patients, including 427 treated for over six months and 75 for over one year. The overall safety assessment focuses on the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, in which 575 patients with RLS were treated with MIRAPEX tablets for up to 12 weeks. The most commonly observed adverse events with MIRAPEX tablets in the treatment of RLS (observed in > 5% of pramipexole-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that observed in placebo-treated patients) were nausea and somnolence. Occurrences of nausea and somnolence in clinical trials were generally mild and transient. Approximately 7% of 575 patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets during the double-blind periods of three placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared to 5% of 223 patients who received placebo. The adverse event most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment was nausea (1%). Table 5 lists treatment-emergent events that occurred in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in RLS patients that were reported by >= 2% of patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied.

Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients, nausea and fatigue, both generally transient, were more frequently reported by female than male RLS patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials MIRAPEX tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients and to 889 RLS patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below.

while engaged in activities of daily living, including operation of a motor vehicle which sometimes resulted in accidents (see bolded WARNING ). Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIRAPEX tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, cardiac failure, compulsive shopping, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, pruritus, syncope, vomiting, and weight increase. In a pharmacoepidemiological study, pramipexole use was associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use of pramipexole."$$
"ADVERSE EVENTS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent Than in the Placebo Group) Body System/Adverse Event Pramipexole dihydrochloride Placebo N=388 N=235 Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & NutritionalSystem Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 *Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category. Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritis, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]).

In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below.

Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, syncope, and weight increase."$$
"ADVERSE EVENTS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event* Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent than in the Placebo Group). Body System/ Adverse Event Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets N=388 Placebo N=235 * Patients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 1620 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's DiseaseIn the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency.

Patients received concomitant levodopa. Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were nausea, pain, infection, headache, depression, tremor, hypokinesia, anorexia, back pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, ataxia, flu syndrome, sinusitis, diarrhea, myalgia, abdominal pain, anxiety, rash, paresthesia, hypertension, increased saliva, tooth disorder, apathy, hypotension, sweating, vasodilation, vomiting, increased cough, nervousness, pruritus, hypesthesia, neck pain, syncope, arthralgia, dysphagia, palpitations, pharyngitis, vertigo, leg cramps, conjunctivitis, and lacrimation disorders. General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and RaceAmong the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were noncaucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Phase 2 and 3 Clinical TrialsPramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1,620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2,509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, syncope, and weight increase."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse-Event Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >=1% of Patients Treated With Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent Than in the Placebo Group) Body System/Adverse Event Pramipexole dihydrochloride N=388 Placebo N=235 Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritis, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies.

The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse-EventPatients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (>5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >=1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-events incidence rate in the population studied.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. Although no gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were noncaucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1,620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2,509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

activities of daily living, including operation of a motor vehicle which sometimes resulted in accidents (see bolded WARNING). Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, syncope, and weight increase."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse-EventPatients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category.

In a fixed dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs. 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson' disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were non-Caucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have been administered to 1,620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2,509 individuals exposed to pramipexole are listed below.

Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, primarily in Parkinson's disease patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. Similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using the MedDRA dictionary: abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams, accidents (including fall), blackouts, fatigue, hallucinations (all kinds), headache, hypotension (including postural hypotension), increased eating (including binge eating, compulsive eating, and hyperphagia), libido disorders (including increased and decreased libido, and hypersexuality), pathological gambling, syncope, and weight increase."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of pramipexole, patients with either early or advanced Parkinson's disease were enrolled in clinical trials. Apart from the severity and duration of their disease, the two populations differed in their use of concomitant levodopa therapy. Patients with early disease did not receive concomitant levodopa therapy during treatment with pramipexole; those with advanced Parkinson's disease all received concomitant levodopa treatment. Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse events, this section will, in general, present adverse-event data for these two populations separately. Because the controlled trials performed during premarketing development all used a titration design, with a resultant confounding of time and dose, it was impossible to adequately evaluate the effects of dose on the incidence of adverse events. Early Parkinson's Disease In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, asthenia, and hallucinations. Approximately 12% of 388 patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 11% of 235 patients who received placebo. The adverse events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [3.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dizziness [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1% on placebo]; somnolence [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.6% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 6.4% on placebo]; headache and confusion [1.3% and 1%, respectively, on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0% on placebo]); and gastrointestinal system (nausea [2.1% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Early Parkinson's Disease Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in early Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, patients did not receive concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. However, the cited figures do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse-event incidence rate in the population studied. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse-EventPatients may have reported multiple adverse experiences during the study or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than one category. Incidence in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Early Parkinson's Disease (Events >= 1% of Patients Treated with Pramipexole Dihydrochloride Tablets and Numerically More Frequent Than in the Placebo Group) Body System/Adverse Event Pramipexole Dihydrochloride N=388 Placebo N=235 Body as a Whole Asthenia 14 12 General edema 5 3 Malaise 2 1 Reaction unevaluable 2 1 Fever 1 0 Digestive System Nausea 28 18 Constipation 14 6 Anorexia 4 2 Dysphagia 2 0 Metabolic & Nutritional System Peripheral edema 5 4 Decreased weight 2 0 Nervous System Dizziness 25 24 Somnolence 22 9 Insomnia 17 12 Hallucinations 9 3 Confusion 4 1 Amnesia 4 2 Hypesthesia 3 1 Dystonia 2 1 Akathisia 2 0 Thinking abnormalities 2 0 Decreased libido 1 0 Myoclonus 1 0 Special Senses Vision abnormalities 3 0 Urogenital System Impotence 2 1 Other events reported by 1% or more of patients with early Parkinson's disease and treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets but reported equally or more frequently in the placebo group were infection, accidental injury, headache, pain, tremor, back pain, syncope, postural hypotension, hypertonia, depression, abdominal pain, anxiety, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, rash, ataxia, dry mouth, extrapyramidal syndrome, leg cramps, twitching, pharyngitis, sinusitis, sweating, rhinitis, urinary tract infection, vasodilation, flu syndrome, increased saliva, tooth disease, dyspnea, increased cough, gait abnormalities, urinary frequency, vomiting, allergic reaction, hypertension, pruritis, hypokinesia, increased creatine PK, nervousness, dream abnormalities, chest pain, neck pain, paresthesia, tachycardia, vertigo, voice alteration, conjunctivitis, paralysis, accommodation abnormalities, tinnitus, diplopia, and taste perversions. In a fixed-dose study in early Parkinson's disease, occurrence of the following events increased in frequency as the dose increased over the range from 1.5 mg/day to 6 mg/day: postural hypotension, nausea, constipation, somnolence, and amnesia. The frequency of these events was generally 2-fold greater than placebo for pramipexole doses greater than 3 mg/day. The incidence of somnolence with pramipexole at a dose of 1.5 mg/day was comparable to that reported for placebo. Advanced Parkinson's Disease In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse events (> 5%) that were numerically more frequent in the group treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa were postural (orthostatic) hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urinary frequency. Approximately 12% of 260 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 16% of 264 patients who received placebo and concomitant levodopa. The events most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment were related to the nervous system (hallucinations [2.7% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.4% on placebo]; dyskinesia [1.9% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 0.8% on placebo]; extrapyramidal syndrome [1.5% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 4.9% on placebo]; dizziness [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.5% on placebo]; confusion [1.2% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 2.3% on placebo]); and cardiovascular system (postural [orthostatic] hypotension [2.3% on pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets vs 1.1% on placebo]). Adverse-Event Incidence in Controlled Clinical Studies in Advanced Parkinson's Disease Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in advanced Parkinson's disease that were reported by >= 1% of patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group. In these studies, pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets or placebo was administered to patients who were also receiving concomitant levodopa. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical studies.

General Adverse Events; Relationship to Age, Gender, and Race Among the treatment-emergent adverse events in patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, hallucination appeared to exhibit a positive relationship to age in patients with Parkinson's disease. No gender-related differences were observed in Parkinson's disease patients. Less than 4% of patients enrolled were noncaucasian, therefore, an evaluation of adverse events related to race is not possible. Other Adverse Events Observed During Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials Pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets had been administered to 1,620 Parkinson's disease patients in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing; similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using MedDRA dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. Adverse events which are not listed above but occurred on at least two occasions (one occasion if the event was serious) in the 2,509 individuals exposed to pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets are listed below.

"Drug Interactions"$$
"Drug Interactions Carbidopa/levodopa: Carbidopa/levodopa did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole in healthy volunteers (N=10). Pramipexole did not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination of carbidopa/levodopa, although it caused an increase in levodopa Cmax by about 40% and a decrease in Tmax from 2.5 to 0.5 hours. Selegiline: In healthy volunteers (N=11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole. Amantadine: Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that amantadine may slightly decrease the oral clearance of pramipexole. Cimetidine: Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N=12). Probenecid: Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the anionic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N=12). Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole. CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro. Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 \\302\\265M, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the clinical dose of 4.5 mg/day (1.5 mg TID). Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of Mirapex(R) (pramipexole dihydrochloride) tablets."$$

Pramipexole did not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination of carbidopa/levodopa, although it caused an increase in levodopa Cmax by about 40% and a decrease in Tmax from 2.5 to 0.5 hours. Selegiline In healthy volunteers (N=11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole. Amantadine Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that amantadine may slightly decrease the oral clearance of pramipexole. Cimetidine Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N=12). Probenecid Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the anionic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N=12)."$$

Probenecid Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the anionic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N=12). Other Drugs Eliminated via Renal Secretion Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole. CYP Interactions Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro. Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 \\302\\265M, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the clinical dose of 4.5 mg/day (1.5 mg TID).
