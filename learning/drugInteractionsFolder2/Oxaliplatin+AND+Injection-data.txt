"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic Reactions: Monitor for development of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. (5.1) Neuropathy: Reduce the dose or discontinue ELOXATIN if necessary. (5.2) Severe Neutropenia: Delay ELOXATIN until neutrophils are >=1.5 \\303\\227 109/L. Withhold ELOXATIN for sepsis. (5.3) Pulmonary Toxicity: May need to discontinue ELOXATIN until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis are excluded. (5.4) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. (5.5) Cardiovascular Toxicity: Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating ELOXATIN. (5.6) Rhabdomyolysis: Discontinue ELOXATIN if rhabdomyolysis occurs. (5.7) Pregnancy. Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.8, 8.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to ELOXATIN has been observed in 2-3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy ELOXATIN is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing.The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received ELOXATIN with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the ELOXATIN with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1-2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of ELOXATIN because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving ELOXATIN with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of ELOXATIN. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the ELOXATIN combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41-44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with ELOXATIN in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with ELOXATIN, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Delay ELOXATIN until neutrophils are >= 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L. Withhold ELOXATIN for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce ELOXATIN after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity ELOXATIN has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the ELOXATIN plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the ELOXATIN combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the ELOXATIN plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, ELOXATIN should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the ELOXATIN combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following ELOXATIN administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating ELOXATIN and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid ELOXATIN in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with ELOXATIN. Discontinue ELOXATIN if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D ELOXATIN may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELOXATIN in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with ELOXATIN. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each ELOXATIN cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received ELOXATIN plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving ELOXATIN plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring."$$

In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin for injection has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin for injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin for injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin for injection should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. 5.5 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin for injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin for injection in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin for injection. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.6 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin for injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. There have been reports while on study and from postmarketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin for injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin for injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic Reactions: Monitor for development of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. (5.1) Neuropathy: Reduce the dose or discontinue Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP if necessary. (5.2) Pulmonary Toxicity: May need to discontinue Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis are excluded. (5.3) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. (5.4) Pregnancy. Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.5, 8.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3).

Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41-44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Delay oxaliplatin until neutrophils are >= 1.5 \\303\\227 109/L. Withhold oxaliplatin for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce oxaliplatin after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following oxaliplatin administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid oxaliplatin in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin. Discontinue oxaliplatin if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Allergic Reactions: Monitor for development of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. ( 5.1 ) - Neuropathy: Reduce the dose or discontinue oxaliplatin if necessary. ( 5.2 ) - Severe Neutropenia: Delay oxaliplatin until neutrophils are >=1.5 x 109/L. Withhold oxaliplatin for sepsis. (5.3) - Pulmonary Toxicity: May need to discontinue oxaliplatin until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis are excluded. ( 5.4 ) - Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. (5.5) - Cardiovascular Toxicity: Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin. (5.6) - Rhabdomyolysis: Discontinue oxaliplatin if rhabdomyolysis occurs. (5.7) - Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.8, 8.1 ) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to oxaliplatin has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias , dysesthesias, hypoesthesias , but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of oxaliplatin. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the oxaliplatin combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41-44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin , including fatal outcomes [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Delay oxaliplatin until neutrophils are >= 1.5 x 109/L. Withhold oxaliplatin for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce oxaliplatin after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2 )]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see CLINICAL TRIALS EXPERIENCE (6.1)]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following oxaliplatin administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias , drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics , and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid oxaliplatin in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin. Discontinue oxaliplatin if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur. [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin cycle [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to oxaliplatin has been observed in 2% to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin is associated with two types of neuropathy An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1% to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (> 14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of oxaliplatin. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the oxaliplatin combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41 to 44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Delay oxaliplatin until neutrophils are >= 1.5 x 109/L. Withhold oxaliplatin for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce oxaliplatin after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (< 1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and < 1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following oxaliplatin administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid oxaliplatin in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin. Discontinue oxaliplatin if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring."$$

The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications(4)]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin Injection is associated with two types of neuropathy An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the Oxaliplatin Injection with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1-2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of Oxaliplatin Injection. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the Oxaliplatin Injection combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin Injection has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the Oxaliplatin Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, Oxaliplatin Injection should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience(6.1) ]. 5.5 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Oxaliplatin Injection in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Oxaliplatin Injection. [see Use in Specific Populations(8.1)]. 5.6 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each Oxaliplatin Injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration(2)]. There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic Reactions: Monitor for development of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. (5.1) Neuropathy: Reduce the dose or discontinue oxaliplatin injection if necessary. (5.2) Severe Neutropenia: Delay oxaliplatin injection until neutrophils are >=1.5 x 109/L.Withhold oxaliplatin injection for sepsis. (5.3) Pulmonary Toxicity: May need to discontinue oxaliplatin injection until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis are excluded. (5.4) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. (5.5) Cardiovascular Toxicity: Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin injection. (5.6) Rhabdomyolysis: Discontinue oxaliplatin injection if rhabdomyolysis occurs. (5.7) Pregnancy. Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.8, 8.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to oxaliplatin injection has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin injection is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin injection because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (>14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of oxaliplatin injection. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the oxaliplatin injection combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3).

In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2 (see below). Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (< 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging. 5.3 Severe Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41-44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin injection in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin injection, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Delay oxaliplatin injection until neutrophils are >= 1.5 x 109/L. Withhold oxaliplatin injection for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce oxaliplatin injection after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin injection has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (<1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and <1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin injection should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm than in the control arm.

Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following oxaliplatin injection administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin injection and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid oxaliplatin injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin injection. Discontinue oxaliplatin injection if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin injection in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin injection. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin injection cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities and hepatotoxicities can occur [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin for Injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin for Injection and Infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin for Injection in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin for Injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin for Injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin for Injection alone, and 7% with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin for Injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin for Injection to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin for Injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin for Injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin for Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin for Injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: - Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] - Neuropathy [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] - Pulmonary Toxicities [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] - Hepatotoxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4).] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin Injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection and Infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin Injection in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin Injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin Injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin Injection alone, and 7% with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin Injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin Injection to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin Injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin Injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Hearing and vestibular system disorders: Deafness Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Onco Therapies Limited at 1-877-244-9825 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities and hepatotoxicities can occur [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin for Injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin for Injection and Infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin for Injection in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin for Injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin for Injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin for Injection alone, and 7% with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin for Injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin for Injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin for Injection to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin for Injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin for Injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin for Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin for Injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities and hepatotoxicities can occur [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin Injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin Injection in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin Injection combination and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies(14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin Injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin Injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies(14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies(14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5- fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin Injection is administered in combination with 5- fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin Injection alone, and 7% with 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies(14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin Injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin Injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection plus infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin Injection to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin Injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin Injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin Injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions(5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Serious adverse reactions including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicities and hepatotoxicities can occur [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin for injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin for Injection and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin for injection in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin for injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin for injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin for injection is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin for injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin for injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin for injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin for injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin for injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin for injection is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin for injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin for injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin for injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin for injection is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin for injection alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin for injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin for injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin for injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin for injection to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin for injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin for injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin for injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from postmarketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin for injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin for injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin for injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin for injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of oxaliplatin for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress.

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Neuropathy [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Toxicities [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hepatotoxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: - Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] - Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .] - Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) .] - Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) .] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Vigilance & Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Stevens - Johnson syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5\\302\\255fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: Laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Neuropathy [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Toxicities [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hepatotoxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Neuropathy [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] Pulmonary Toxicities [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] Hepatotoxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with Stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with Stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy With Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5- Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in Patients With Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with Stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n = 6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n = 3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI Grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

Table 4 - Adverse Reactions Reported in Patients With Colon Cancer Receiving Adjuvant Treatment (>= 5% of All Patients, but With < 1% NCI Grade 3/4 Events) Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV N = 1108 5-FU/LV N = 1111 Adverse Reaction (WHO/Pref) All Grades (%) All Grades (%) Allergy/Immunology Rhinitis 6 8 Constitutional Symptoms/Pain/Ocular/Visual Epistaxis 16 12 Weight Increase 10 10 Conjunctivitis 9 15 Headache 7 5 Dyspnea 5 3 Pain 5 5 Lacrimation Abnormal 4 12 Dermatology/Skin Alopecia 30 28 Gastrointestinal Constipation 22 19 Taste Perversion 12 8 Dyspepsia 8 5 Metabolic Phosphate Alkaline Increased 42 20 Neurology Sensory Disturbance 8 1 Although specific events can vary, the overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in men and women and in patients < 65 and >= 65 years. However, the following Grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >= 65 years old, the incidence of Grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >= 2% and < 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for Grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >= 2% and < 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for Grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3% to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant Grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from postmarketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5% to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >= 5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6% and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole angioedema, anaphylactic shock Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES).

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: -Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. -Neuropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. -Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. -Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. -Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. -Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [ see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin combination therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red blood cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: -Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. -Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. -Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. -Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. -Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. -Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [ see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >= 65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >= 2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the Oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the Oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the Oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with Oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with Oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >= 2% and <5% of the patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with Oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of Oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the Oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to Oxaliplatin combination therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >= 5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red blood cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: -Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1).] -Neuropathy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2).] -Severe Neutropenia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3).] -Pulmonary Toxicities [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4).] -Hepatotoxicity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5).] -Cardiovascular Toxicities [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6).] -Rhabdomyolysis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc., at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)] The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES).

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) .] Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) .] Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) .] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).] Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6).] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with ELOXATIN. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with ELOXATIN and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with ELOXATIN in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the ELOXATIN combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving ELOXATIN and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and ELOXATIN are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When ELOXATIN is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the ELOXATIN combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the ELOXATIN combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the ELOXATIN combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the ELOXATIN and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the ELOXATIN and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the ELOXATIN combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the ELOXATIN combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the ELOXATIN combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and ELOXATIN are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When ELOXATIN is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with ELOXATIN plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with ELOXATIN plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and ELOXATIN are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When ELOXATIN is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with ELOXATIN alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): anxiety, myalgia, erythematous rash, increased sweating, conjunctivitis, weight decrease, dry mouth, rectal hemorrhage, depression, ataxia, ascites, hemorrhoids, muscle weakness, nervousness, tachycardia, abnormal micturition frequency, dry skin, pruritus, hemoptysis, purpura, vaginal hemorrhage, melena, somnolence, pneumonia, proctitis, involuntary muscle contractions, intestinal obstruction, gingivitis, tenesmus, hot flashes, enlarged abdomen, urinary incontinence. Hematologic Changes The following tables list the hematologic changes occurring in >=5% of patients, based on laboratory values and NCI grade, with the exception of those events occurring in adjuvant patients and anemia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively, which are based on AE reporting and NCI grade alone.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the ELOXATIN combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus ELOXATIN arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of ELOXATIN plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of ELOXATIN to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of ELOXATIN. Dermatologic ELOXATIN did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the ELOXATIN plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received ELOXATIN plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving ELOXATIN plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to ELOXATIN combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the ELOXATIN and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ELOXATIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4).] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).] Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6).] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): anxiety, myalgia, erythematous rash, increased sweating, conjunctivitis, weight decrease, dry mouth, rectal hemorrhage, depression, ataxia, ascites, hemorrhoids, muscle weakness, nervousness, tachycardia, abnormal micturition frequency, dry skin, pruritus, hemoptysis, purpura, vaginal hemorrhage, melena, somnolence, pneumonia, proctitis, involuntary muscle contractions, intestinal obstruction, gingivitis, tenesmus, hot flashes, enlarged abdomen, urinary incontinence. Hematologic Changes The following tables list the hematologic changes occurring in >=5% of patients, based on laboratory values and NCI grade, with the exception of those events occurring in adjuvant patients and anemia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively, which are based on AE reporting and NCI grade alone.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3-5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5-10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: - Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] - Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] - Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] - Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4).] - Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).] - Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6).] - Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin injection in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin injection is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >=65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin injection is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >=2% and <5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin injection is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin injection alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >=5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >=1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin injection combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin injection arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin injection to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin injection. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin injection did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from postmarketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5 to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin injection combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >=5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: -Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] -Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] -Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] -Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4).] -Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).] -Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6).] -Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7).] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients >= 65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in >= 2% and < 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing. The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were treated in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >= 2% and < 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): metabolic, pneumonitis, catheter infection, vertigo, prothrombin time, pulmonary, rectal bleeding, dysuria, nail changes, chest pain, rectal pain, syncope, hypertension, hypoxia, unknown infection, bone pain, pigmentation changes, and urticaria. Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients (about 150 receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study, regardless of causality, was 5% with the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 8% with oxaliplatin alone, and 7% with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment, 3 may have been treatment related, associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [see Clinical Studies (14)] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences >= 5% and for grade 3/4 events with incidences >= 1%. This table does not include hematologic and blood chemistry abnormalities; these are shown separately below.

The following additional adverse reactions, at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important, were reported in >= 2% and < 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): anxiety, myalgia, erythematous rash, increased sweating, conjunctivitis, weight decrease, dry mouth, rectal hemorrhage, depression, ataxia, ascites, hemorrhoids, muscle weakness, nervousness, tachycardia, abnormal micturition frequency, dry skin, pruritus, hemoptysis, purpura, vaginal hemorrhage, melena, somnolence, pneumonia, proctitis, involuntary muscle contractions, intestinal obstruction, gingivitis, tenesmus, hot flashes, enlarged abdomen, urinary incontinence. Hematologic Changes The following tables list the hematologic changes occurring in >= 5% of patients, based on laboratory values and NCI grade, with the exception of those events occurring in adjuvant patients and anemia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively, which are based on AE reporting and NCI grade alone. Table 9 - Adverse Hematologic Reactions in Patients with Colon Cancer Receiving Adjuvant Therapy (>= 5% of patients) Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV (N = 1108) 5-FU/LV (N = 1111) Hematology Parameter All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) Anemia 76 1 67 < 1 Neutropenia 79 41 40 5 Thrombocytopenia 77 2 19 < 1 Table 10 - Adverse Hematologic Reactions in Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer (>= 5% of patients) Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV N = 259 irinotecan + 5-FU/LV N = 256 Oxaliplatin + irinotecan N = 258 Hematology Parameter All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) Anemia 27 3 28 4 25 3 Leukopenia 85 20 84 23 76 24 Neutropenia 81 53 77 44 71 36 Thrombocytopenia 71 5 26 2 44 4 Table 11 - Adverse Hematologic Reactions in Previously Treated Patients (>= 5% of patients) 5-FU/LV (N = 142) Oxaliplatin (N = 153) Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV (N = 150) Hematology Parameter All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3/4 (%) Anemia 68 2 64 1 81 2 Leukopenia 34 1 13 0 76 19 Neutropenia 25 5 7 0 73 44 Thrombocytopenia 20 0 30 3 64 4 Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding Thrombocytopenia was frequently reported with the combination of oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the oxaliplatin combination arm compared to the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. These events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis. In the adjuvant trial, two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages. The incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 2% in adjuvant patients with colon cancer. In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was 3% to 5%, and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin control groups. Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0.2% of adjuvant patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In the previously untreated patients, the incidence of epistaxis was 10% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, and 2% and 1%, respectively, in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or irinotecan plus oxaliplatin arms. Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29% and 12% of adjuvant patients with colon cancer, respectively. In the adjuvant trial, 3 patients died from sepsis/neutropenic sepsis. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35% and 18% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27% and 17% of previously treated patients, respectively. In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia (0.7%) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3/4 neutropenia (1.1%) was 1.8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15% (3% of cycles) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 4% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Additionally, in this same population, infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 8% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 6% (less than 1% of cycles) in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (see table). In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). In previously treated patients receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis/stomatitis increased compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin controls (see table). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the previously untreated and previously treated patients appears to be similar across cycles. Premedication with antiemetics, including 5-HT3 blockers, is recommended. Diarrhea and mucositis may be exacerbated by the addition of oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and should be managed with appropriate supportive care. Since cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms, ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin. Dermatologic Oxaliplatin did not increase the incidence of alopecia compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. No complete alopecia was reported. The incidence of Grade 3/4 skin disorders was 2% in both the oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arms in the adjuvant colon cancer patients. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 2% in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 7% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. The incidence of hand-foot syndrome in previously treated patients was 13% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm and 11% in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Intravenous Site Reactions Extravasation, in some cases including necrosis, has been reported. Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, has been reported. Anticoagulation and Hemorrhage There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. Renal About 5% to 10% of patients in all groups had some degree of elevation of serum creatinine. The incidence of Grade 3/4 elevations in serum creatinine in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 1% in the previously treated patients. Serum creatinine measurements were not reported in the adjuvant trial. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity (defined as elevation of liver enzymes) appears to be related to oxaliplatin combination therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. The following tables list the clinical chemistry changes associated with hepatic toxicity occurring in >= 5% of patients, based on adverse reactions reported and NCI CTC grade for adjuvant patients and patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, laboratory values and NCI CTC grade for previously treated patients.

The incidence was 6 and 9% of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer and previously treated patients in the oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular disorders: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes Central and peripheral nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion, Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES). Hearing and vestibular system disorders: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion reactions/hypersensitivity: laryngospasm Liver and Gastrointestinal system disorders: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis; ileus; intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis; veno-occlusive disease of liver also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes. Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Red Blood Cell disorders: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal disorders: Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure. Respiratory system disorders: pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) Vision disorders: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation)"$$

No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin Injection and 5- fluorouracil/leucovorin has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks. Increases of 5- fluorouracil plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin Injection dosed every 3 weeks.
