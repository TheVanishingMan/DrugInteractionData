"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Fatal splenic rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. (5.1) - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue ZARXIO in patients with ARDS. (5.2) - Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue ZARXIO in patients with serious allergic reactions. (5.3) - Fatal sickle cell crises: Have occurred. (5.4) - Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of ZARXIO if causality is likely. (5.5) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue ZARXIO in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue ZARXIO in patients with serious allergic reactions. ZARXIO is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Sickle cell crisis, in some cases fatal, has been reported with the use of filgrastim products in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of ZARXIO. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim. The use of ZARXIO for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating ZARXIO therapy. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\\342\\200\\232 the risks and benefits of continuing ZARXIO should be carefully considered. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\\342\\200\\232000/mm3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving ZARXIO as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\\342\\200\\232 to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\\342\\200\\232 it is recommended that ZARXIO therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\\342\\200\\232000/mm3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of ZARXIO that increase the ANC beyond 10\\342\\200\\232000/mm3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\\342\\200\\232 discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\\342\\200\\232 with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of ZARXIO for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue ZARXIO if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm3. 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\\342\\200\\232 the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold ZARXIO therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. ZARXIO may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells ZARXIO is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G\\302\\255CSF) receptor through which ZARXIO acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that ZARXIO acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When ZARXIO is used to mobilize PBPC\\342\\200\\232 tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\\342\\200\\232 and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of ZARXIO given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\\342\\200\\232 do not use ZARXIO in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. The safety and efficacy of ZARXIO have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of ZARXIO with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Splenic Rupture: Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (5.1) -Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Monitor for and manage immediately. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (5.2) -Allergic reactions (angioneurotic edema, dermatitis allergic, drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity, rash, pruritic rash and urticaria) (5.3) -Sickle cell crisis: Severe and sometimes fatal crisis can occur. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (5.4) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Monitor if symptoms develop and administer standard symptomatic treatment (5.5) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, can occur following administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. In patients who report upper abdominal or shoulder pain after receiving GRANIX, discontinue GRANIX and evaluate for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress after receiving GRANIX, for ARDS. Discontinue GRANIX in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Reactions can occur on initial exposure. The administration of antihistamines\\342\\200\\232 steroids\\342\\200\\232 bronchodilators\\342\\200\\232 and/or epinephrine may reduce the severity of the reactions. Permanently discontinue GRANIX in patients with serious allergic reactions. Do not administer GRANIX to patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. 5.4 Use in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disease receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Consider the potential risks and benefits prior to the administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors in patients with sickle cell disease. Discontinue GRANIX in patients undergoing a sickle cell crisis. 5.5 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.6 Potential for Tumor Growth Stimulatory Effects on Malignant Cells The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which GRANIX acts has been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that GRANIX acts as a growth factor for any tumor type, including myeloid malignancies and myelodysplasia, diseases for which GRANIX is not approved, cannot be excluded."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potential serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: - Splenic Rupture [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] - Serious Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] - Use in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] - Capillary Leak Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] - Potential for Tumor Growth Stimulatory Effects on Malignant Cells [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common treatment-emergent adverse reaction that occurred at an incidence of at least 1% or greater in patients treated with GRANIX at the recommended dose and was numerically two times more frequent than in the placebo group was bone pain. -Most common adverse reaction to GRANIX is bone pain (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA at 1-866-832-8537 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. GRANIX clinical trials safety data are based upon the results of three randomized clinical trials in patients receiving myeloablative chemotherapy for breast cancer (N=348), lung cancer (N=240) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (N=92). In the breast cancer study, 99% of patients were female, the median age was 50 years, and 86% of patients were Caucasian. In the lung cancer study, 80% of patients were male, the median age was 58 years, and 95% of patients were Caucasian. In the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma study, 52% of patients were male, the median age was 55 years, and 88% of patients were Caucasian. In all three studies a placebo (Cycle 1 of the breast cancer study only) or a non-US-approved filgrastim product were used as controls. Both GRANIX and the non-US-approved filgrastim product were administered at 5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once daily beginning one day after chemotherapy for at least five days and continued to a maximum of 14 days or until an ANC of >=10,000 x 106/L after nadir was reached. Bone pain was the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse reaction that occurred in at least 1% or greater in patients treated with GRANIX at the recommended dose and was numerically two times more frequent than in the placebo group. Theoverall incidence of bone pain in Cycle 1 of treatment was 3.4% (3.4% GRANIX, 1.4% placebo, 7.5% non-US-approved filgrastim product). Leukocytosis In clinical studies, leukocytosis (WBC counts > 100,000 x 106/L) was observed in less than 1% patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving GRANIX. No complications attributable to leukocytosis were reported in clinical studies. Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions known to occur following administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors include myalgia, headache, vomiting, Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis), cutaneous vasculitis and thrombocytopenia. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The incidence of antibody development in patients receiving GRANIX has not been adequately determined."$$

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The following adverse reaction data in Table 2 are from three randomized, placebo-controlled studies in patients with: -small cell lung cancer receiving standard dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide\\342\\200\\232 doxorubicin\\342\\200\\232 and etoposide (Study 1) -small cell lung cancer receiving ifosfamide, doxorubicin\\342\\200\\232 and etoposide (Study 2), and -non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, methylprednisolone, and methotrexate ("ACVBP") or mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, mitoguazone, teniposide, methotrexate, folinic acid, methylprednisolone, and methotrexate ("VIM3") (Study 3). A total of 451 patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim 230 mcg/m2 (Study 1), 240 mcg/m2 (Study 2) or 4 or 5 mcg/kg/day (Study 3) (n = 294) or placebo (n = 157). The patients in these studies were median age 61 (range 29 to 78) years and 64% were male. The ethnicity was 95% Caucasian, 4% African American, and 1% Asian. Table 2. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy (With >= 5% Higher Incidence in Filgrastim Compared to Placebo) System Organ Class Preferred Term Filgrastim (N = 294) Placebo (N = 157) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia 38% 29% Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 43% 32% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 48% 29% Chest pain 13% 6% Pain 12% 6% Fatigue 20% 10% Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 15% 8% Arthralgia 9% 2% Bone pain 11% 6% Pain in extremityPercent difference (Filgrastim - Placebo) was 4%. 7% 3% Nervous system disorders Dizziness 14% 3% Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Cough 14% 8% Dyspnea 13% 8% Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 14% 5% Investigations Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased 6% 1% Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 6% 1% Adverse events with >= 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy delivered included anemia, constipation, diarrhea, oral pain, vomiting, asthenia, malaise, edema peripheral, hemoglobin decreased, decreased appetite, oropharyngeal pain, and alopecia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Adverse reaction data below are from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with AML (Study 4) who received an induction chemotherapy regimen of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5 and up to 3 additional courses of therapy (induction 2, and consolidation 1, 2) of intravenous daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and etoposide. The safety population included 518 patients randomized to receive either 5 mcg/kg/day filgrastim (n = 257) or placebo (n = 261). The median age was 54 (range 16 to 89) years and 54% were male. Adverse reactions with >= 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo included epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, and rash maculo-papular. Adverse events with >= 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy included diarrhea, constipation, and transfusion reaction. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4 hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24 hour infusion (Study 6) filgrastim (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male. Adverse reactions with >= 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included rash and hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with >= 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\\342\\200\\232 in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\\342\\200\\232 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (>= 5% Incidence in Filgrastim Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N = 166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving filgrastim (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4 month observation period followed by subcutaneous filgrastim treatment or immediate subcutaneous filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: -Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day -Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day -Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with >= 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The incidence of antibody development in patients receiving filgrastim has not been adequately determined. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell-based bioassay. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, and the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, timing of sampling, sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to filgrastim reported in this section with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other filgrastim products may be misleading. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. -splenic rupture and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] -acute respiratory distress syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] -anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 5.3)] -sickle cell disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] -glomerulonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] -alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] -capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] -leukocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] -cutaneous vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] -Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) -decreased bone density and osteoporosis in pediatric patients receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim products"$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies between GRANIX and other drugs have been performed. Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils\\342\\200\\232 such as lithium\\342\\200\\232 should be used with caution. Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience Cancer Patients Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy In clinical trials involving over 350 patients receiving NEUPOGEN(R) following nonmyeloablative cytotoxic chemotherapy\\342\\200\\232 most adverse experiences were the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy. In all phase 2 and 3 trials\\342\\200\\232 medullary bone pain\\342\\200\\232 reported in 24% of patients\\342\\200\\232 was the only consistently observed adverse reaction attributed to NEUPOGEN(R) therapy. This bone pain was generally reported to be of mild-to-moderate severity\\342\\200\\232 and could be controlled in most patients with non-narcotic analgesics; infrequently\\342\\200\\232 bone pain was severe enough to require narcotic analgesics. Bone pain was reported more frequently in patients treated with higher doses (20 to 100 mcg/kg/day) administered IV\\342\\200\\232 and less frequently in patients treated with lower SC doses of NEUPOGEN(R) (3 to 10 mcg/kg/day). In the randomized\\342\\200\\232 double-blind\\342\\200\\232 placebo-controlled trial of NEUPOGEN(R) therapy following combination chemotherapy in patients (n = 207) with small cell lung cancer\\342\\200\\232 the following adverse events were reported during blinded cycles of study medication (placebo or NEUPOGEN(R) at 4 to 8 mcg/kg/day). Events are reported as exposure-adjusted since patients remained on double-blind NEUPOGEN(R) a median of 3 cycles versus 1 cycle for placebo. % of Blinded Cycles With Events NEUPOGEN(R) N = 384 Patient Cycles Placebo N = 257 Patient Cycles Event Nausea/Vomiting 57 64 Skeletal Pain 22 11 Alopecia 18 27 Diarrhea 14 23 Neutropenic Fever 13 35 Mucositis 12 20 Fever 12 11 Fatigue 11 16 Anorexia 9 11 Dyspnea 9 11 Headache 7 9 Cough 6 8 Skin Rash 6 9 Chest Pain 5 6 Generalized Weakness 4 7 Sore Throat 4 9 Stomatitis 5 10 Constipation 5 10 Pain (Unspecified) 2 7 In this study\\342\\200\\232 there were no serious\\342\\200\\232 life-threatening\\342\\200\\232 or fatal adverse reactions attributed to NEUPOGEN(R) therapy. Specifically\\342\\200\\232 there were no reports of flu-like symptoms\\342\\200\\232 pleuritis\\342\\200\\232 pericarditis\\342\\200\\232 or other major systemic reactions to NEUPOGEN(R). Spontaneously reversible elevations in uric acid\\342\\200\\232 lactate dehydrogenase\\342\\200\\232 and alkaline phosphatase occurred in 27% to 58% of 98 patients receiving blinded NEUPOGEN(R) therapy following cytotoxic chemotherapy; increases were generally mild-to-moderate. Transient decreases in blood pressure (less than 90/60 mmHg)\\342\\200\\232 which did not require clinical treatment\\342\\200\\232 were reported in 7 of 176 patients in phase 3 clinical studies following administration of NEUPOGEN(R). Cardiac events (myocardial infarctions\\342\\200\\232 arrhythmias) have been reported in 11 of 375 cancer patients receiving NEUPOGEN(R) in clinical studies; the relationship to NEUPOGEN(R) therapy is unknown. No evidence of interaction of NEUPOGEN(R) with other drugs was observed in the course of clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS ). There has been no evidence for the development of antibodies or of a blunted or diminished response to NEUPOGEN(R) in treated patients\\342\\200\\232 including those receiving NEUPOGEN(R) daily for almost 2 years. Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia In a randomized phase 3 clinical trial, 259 patients received NEUPOGEN(R) and 262 patients received placebo postchemotherapy. Overall, the frequency of all reported adverse events was similar in both the NEUPOGEN(R) and placebo groups (83% vs 82% in Induction 1; 61% vs 64% in Consolidation 1). Adverse events reported more frequently in the NEUPOGEN(R)-treated group included: petechiae (17% vs 14%), epistaxis (9% vs 5%), and transfusion reactions (10% vs 5%). There were no significant differences in the frequency of these events. There were a similar number of deaths in each treatment group during induction (25 NEUPOGEN(R) vs 27 placebo). The primary causes of death included infection (9 vs 18), persistent leukemia (7 vs 5), and hemorrhage (6 vs 3). Of the hemorrhagic deaths, 5 cerebral hemorrhages were reported in the NEUPOGEN(R) group and 1 in the placebo group. Other serious nonfatal hemorrhagic events were reported in the respiratory tract (4 vs 1), skin (4 vs 4), gastrointestinal tract (2 vs 2), urinary tract (1 vs 1), ocular (1 vs 0), and other nonspecific sites (2 vs 1). While 19 (7%) patients in the NEUPOGEN(R) group and 5 (2%) patients in the placebo group experienced severe or fatal hemorrhagic events, overall, hemorrhagic adverse events were reported at a similar frequency in both groups (40% vs 38%). The time to transfusion-independent platelet recovery and the number of days of platelet transfusions were similar in both groups. Cancer Patients Receiving Bone Marrow Transplant In clinical trials\\342\\200\\232 the reported adverse effects were those typically seen in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant (BMT). The most common events reported in both control and treatment groups included stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting\\342\\200\\232 generally of mild-to-moderate severity and were considered unrelated to NEUPOGEN(R). In the randomized studies of BMT involving 167 patients who received study drug\\342\\200\\232 the following events occurred more frequently in patients treated with Filgrastim than in controls: nausea (10% vs 4%)\\342\\200\\232 vomiting (7% vs 3%)\\342\\200\\232 hypertension (4% vs 0%)\\342\\200\\232 rash (12% vs 10%)\\342\\200\\232 and peritonitis (2% vs 0%). None of these events were reported by the investigator to be related to NEUPOGEN(R). One event of erythema nodosum was reported moderate in severity and possibly related to NEUPOGEN(R). Generally\\342\\200\\232 adverse events observed in nonrandomized studies were similar to those seen in randomized studies\\342\\200\\232 occurred in a minority of patients, and were of mild-to-moderate severity. In one study (n = 45)\\342\\200\\232 3 serious adverse events reported by the investigator were considered possibly related to NEUPOGEN(R). These included 2 events of renal insufficiency and 1 event of capillary leak syndrome. The relationship of these events to NEUPOGEN(R) remains unclear since they occurred in patients with culture-proven infection with clinical sepsis who were receiving potentially nephrotoxic antibacterial and antifungal therapy. Cancer Patients Undergoing Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy In clinical trials\\342\\200\\232 126 patients received NEUPOGEN(R) for PBPC mobilization. In this setting\\342\\200\\232 NEUPOGEN(R) was generally well tolerated. Adverse events related to NEUPOGEN(R) consisted primarily of mild-to-moderate musculoskeletal symptoms\\342\\200\\232 reported in 44% of patients. These symptoms were predominantly events of medullary bone pain (33%). Headache was reported related to NEUPOGEN(R) in 7% of patients. Transient increases in alkaline phosphatase related to NEUPOGEN(R) were reported in 21% of the patients who had serum chemistries measured; most were mild-to-moderate. All patients had increases in neutrophil counts during mobilization\\342\\200\\232 consistent with the biological effects of NEUPOGEN(R). Two patients had a WBC count greater than 100\\342\\200\\232000/mm3. No sequelae were associated with any grade of leukocytosis. Sixty-five percent of patients had mild-to-moderate anemia and 97% of patients had decreases in platelet counts; 5 patients (out of 126) had decreased platelet counts to less than 50\\342\\200\\232000/mm3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia have been reported to be related to leukapheresis; however\\342\\200\\232 the possibility that NEUPOGEN(R) mobilization may contribute to anemia or thrombocytopenia has not been ruled out. Patients With Severe Chronic Neutropenia Mild-to-moderate bone pain was reported in approximately 33% of patients in clinical trials. This symptom was readily controlled with non-narcotic analgesics. Generalized musculoskeletal pain was also noted in higher frequency in patients treated with NEUPOGEN(R). Palpable splenomegaly was observed in approximately 30% of patients. Abdominal or flank pain was seen infrequently, and thrombocytopenia (less than 50\\342\\200\\232000/mm3) was noted in 12% of patients with palpable spleens. Fewer than 3% of all patients underwent splenectomy\\342\\200\\232 and most of these had a prestudy history of splenomegaly. Fewer than 6% of patients had thrombocytopenia (less than 50\\342\\200\\232000/mm3) during NEUPOGEN(R) therapy\\342\\200\\232 most of whom had a pre-existing history of thrombocytopenia. In most cases\\342\\200\\232 thrombocytopenia was managed by NEUPOGEN(R) dose reduction or interruption. An additional 5% of patients had platelet counts between 50\\342\\200\\232000 and 100\\342\\200\\232000/mm3. There were no associated serious hemorrhagic sequelae in these patients. Epistaxis was noted in 15% of patients treated with NEUPOGEN(R)\\342\\200\\232 but was associated with thrombocytopenia in 2% of patients. Anemia was reported in approximately 10% of patients\\342\\200\\232 but in most cases appeared to be related to frequent diagnostic phlebotomy\\342\\200\\232 chronic illness, or concomitant medications. Other adverse events infrequently observed and possibly related to NEUPOGEN(R) therapy were: injection site reaction\\342\\200\\232 rash\\342\\200\\232 hepatomegaly\\342\\200\\232 arthralgia\\342\\200\\232 osteoporosis\\342\\200\\232 cutaneous vasculitis\\342\\200\\232 hematuria/proteinuria\\342\\200\\232 alopecia\\342\\200\\232 and exacerbation of some pre-existing skin disorders (eg\\342\\200\\232 psoriasis). Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have been observed in patients treated with NEUPOGEN(R) for SCN (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ). As of 31 December 1997, data were available from a postmarketing surveillance study of 531 SCN patients with an average follow-up of 4.0 years. Based on analysis of these data, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. A life-table analysis of these data revealed that the cumulative risk of developing leukemia or MDS by the end of the 8th year of NEUPOGEN(R) treatment in a patient with congenital neutropenia was 16.5% (95% C.I. = 9.8%, 23.3%); this represents an annual rate of approximately 2%. Cytogenetic abnormalities, most commonly involving chromosome 7, have been reported in patients treated with NEUPOGEN(R) who had previously documented normal cytogenetics. It is unknown whether the development of cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS, or AML is related to chronic daily NEUPOGEN(R) administration or to the natural history of congenital neutropenia. It is also unknown if the rate of conversion in patients who have not received NEUPOGEN(R) is different from that of patients who have received NEUPOGEN(R). Routine monitoring through regular CBCs is recommended for all SCN patients. Additionally, annual bone marrow and cytogenetic evaluations are recommended in all patients with congenital neutropenia (see LABORATORY MONITORING ). Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval of NEUPOGEN(R). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. splenic rupture (see WARNINGS : Splenic Rupture ) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see WARNINGS : Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ) alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis (see WARNINGS : Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis ) sickle cell crisis (see WARNINGS : Sickle Cell Disorders ) cutaneous vasculitis (see PRECAUTIONS : Cutaneous Vasculitis ) Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)"$$
