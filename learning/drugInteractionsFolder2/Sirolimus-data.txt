"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions ( 5.4 ) Angioedema ( 5.5 ) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing ( 5.6 ) Hyperlipidemia ( 5.7 ) Renal Function ( 5.8 ) Proteinuria ( 5.9 ) Interstitial Lung Disease ( 5.10 ) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine ( 5.11 ) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for Rapamune-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increasesusceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Rapamune. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.3 Lung Transplantation - Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.5 Angioedema Rapamune has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Rapamune with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving Rapamune. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with Rapamune compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43-46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45-57%) in patients receiving Rapamune compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune. Any patient who is administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and/or fibrates appeared to be well-tolerated. During Rapamune therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of Rapamune with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and Rapamune were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving Rapamune and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of Rapamune and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, Rapamune may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients 6-120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to Rapamune compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to Rapamune conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion.New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the Rapamune conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the Rapamune conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of Rapamune. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.11 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.12 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.13 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.14 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring The label-recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. These concentration values are not interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.16 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of Rapamune with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7)]."$$

Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended.

In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.5) ]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation - Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.7) ]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1) ]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.

The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (< 1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the coadministration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function.

Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.7) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus.

Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7) ]."$$

These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latents Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for Sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5)]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation - Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (< 1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the coadministration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]."$$

The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latent Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for Rapamune-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 )]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Rapamune for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of Rapamune has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6-144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a Rapamune-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation - Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. 5.5 Angioedema Rapamune has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Rapamune with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving Rapamune. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with Rapamune compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43-46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45-57%) in patients receiving Rapamune compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune. Any patient who is administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving Rapamune plus cyclosporine or Rapamune after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of Rapamune on cardiovascular mortality. During Rapamune therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of Rapamune with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function.

Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of Rapamune and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients.

In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients.

"7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when coadministered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.17), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the coadministered drug may need to be adjusted [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum ) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."$$
"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4,12.3). Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp).
