"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Seizures: Can occur within the recommended dose range. Concomitant use with certain other drugs may increase the seizure risk. Risk of convulsions, may increase in patients with epilepsy, history of seizures, and with a recognized risk for seizure. (5.1,5.9) -Suicide: Do not prescribe for suicidal or addiction-prone patients. (5.2) -Serotonin Syndrome: May be life-threatening. Can occur with tramadol alone or with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs or those that inhibit metabolism of tramadol. (5.3,5.9) -Anaphylactoid Reactions: Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have occurred. Increased risk in patients with history of anaphylactoid reactions to other opioids. (5.4) -Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have occurred. Increased risk in patients with history of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, often after the first dose. Other reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, TEN, SJS. (5.4) -Respiratory Depression: Administer cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. (5.5) -CNS Depression: Use with caution and in reduced dosages in patients taking CNS depressants and in patients at risk for CNS depression. Patients should not consume alcohol-containing beverages while using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release. (5.6, 5.12) -Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma: Use with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. (5.7) -Ambulatory Patients: Tramadol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for potentially hazardous tasks. (5.8) -Tapering may reduce withdrawal symptoms. (5.10) -Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion: Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. (5.11) -Overdosage can cause CNS and respiratory depression and death. (5.12) -Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate clinical assessment of acute abdominal conditions. (5.13) 5.1 Seizure Risk Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1, 7.2)] -Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics, -Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), -Other opioids, -MAO inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)], -Neuroleptics, or -Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure. 5.2 Suicide Risk -Do not prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.2)]. -Prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. -Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with use of tramadol products, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended- Release, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs) and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 5.4 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Respiratory Depression Administer Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. If large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.6 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants, Including Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients. Alcohol-containing beverages should not be consumed by patients using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.7 Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. 5.8 Use in Ambulatory Patients Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse reactions, including seizure and serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.3)]. 5.10 Withdrawal Symptoms Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Clinical experience with other formulations of tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release when discontinuing tramadol therapy. 5.11 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release contains tramadol, an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release could be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12), DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.12 Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.13 Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions."$$

Caution patients initiating therapy with ConZip(TM) or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use ConZip(TM) with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of ConZip(TM) with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse reactions, including seizure and serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.3)]. 5.10 Withdrawal Symptoms Withdrawal symptoms may occur if ConZip(TM) is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Clinical experience with other formulations of tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering ConZip(TM) when discontinuing tramadol therapy. 5.11 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids ConZip(TM) contains tramadol, an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing ConZip(TM) in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. ConZip(TM) could be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13), DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.12 Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with ConZip(TM) are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.13 Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of ConZip(TM) may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Seizures: Can occur within the recommended dose range. Concomitant use with certain other drugs may increase the seizure risk. Risk of convulsions may increase in patients with epilepsy, history of seizures, and with a recognized risk for seizure. (5.1, 5.9) -Suicide: Do not prescribe for suicidal or addiction-prone patients. (5.2) -Serotonin Syndrome: May be life-threatening. Can occur with tramadol alone or with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs or those that inhibit metabolism of tramadol. (5.3. 5.9) -Anaphylactoid Reactions: Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have occurred. Increased risk in patients with history of anaphylactoid reactions to other opioids. (5.4) -Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, often after the first dose. Other reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, TEN, SJS. (5.4) -Respiratory Depression: Administer cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. (5.5) -CNS Depression: Use with caution and in reduced dosages in patients taking CNS depressants and in patients at risk for CNS depression. Patients should not consume alcohol-containing beverages while using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release (5.6, 5.12) -Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma: Use with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. (5.7) -Ambulatory Patients: Tramadol may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for potentially hazardous tasks. (5.8) -Tapering may reduce withdrawal symptoms. (5.10) -Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion: Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. (5.11) -Overdosage can cause CNS and respiratory depression and death. (5.13) -Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate clinical assessment of acute abdominal conditions. (5.14) 5.1 Seizure Risk Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1, 7.2)] -Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics, -Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), -Other opioids, -MAO inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)], -Neuroleptics, or -Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure. 5.2 Suicide Risk -Do not prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.2)]. -Prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)]. -Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with use of tramadol products, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release , particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs) and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 5.4 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Respiratory Depression Administer Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. If large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.6 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants, Including Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients. Alcohol-containing beverages should not be consumed by patients using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.7 Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. 5.8 Use in Ambulatory Patients Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.2) ]. Prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)]. Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with use of tramadol products, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs) and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 5.4 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Respiratory Depression Administer Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. If large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.6 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants, Including Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients. Alcohol-containing beverages should not be consumed by patients using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.7 Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. 5.8 Use in Ambulatory Patients Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse reactions, including seizure and serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.3)]. 5.10 Withdrawal Symptoms Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Clinical experience with other formulations of tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release when discontinuing tramadol therapy. 5.11 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release contains tramadol, an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release could be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13), DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.12 Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.13 Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions."$$

(5.14) 5.1 Seizure Risk Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( , )] 7.1 7.2 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics, Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), Other opioids, MAO inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( )], 5.9 7.1 Neuroleptics, or Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure. 5.2 Suicide Risk Do not prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ( ) 9.2 ].

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS SSRI/SNRI antidepressants or anorectics, TCA antidepressants, other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics or other drugs that lower seizure threshold: Risk of seizures increased with concomitant use of tramadol. (7.1) CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 Inhibitors: May result in increased tramadol concentrations. (7.2) Serotonergic Drugs, Triptans, and CNS Depressants: Enhanced risk of adverse reactions. (7.3, 7.4, and 7.5) Carbamazepine: Reduces analgesic effects of tramadol. (7.6) Quinidine: May result in increased concentration of tramadol and reduced concentrations of its active metabolite, M1. (7.7) Digoxin and Warfarin: Rare reports of digoxin toxicity; altered warfarin effect and elevation of prothrombin time. (7.8) 7.1 Drugs Affecting Seizure Threshold Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking SSRI/SNRI antidepressants or anorectics, TCA antidepressants and other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics or other drugs that lower the seizure threshold [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 7.2 CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form the active metabolite, O-desmethyl tramadol (M1). In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4 [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin with ConZip(R) may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs There have been post-marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when ConZip(R) is co-administered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of ConZip(R) with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.4 Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when ConZip(R) is co-administered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of ConZip(R) with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.5 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants ConZip(R) should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. ConZip(R) increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 7.6 Quinidine Quinidine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of quinidine with an extended-release tramadol product resulted in a 50-60% increase in tramadol exposure and a 50-60% decrease in M1 exposure. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. 7.7 Digoxin and Warfarins Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. 7.8 CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort, with ConZip(R) may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to reduced tramadol exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of ConZip(R) and carbamazepine is not recommended."$$

Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs There have been post-marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when ConZip(TM) is co-administered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of ConZip(TM) with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.4 Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when ConZip(TM) is co-administered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of ConZip(TM) with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.5 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants ConZip(TM) should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. ConZip(TM) increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 7.6 Quinidine Quinidine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of quinidine with an extended-release tramadol product resulted in a 50-60% increase in tramadol exposure and a 50-60% decrease in M1 exposure. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. 7.7 Digoxin and Warfarins Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. 7.8 CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort, with ConZip(TM) may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to reduced tramadol exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of ConZip(TM) and carbamazepine is not recommended."$$

( ) 7.8 7.1 Drugs Affecting Seizure Threshold Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking SSRI/SNRI antidepressants or anorectics, TCA antidepressants and other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics or other drugs that lower the seizure threshold [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( ) 5.1 ]. 7.2 CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form the active metabolite, O-desmethyl tramadol (M1). drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. In vitro Tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4 . Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( )] 12.3 Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome . [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( )] 12.3 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs There have been post-marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is co-administered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( )]. 5.3 7.4 Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is co-administered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( )]. 5.3 7.5 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( )]. 5.6 7.6 Quinidine Quinidine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of quinidine with an extended-release tramadol product resulted in a 50-60% increase in tramadol exposure and a 50-60% decrease in M1 exposure. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( )]. In vitro 12.3 7.7 Digoxin and Warfarins Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. 7.8 CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort, with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to reduced tramadol exposure . [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( ) 12.3 ] Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release and carbamazepine is not recommended."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION Tramadol hydrochloride was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol hydrochloride administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride and the active control groups, TYLENOL(R) with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride groups.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Tramadol hydrochloride tablets were administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride and the active control groups, TYLENOL(R) with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol groups. 1 \\\\"CNS Stimulation\\\\" is a composite of nervousness, anxiety, agitation, tremor, spasticity, euphoria, emotional lability and hallucinations.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Tramadol hydrochloride was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol hydrochloride administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride and the active control groups, TYLENOL(R) with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg, however, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride groups.

"CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ), such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome. Serotonergic Drugs There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS , Serotonin Syndrome ). Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome ). Use With Carbamazepine Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride and carbamazepine is not recommended. Use With Quinidine Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and tramadol hydrochloride results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tramadol In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers, such as rifampin and St. John's Wort, with tramadol hydrochloride may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals. Use With Cimetidine Concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride with cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the tramadol hydrochloride dosage regimen is recommended. Use With Digoxin and Warfarin Post-marketing surveillance has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in a mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg (90 mg/m 2 or 0.36 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m 2) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No such finding occurred in a rat carcinogenicity study (dosing orally up to 30 mg/kg, 180 mg/m 2, or 0.73 times the maximum daily human dosage). Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames Salmonella microsomal activation test, CHO/HPRT mammalian cell assay, mouse lymphoma assay (in the absence of metabolic activation), dominant lethal mutation tests in mice, chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamsters, and bone marrow micronucleus tests in mice and Chinese hamsters. Weakly mutagenic results occurred in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay and micronucleus test in rats. Overall, the weight of evidence from these tests indicates that tramadol does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m 2) in male rats and 75 mg/kg (450 mg/m 2) in female rats. These dosages are 1.2 and 1.8 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m 2, respectively. Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg or 360 mg/m2), rats (>=25 mg/kg or 150 mg/m 2) and rabbits (>=75 mg/kg or 900 mg/m 2) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These dosages on a mg/m2 basis are 1.4, >=0.6, and >=3.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m2) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively. No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg or 420 mg/m2), rats (up to 80 mg/kg or 480 mg/m2) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg or 3600 mg/m 2) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg (3600 mg/m 2), a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 1.7, 1.9 and 14.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m 2), respectively. Non-teratogenic Effects Tramadol was evaluated in peri- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m 2 or 1.2 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (480 mg/m 2 or 1.9 and higher the maximum daily human dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tramadol hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and still birth have been reported during post-marketing."$$
"Drug Interactions CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \\342\\200\\224 Pharmacokinetics), such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome. Serotonergic Drugs: There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets are coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome). Triptans: Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride ER tablet is coadministered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS - Serotonin Syndrome). Use With Carbamazepine Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets and carbamazepine is not recommended. Use With Quinidine Coadministration of quinidine with tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets resulted in a 50 to 60% increase in tramadol exposure and a 50 to 60% decrease in M1 exposure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions). The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. Use With Digoxin and Warfarin Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tramadol In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers, such as rifampin and St. John's Wort, with tramadol hydrochloride ER tablets may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses.

Serotonergic Drugs There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS: Serotonin Syndrome). Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when tramadol hydrochloride is coadministered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of tramadol hydrochloride with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS: Serotonin Syndrome). Use with Carbamazepine Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride and carbamazepine is not recommended. Use with Quinidine Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and tramadol hydrochloride results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tramadol In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers, such as rifampin and St. John's Wort, with tramadol hydrochloride may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals. Use with Cimetidine Concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride with cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the tramadol hydrochloride dosage regimen is recommended.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A slight, but statistically significant, increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in a mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg (90 mg/m2 or 0.36 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m2) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No such finding occurred in a rat carcinogenicity study (dosing orally up to 30 mg/kg, 180 mg/m2, or 0.73 times the maximum daily human dosage). Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames Salmonella microsomal activation test, CHO/HPRT mammalian cell assay, mouse lymphoma assay (in the absence of metabolic activation), dominant lethal mutation tests in mice, chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamsters, and bone marrow micronucleus tests in mice and Chinese hamsters. Weakly mutagenic results occurred in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay and micronucleus test in rats. Overall, the weight of evidence from these tests indicates that tramadol does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans. No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m2) in male rats and 75 mg/kg (450 mg/m2) in female rats. These dosages are 1.2 and 1.8 times the maximum daily human dosage of 246 mg/m2, respectively. Pregnancy, Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg or 360 mg/m2), rats (>=25 mg/kg or 150 mg/m2) and rabbits (>=75 mg/kg or 900 mg/m2) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These dosages on a mg/m2 basis are 1.4, >=0.6, and >=3.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m2) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively. No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg or 420 mg/m2), rats (up to 80 mg/kg or 480 mg/m2) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg or 3600 mg/m2) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg (3600 mg/m2), a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 1.7, 1.9 and 14.6 times the maximum daily human dosage (246 mg/m2), respectively. Non-teratogenic Effects Tramadol was evaluated in peri- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m2or 1.2 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (480 mg/m2 or 1.9 and higher the maximum daily human dose). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tramadol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and still birth have been reported during post-marketing. Labor and Delivery Tramadol should not be used in pregnant women prior to or during labor unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Chronic use during pregnancy may lead to physical dependence and post-partum withdrawal symptoms in the newborn (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor. The effect of tramadol, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tramadol is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post-delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied. Following a single IV 100 mg dose of tramadol, the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours postdose was 100 \\316\\274g of tramadol (0.1% of the maternal dose) and 27 \\316\\274g of M1. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of tramadol in patients under 16 years of age have not been established. The use of tramadol in the pediatric population is not recommended. Geriatric Use In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In patients over 75 years of age, daily doses in excess of 300 mg are not recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). A total of 455 elderly (65 years of age or older) subjects were exposed to tramadol in controlled clinical trials. Of those, 145 subjects were 75 years of age and older. In studies including geriatric patients, treatment-limiting adverse events were higher in subjects over 75 years of age compared to those under 65 years of age. Specifically, 30% of those over 75 years of age had gastrointestinal treatment-limiting adverse events compared to 17% of those under 65 years of age. Constipation resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 10% of those over 75."$$

The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tramadol In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or inducers, such as rifampin and St. John's Wort, with ULTRACET(R) may affect the metabolism of tramadol, leading to altered tramadol exposure. Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals. Use With Cimetidine Concomitant administration of ULTRACET(R) and cimetidine has not been studied. Concomitant administration of tramadol and cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the ULTRACET(R) dosage regimen is recommended. Use With Digoxin Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity. Use With Warfarin-Like Compounds Post-marketing surveillance of both tramadol and acetaminophen individual products have revealed rare alterations of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times.

"DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION 7.1 Drugs Affecting Seizure Threshold Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking SSRI/SNRI antidepressants or anorectics, TCA antidepressants and other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics or other drugs that lower the seizure threshold [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 7.2 CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form the active metabolite, O-desmethyl tramadol (M1). In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol. Tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4 [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure. Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and amitriptyline (CYP2D6 inhibitors), and ketoconazole and erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitors), may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs There have been post-marketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs/SNRIs or MAOIs and \\316\\2612-adrenergic blockers. Caution is advised when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is co-administered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as SSRIs, MAOIs, triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), lithium, or St. John's Wort. If concomitant treatment of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.4 Triptans Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is co-administered with a triptan. If concomitant treatment of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. 7.5 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 7.6 Quinidine Quinidine is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of quinidine with an extended-release tramadol product resulted in a 50-60% increase in tramadol exposure and a 50-60% decrease in M1 exposure. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism. 7.7 Digoxin and Warfarins Post-marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times. 7.8 CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort, with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to reduced tramadol exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.1 Seizure Risk Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1, 7.2)] Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) antidepressants or anorectics, Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), Other opioids, MAO inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)], Neuroleptics, or Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure. 5.2 Suicide Risk Do not prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone. Consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9.2)]. Prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)]. Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with use of tramadol products, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release , particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs) and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose. [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 5.4 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Respiratory Depression Administer Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. If large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.6 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants, Including Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients. Alcohol-containing beverages should not be consumed by patients using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.7 Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. 5.8 Use in Ambulatory Patients Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse reactions, including seizure and serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.3)]. 5.10 Withdrawal Symptoms Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Clinical experience with other formulations of tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release when discontinuing tramadol therapy. 5.11 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release contains tramadol, an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release could be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13), DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.12 Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.13 Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions."$$

Prescribe Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5)]. Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)]. 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with use of tramadol products, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended- Release, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs) and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose. [See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). 5.4 Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.5 Respiratory Depression Administer Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. If large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.6 Interaction With Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants, Including Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression. Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients. Alcohol-containing beverages should not be consumed by patients using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.7 Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. 5.8 Use in Ambulatory Patients Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release or those whose dose has been increased to refrain from potentially hazardous activities until it is established that their mental and physical abilities are not significantly impaired. 5.9 Use With MAO Inhibitors and SSRIs Use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration. Concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release with MAO inhibitors or SSRI's increases the risk of adverse reactions, including seizure and serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.3)]. 5.10 Withdrawal Symptoms Withdrawal symptoms may occur if Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Clinical experience with other formulations of tramadol suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release when discontinuing tramadol therapy. 5.11 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release contains tramadol, an opioid agonist of the morphine-type. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release could be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12), DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9), and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board, or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.12 Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment [see OVERDOSAGE (10)]. 5.13 Acute Abdominal Conditions The administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions."$$
