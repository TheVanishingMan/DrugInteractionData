Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole tablets 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole tablets 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of ropinirole tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole tablets. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole tablets. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole tablets experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole tablets and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole tablets with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole tablets 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole tablets 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole tablets 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole tablets was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole tablets reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole tablets or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole tablets. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Ropinirole tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole tablets than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole tablets. 5.7 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole tablets for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole tablets should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living may occur, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Sudden onset of sleep may occur without apparent warning or daytime drowsiness. Sedating medications (such as alcohol or CNS depressants), the presence of sleeping disorders, or other medications that increase plasma levels of ropinirole, may increase the risk of somnolence or falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Before initiating treatment, patients should be advised of the potential of sudden onset of sleep or to develop drowsiness and asked about risk factors they may have. If a patient develops sudden onset of sleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.) and/or cannot avoid high-risk activities in the future, REQUIP XL should ordinarily be discontinued. (5.1) Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, may occur. (5.2) Symptomatic hypotension (including postural/orthostatic hypotension) may occur, especially during dose escalation. (5.3) Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate may occur. (5.4) Hallucination may occur. (5.5) Dyskinesia may be caused or exacerbated. Decreasing the L-dopa dose may lessen or eliminate this side effect. (5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received REQUIP XL in clinical trials, there were 5 cases of sudden onset of sleep and 2 cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor. During the 6-month trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 7% (14 of 202) of patients receiving REQUIP XL compared with 4% (7 of 191) of patients receiving placebo. During the 36-week trial in early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 11% (16 of 140) of patients receiving REQUIP XL compared with 15% (22 of 149) of patients receiving the immediate-release formulation of REQUIP [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. However, because dose-response was not systematically studied with REQUIP XL, the occurrence of somnolence at the highest recommended doses may be higher than these reported frequencies [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with REQUIP XL, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with REQUIP XL such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating, etc.), REQUIP XL should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration for guidance in discontinuing REQUIP XL (2.2)]. If a decision is made to continue REQUIP XL, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed during treatment with ropinirole in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled study involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received REQUIP XL, and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo. Because the study of REQUIP XL excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, it is not known to what extent the estimated incidence figure applies to patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. Therefore, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving REQUIP XL and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving REQUIP XL, and in 1% of placebo recipients. An analysis of the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with REQUIP XL (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). This increased incidence was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this study. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the study in the advanced Parkinson's disease study and changes related to REQUIP XL (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of any orthostatic hypotension at any time during the study was 38% for REQUIP XL vs. 31% for placebo for mild to moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), 63% for REQUIP XL vs. 58% for placebo for mild to moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=10 mm Hg), 10% for REQUIP XL vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), and 23% for REQUIP XL vs. 19% for placebo for mild to moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking REQUIP XL. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for REQUIP XL vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for REQUIP XL vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of REQUIP XL on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. However, there was an increased incidence of patients treated with REQUIP XL who met various outlier criteria, as described below. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for REQUIP XL vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for REQUIP XL vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for REQUIP XL vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>=15 beats/minute), and 19% for REQUIP XL vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for REQUIP XL vs. <1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>=30 beats/minute), and 24% for REQUIP XL vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking REQUIP XL should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucination In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving REQUIP XL reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo. Hallucination led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on REQUIP XL and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in patients over age 65. Coadministration of entacapone and L-dopa with ropinirole may also increase the risk of hallucination. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, hallucination occurred in 0 of 43 patients taking entacapone plus L-dopa, in 9 of 155 patients taking REQUIP XL plus L-dopa (6%), and in 7 of 47 patients taking entacapone with REQUIP XL plus L-dopa (15%). 5.6 Dyskinesia REQUIP XL may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. Decreasing the dose of a dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this side effect. 5.7 Major Psychotic Disorders Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with REQUIP XL because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, many treatments for psychosis may decrease the effectiveness of REQUIP XL [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion: Although not reported during the clinical development of ropinirole, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with REQUIP XL as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Fibrotic Complications: Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as REQUIP or REQUIP XL, can cause them is unknown. A small number of reports have been received of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy, in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with REQUIP XL had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be completely ruled out in rare cases. Melanoma: Some epidemiologic studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (perhaps 2- to 4-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, was unclear. Ropinirole is one of the dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease. Although ropinirole has not been associated with an increased risk of melanoma specifically, its potential role as a risk factor has not been systematically studied. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with REQUIP XL and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. Patients using REQUIP XL should be made aware of these results and undergo periodic dermatologic screening. 5.9 Retinal Pathology Human: Because of observations made in albino rats (see below), ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, l-dopa controlled clinical study of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease. A total of 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose 11.9 mg/day and 78 on l-dopa, mean dose 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the study. Albino Rats: Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in pigmented rats after 3 months in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The potential significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding) may be involved. 5.10 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$

(5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received ropinirole extended-release tablets in clinical trials, there were 5 cases of sudden onset of sleep and 2 cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor.

If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating, etc.), ropinirole extended-release tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration for guidance in discontinuing ropinirole extended-release tablets ( 2.2 )]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed during treatment with ropinirole in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled study involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo. Because the study of ropinirole extended-release tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, it is not known to what extent the estimated incidence figure applies to patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. Therefore, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.2 )]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in 1% of placebo recipients. An analysis of the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with ropinirole extended-release tablets (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). This increased incidence was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this study. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the study in the advanced Parkinson's disease study and changes related to ropinirole extended-release tablets (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of any orthostatic hypotension at any time during the study was 38% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 31% for placebo for mild to moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), 63% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 58% for placebo for mild to moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=10 mm Hg), 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), and 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for mild to moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of ropinirole extended-release tablets on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. However, there was an increased incidence of patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets who met various outlier criteria, as described below. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>=15 beats/minute), and 19% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. <1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>=30 beats/minute), and 24% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucination In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo. Hallucination led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in patients over age 65. Coadministration of entacapone and L-dopa with ropinirole may also increase the risk of hallucination. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, hallucination occurred in 0 of 43 patients taking entacapone plus L-dopa, in 9 of 155 patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets plus L-dopa (6%), and in 7 of 47 patients taking entacapone with ropinirole extended-release tablets plus L-dopa (15%). 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. Decreasing the dose of a dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this side effect. 5.7 Major Psychotic Disorders Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, many treatments for psychosis may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. 5.8 Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion: Athough not reported during the clinical development of ropinirole, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Fibrotic Complications: Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot\\302\\255-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole or ropinirole extended-release tablets, can cause them is unknown. A small number of reports have been received of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy, in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N=613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be completely ruled out in rare cases. Melanoma: Some epidemiologic studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (perhaps 2- to 4-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, was unclear. Ropinirole is one of the dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease. Although ropinirole has not been associated with an increased risk of melanoma specifically, its potential role as a risk factor has not been systematically studied. In the clinical development program (N=613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. Patients using ropinirole extended-release tablets should be made aware of these results and undergo periodic dermatologic screening. 5.9 Retinal Pathology Human: Because of observations made in albino rats (see below), ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa controlled clinical study of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease. A total of 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the study. Albino Rats: Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in pigmented rats after 3 months in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The potential significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding) may be involved. 5.10 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Falling asleep during activities of daily living may occur, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Sudden onset of sleep may occur without apparent warning or daytime drowsiness. Sedating medications (such as alcohol or CNS depressants), the presence of sleeping disorders, or other medications that increase plasma levels of ropinirole, may increase the risk of somnolence or falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Before initiating treatment, patients should be advised of the potential of sudden onset of sleep or to develop drowsiness and asked about risk factors they may have. If a patient develops sudden onset of sleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.) and/or cannot avoid high-risk activities in the future, Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. (5.1) Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, may occur. (5.2) Symptomatic hypotension (including postural/orthostatic hypotension) may occur, especially during dose escalation. (5.3) Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate may occur. (5.4) Hallucination may occur. (5.5) Dyskinesia may be caused or exacerbated. Decreasing the L-dopa dose may lessen or eliminate this side effect. (5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets in clinical trials, there were 5 cases of sudden onset of sleep and 2 cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor. During the 6-month trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 7% (14 of 202) of patients receiving Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets compared with 4% (7 of 191) of patients receiving placebo. During the 36-week trial in early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 11% (16 of 140) of patients receiving Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets compared with 15% (22 of 149) of patients receiving the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. However, because dose-response was not systematically studied with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets, the occurrence of somnolence at the highest recommended doses may be higher than these reported frequencies [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Many clinical experts believe that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living always occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should continually reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating, etc.), Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration for guidance in discontinuing Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets (2.2)]. If a decision is made to continue Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed during treatment with ropinirole in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled study involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo. Because the study of Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, it is not known to what extent the estimated incidence figure applies to patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. Therefore, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets, and in 1% of placebo recipients. An analysis of the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased.

Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg).

Hallucination led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in patients over age 65. Coadministration of entacapone and L-dopa with ropinirole may also increase the risk of hallucination. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, hallucination occurred in 0 of 43 patients taking entacapone plus L-dopa, in 9 of 155 patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets plus L-dopa (6%), and in 7 of 47 patients taking entacapone with ropinirole extended-release tablets plus L-dopa (15%). 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. Decreasing the dose of a dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this side effect. 5.7 Major Psychotic Disorders Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, many treatments for psychosis may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. 5.8 Events Reported With Dopaminergic Therapy Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported during the clinical development of ropinirole, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot\\302\\255-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole or ropinirole extended-release tablets, can cause them is unknown. A small number of reports have been received of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy, in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N=613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be completely ruled out in rare cases. Melanoma Some epidemiologic studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (perhaps 2- to 4-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the observed increased risk was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, was unclear. Ropinirole is one of the dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease. Although ropinirole has not been associated with an increased risk of melanoma specifically, its potential role as a risk factor has not been systematically studied. In the clinical development program (N=613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. Patients using ropinirole extended-release tablets should be made aware of these results and undergo periodic dermatologic screening. 5.9 Retinal Pathology Human Because of observations made in albino rats (see below), ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa controlled clinical study of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease. A total of 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the study. Albino Rats Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in pigmented rats after 3 months in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The potential significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding) may be involved. 5.10 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days. 5.11 Presence of FD&C Yellow #6 (4 mg and 8 mg) This product contains color additives including FD&C Yellow #6 in the 4 mg and 8 mg tablets."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur (5.1) -Syncope may occur (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur (5.3) -Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate may occur (5.4) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors (5.5) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.6) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors (5.7) 5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinary, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received ropinirole extended-release tablets in clinical trials, there were 5 cases of sudden onset of sleep and 2 cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor. During the 6-month trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 7% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 4%of patients receiving placebo. During the 36-week trial in early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 11% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 15% of patients receiving the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. However, because dose-response was not systematically studied with ropinirole extended-release tablets, the occurrence of somnolence at the highest recommended doses may be higher than these reported frequencies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usuallyoccurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole extended-release tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole extended-release tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole extended-release tablets in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because the trial of ropinirole extended-release tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical trials and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatichypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in 1% of placebo recipients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. An analysis of the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with ropinirole extended-release tablets (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). The increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the advanced Parkinson's disease trial and changes related to ropinirole extended-release tablets (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of orthostatic hypotension at any time during the trial was 38% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 31% for placebo for mild to moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), 63% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 58% for placebo for mild-to-moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=10 mm Hg), 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), and 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for mild-to-moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of ropinirole extended-release tablets on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase >=40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>=15 beats/ minute), and 19% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. <1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>=30 beats/minute), and 24% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hallucination led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tabletsbecause of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease dyskinesia was reported as an adverse event in 13% of patients taking ropinirole extended-release tabletsand 3% of patients on placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of a dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this side effect. 5.7 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole extended-release tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. 5.8 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tabletsas a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.9 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2 to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tabletsand also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole extended-release tablets. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tabletshad pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats.

Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event.

If a decision is made to continue REQUIP XL, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with REQUIP XL in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received REQUIP XL, and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because the trial of REQUIP XL excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving REQUIP XL and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving REQUIP XL and in 1% of placebo recipients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. An analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with REQUIP XL (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). The increased incidence with REQUIP XL was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the advanced Parkinson's disease trial and changes related to REQUIP XL (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of orthostatic hypotension at any time during the trial was 38% for REQUIP XL vs. 31% for placebo for mild-to-moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), 63% for REQUIP XL vs. 58% for placebo for mild-to-moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=10 mm Hg), 10% for REQUIP XL vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), and 23% for REQUIP XL vs. 19% for placebo for mild-to-moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking REQUIP XL. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for REQUIP XL vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for REQUIP XL vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of REQUIP XL on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for REQUIP XL vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for REQUIP XL vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for REQUIP XL vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>=15 beats/minute), and 19% for REQUIP XL vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for REQUIP XL vs. <1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>=30 beats/minute), and 24% for REQUIP XL vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking REQUIP XL should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial, 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving REQUIP XL reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hallucinations led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on REQUIP XL and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with REQUIP XL [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with REQUIP XL because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of REQUIP XL [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.6 Dyskinesia REQUIP XL may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesiain patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease dyskinesia was reported as an adverse event in 13% of patients taking REQUIP XL and 3% of patients on placebo[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.7 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including REQUIP XL, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REQUIP XL. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking REQUIP XL. 5.8 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with REQUIP XL as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.9 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with REQUIP XL and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using REQUIP XL. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with REQUIP XL had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur. (5.1) -Syncope may occur. (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur. (5.3) -Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate may occur. (5.4) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors. (5.5) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia. (5.6) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors. (5.7) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received ropinirole extended-release in clinical trials, there were 5 cases of sudden onset of sleep and 2 cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor. During the 6-month trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 7% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release compared with 4% of patients receiving placebo. During the 36-week trial in early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 11% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 15% of patients receiving the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ]. However, because dose-response was not systematically studied with ropinirole extended-release tablets, the occurrence of somnolence at the highest recommended doses may be higher than these reported frequencies [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole extended-release tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) ]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole extended-release tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) ]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole extended-release tablets in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Because the trial of ropinirole extended-release tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists, in clinical trials and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets, and in 1% of placebo recipients [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. An analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with ropinirole extended-release tablets (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). This increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the advanced Parkinson's disease trial and changes related to ropinirole extended-release tablets (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of any orthostatic hypotension at any time during the trial was 38% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 31% for placebo for mild-to-moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), 63% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 58% for placebo for mild-to-moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=10 mm Hg), 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>=20 mm Hg), and 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for mild to moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>=40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>=20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of ropinirole extended-release tablets on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>=40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>=15 beats/minute), and 19% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. <1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>=30 beats/minute), and 24% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>=15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Hallucination led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole . Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3). 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease dyskinesia was reported as an adverse event in 13% of patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets and 3% of patients on placebo [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.7 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole extended-release tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. 5.8 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets as a prophylactic measure [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2)]. 5.9 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole extended-release tablets. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding).

This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with ropinirole extended-release tablets (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). The increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the advanced Parkinson's disease trial and changes related to ropinirole extended-release tablets (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of orthostatic hypotension at any time during the trial was 38% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 31% for placebo for mild-to-moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg), 63% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 58% for placebo for mild-to-moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg), 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg), and 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for mild-to-moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of ropinirole extended-release tablets on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (greater than or equal to 15 beats/minute), and 19% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (greater than or equal to 15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. less than 1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (greater than or equal to 30 beats/minute), and 24% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (greater than or equal to 15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial, 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hallucinations led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease dyskinesia was reported as an adverse event in 13% of patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets and 3% of patients on placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.7 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole extended-release tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. 5.8 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.9 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole extended-release tablets. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur (5.1) -Syncope may occur (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur (5.3) -Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate may occur (5.4) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors (5.5) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.6) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors (5.7) 5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than one year after initiation of treatment. Among the 613 patients who received ropinirole extended-release in clinical trials, there were five cases of sudden onset of sleep and two cases of motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor. During the 6-month trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 7% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release compared with 4% of patients receiving placebo. During the 36-week trial in early Parkinson's disease, somnolence was reported in 11% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release compared with 15% of patients receiving the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. However, because dose-response was not systematically studied with ropinirole extended-release, the occurrence of somnolence at the highest recommended doses may be higher than these reported frequencies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole extended-release, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole extended-release such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole extended-release should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole extended-release, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole extended-release in Parkinson's disease patients. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, syncope occurred in 2 of the 202 patients (1%) who received ropinirole extended-release and in none of the 191 patients who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because the trial of ropinirole extended-release excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. In a placebo-controlled trial involving patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 of 202 patients (2%) receiving ropinirole extended-release and in none of the 191 patients receiving placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5% of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release and in 1% of placebo recipients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. An analysis of the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease was conducted using a variety of adverse event terms possibly suggestive of hypotension, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, and blood pressure decreased. This analysis showed a higher incidence of these events with ropinirole extended-release (7%, 15 of 202) vs. placebo (3%, 6 of 191). This increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. Orthostatic vital signs (semi-supine to standing) were monitored throughout the advanced Parkinson's disease trial and changes related to ropinirole extended-release (compared with placebo) from baseline were assessed. The frequency of orthostatic hypotension at any time during the trial was 38% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 31% for placebo for mild-to-moderate systolic blood pressure decrements (>= 20 mm Hg), 63% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 58% for placebo for mild-to-moderate diastolic blood pressure decrements (>= 10 mm Hg), 10% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 7% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrements (>= 20 mm Hg), and 23% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 19% for placebo for mild-to-moderate combined systolic and diastolic blood pressure decrements. Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 10% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 8% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure decrease (>= 40 mm Hg), and was 25% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 21% for placebo for severe diastolic blood pressure decrease (>= 20 mm Hg). The increased incidence for hypotension and/or orthostatic hypotension was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases and in some cases persisted into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. 5.4 Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate In the placebo-controlled trial in advanced Parkinson's disease, there were no clear effects of ropinirole extended-release on average changes in blood pressure or heart rate compared with placebo. In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 8% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 5% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>= 40 mm Hg). In the standing position, the frequency was 9% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 6% for placebo for severe systolic blood pressure increase (>= 40 mm Hg). In the semi-supine position, the frequency was 23% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 18% for placebo for moderate pulse increase (>= 15 beats/minute), and 19% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 17% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>= 15 beats/minute). In the standing position, the frequency was 2% for ropinirole extended-release vs. < 1% for placebo for severe pulse increase (>= 30 beats/minute), and 24% for ropinirole extended-release vs. 19% for placebo for moderate pulse decrease (>= 15 beats/minute). The increased incidence for various elevations of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and/or changes in pulse was observed in both the titration and maintenance phases as well as persisting into the maintenance period after developing in the titration phase. Elevation of blood pressure and/or changes in heart rate in patients taking ropinirole extended-release should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease. 5.5 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, advanced Parkinson's disease trial, 8% (17 of 202) of patients receiving ropinirole extended-release reported hallucination compared with 2% (4 of 191) patients receiving placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hallucinations led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% (4 of 202) of patients on ropinirole extended-release and 1% (2 of 191) of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination is increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with ropinirole extended-release [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.6 Dyskinesia Ropinirole extended-release may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease dyskinesia was reported as an adverse event in 13% of patients taking ropinirole extended-release and 3% of patients on placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.7 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole extended-release, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole extended-release. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole extended-release. 5.8 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.9 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2 to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), one patient treated with ropinirole extended-release and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole extended-release. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), two patients treated with ropinirole extended-release had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 24 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3 month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1 year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur (5.1) -Syncope may occur (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur (5.3) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors (5.4) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.5) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors (5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with REQUIP have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on REQUIP, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving REQUIP and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% REQUIP, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% REQUIP, 6% placebo)[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with REQUIP, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with REQUIP such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), REQUIP should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. If a decision is made to continue REQUIP, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving REQUIP than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: REQUIP 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: REQUIP 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with REQUIP for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with REQUIP, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of REQUIP excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of REQUIP. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with REQUIP compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with REQUIP. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with REQUIP and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with REQUIP compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving REQUIP experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving REQUIP and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of REQUIP with healthy volunteers who received single doses on morethan one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving REQUIP and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving REQUIP than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: REQUIP 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: REQUIP 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: REQUIP 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of REQUIP was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with REQUIP reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both REQUIP and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release REQUIP [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with REQUIP or after starting or increasing the dose of REQUIP. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with REQUIP because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of REQUIP [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia REQUIP may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with REQUIP than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both REQUIP and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spendmoney, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including REQUIP, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REQUIP. Physiciansshould consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking REQUIP. 5.7 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with REQUIP for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using REQUIP for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of REQUIP should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days"$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur (5.1) -Syncope may occur (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur (5.3) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors (5.4) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.5) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors (5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% ropinirole, 6% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of ropinirole excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-Like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Ropinirole may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole. 5.7 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy.

Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-Morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound.

Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% ropinirole, 6% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of ropinirole excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1 mg dose of ropinirole. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, one subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Ropinirole may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole. 5.7 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3 month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1 year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$

Because the trials of ropinirole hydrochloride excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole hydrochloride. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation.

In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole hydrochloride and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole hydrochloride than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole hydrochloride 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole hydrochloride 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole hydrochloride 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole hydrochloride was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole hydrochloride and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2\\302\\255- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole hydrochloride for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole hydrochloride should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot- derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding).

There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole hydrochloride than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole hydrochloride 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole hydrochloride 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole hydrochloride, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of ropinirole hydrochloride excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole hydrochloride and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole hydrochloride compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole hydrochloride experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole hydrochloride and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole hydrochloride with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole hydrochloride and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole hydrochloride than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole hydrochloride 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole hydrochloride 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole hydrochloride 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole hydrochloride was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole hydrochloride and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole hydrochloride because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Ropinirole hydrochloride may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole hydrochloride and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole hydrochloride, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole hydrochloride. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole hydrochloride. 5.7 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole hydrochloride for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole hydrochloride should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Sudden onset of sleep and somnolence may occur (5.1) -Syncope may occur (5.2) -Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension may occur (5.3) -May cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behaviors (5.4) -May cause or exacerbate dyskinesia (5.5) -May cause problems with impulse control or compulsive behaviors (5.6) 5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients treated with ropinirole tablets have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Before initiating treatment with ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole tablets such as concomitant sedating medications, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole tablets should ordinarily be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. 5.2 Syncope Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole tablets 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole tablets 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. Because the trials of ropinirole tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson's disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole tablets. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. 5.3 Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension Dopamine agonists in clinical trials and clinical experience appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In addition, patients with Parkinson's disease appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and patients should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole tablets. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole tablets experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole tablets and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole tablets with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson's disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa: ropinirole tablets 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson's disease: ropinirole tablets 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole tablets 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole tablets was 4% in patients with early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and 1% in patients with RLS. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] 5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole tablets reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole tablets or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole tablets. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.5 Dyskinesia Ropinirole tablets may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of L-dopa and may cause and/or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of the dopaminergic drug may ameliorate this adverse reaction. 5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors Case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and RLS. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole tablets. 5.7 Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole tablets for Parkinson's disease as a prophylactic measure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.8 Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole tablets for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). 5.9 Augmentation and Early-morning Rebound in Restless Legs Syndrome Reports in the literature indicate treatment of RLS with dopaminergic medications can result in recurrence of symptoms in the early morning hours, referred to as rebound. Augmentation has also been described during therapy for RLS. Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole tablets should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. 5.10 Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded. 5.11 Retinal Pathology Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested (equivalent to 0.6 to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] for Parkinson's disease [24 mg/day] on a mg/m2 basis), but was statistically significant at the highest dose (50 mg/kg/day). Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3 month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1 year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial. 5.12 Binding to Melanin Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days."$$
"6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5% and greater than placebo) in advanced Parkinson's disease with concomitant L-dopa were dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, abdominal pain/discomfort, and orthostatic hypotension. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=5%) in early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa were nausea, somnolence, abdominal pain/discomfort, dizziness, headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following adverse reactions are described in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: Falling asleep during activities of daily living (5.1) Syncope (5.2) Symptomatic hypotension, hypotension, postural/orthostatic hypotension (5.3) Elevation of blood pressure and changes in heart rate (5.4) Hallucination (5.5) Dyskinesia (5.6) Major psychotic disorders (5.7) Events with dopaminergic therapy (5.8) Retinal pathology (5.9) 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During the premarketing development of Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets without L-dopa. Advanced Parkinson's Disease (With L-dopa) The most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=5% and numerically greater than placebo) in the 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease during treatment with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets were, in order of decreasing incidence: dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, abdominal pain/discomfort, and orthostatic hypotension. Approximately 6% of 202 patients treated with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse event(s) compared with 5% of 191 patients who received placebo. The adverse event most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablet was hallucination (2%). Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% (and were numerically greater than placebo) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets who participated in the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In this study, either Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa. Adverse reactions were generally mild or moderate in intensity. Table 2.

The incidence for many adverse reactions with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets treatment was increased relative to placebo (i.e., Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets % - Placebo % = treatment difference >=2%) in either the titration or maintenance phases of the study. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of % treatment difference) was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, abdominal pain/discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, peripheral edema, and dry mouth. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, fall, hypertension, abnormal dreams, constipation, chest pain, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These \\\\"persistent\\\\" adverse reactions included dyskinesia, hallucination, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth. The incidence of adverse reactions was not clearly different between women and men. Early Parkinson's Disease (Without L-dopa) The most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=5%) in the 36-week early Parkinson's disease trial during treatment with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets were, in order of decreasing incidence: nausea (19%), somnolence (11%), abdominal pain/discomfort (7%), dizziness (6%), headache (6%), and constipation (5%). The type of adverse reactions and the frequency (i.e. incidence) with which they occurred were generally similar over the whole treatment period in this study of early Parkinson's disease patients who were initially treated with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and subsequently crossed over to treatment with the other formulation. During the titration phase, an increased incidence with Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets compared with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets (i.e., Ropinirole Extended-release Tablets % - immediate-release ropinirole tablets % = treatment difference >=2%), shown in descending order of % treatment difference, was observed for: constipation, hallucination, vertigo, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fall, headache, diarrhea, pyrexia, and flatulence. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for fall, myalgia, and sleep disorder. Several adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These \\\\"persistent\\\\" adverse reactions included: constipation, hallucination, muscle spasms, flatulence, insomnia, sleep disorder, abdominal pain/discomfort, cough, and nasopharyngitis. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Development of the Immediate-Release Formulation of Ropinirole Tablets for Parkinson's Disease (Advanced and Early) Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets the most common adverse reactions (>=5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were dyskinesia (21%), somnolence (12%), nausea (12%), dizziness (10%), confusion (7%), hallucinations (6%), headache (5%), and increased sweating (5%). In patients with early Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>=5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were nausea (38%), somnolence (34%), dizziness (18%), syncope (11%), viral infection (8%), fatigue (7%), leg edema (6%), asthenia (5%), and dyspepsia (5%)."$$
"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence with ropinirole at least 5% greater than placebo) in the respective indications were: -Early PD: Nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition, viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia (6.1) -Advanced PD: Dyskinesia, somnolence, nausea, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, sweating, and headache (6.1) -RLS: Nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, and asthenic condition (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Roxane Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the label: -Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)] -Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] -Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] -Withdrawal-emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] -Melanoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] -Augmentation and Early-morning rebound in RLS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] -Fibrotic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of ropinirole, patients received ropinirole either without L-dopa (early Parkinson's disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinson's disease trials). Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these two populations separately. Early Parkinson's Disease (Without L-dopa) In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia. Approximately 24% of patients treated with ropinirole who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness. Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients.

During the premarketing development of ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets without L-dopa. Advanced Parkinson's Disease (with L-dopa) In the 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets(incidence at least 5% greater than placebo)were dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness and hallucination. Approximately 6% of patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 5% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated withropinirole extended-release tabletscausing discontinuation of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tabletswas hallucination (2%) Table 2 lists treatment-emergentadverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% (and were numerically greater than placebo) of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with ropinirole extended-release tabletswho participated in the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Although this trial was not designed for optimally characterizing dose-related adverse reactions, there was a suggestion (based upon comparison of incidence of adverse reactions across dose ranges for ropinirole extended-release tablets and placebo) that the incidence for dyskinesia, hypertension, and fall was dose-related to ropinirole extended-release tablets. The incidence for many adverse reactions with ropinirole extended-release tablets treatment was increased relative to placebo (i.e., the incidence in the group receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets was 2% or greater than placebo in either the titration or maintenance phases of the trial. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of % treatment difference) was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, abdominal pain/discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, peripheral edema, and dry mouth. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, fall, hypertension, abnormal dreams, constipation, chest pain, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (\\302\\2637 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included dyskinesia, hallucination, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth. The incidence of adverse reactions was not clearly different between women and men. Early Parkinson's Disease (without L-dopa) In the 36-week early Parkinson's disease trial the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets(>=5%) were nausea (19%), somnolence (11%), abdominal pain/discomfort (7%), dizziness (6%), headache (6%), and constipation (5%). The type of adverse reactions and the frequency (i.e. incidence) with which they occurred were generally similar over the whole treatment period in this trial of early Parkinson's disease patients who were initially treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and subsequently crossed over to treatment with the other formulation. During the titration phase, an increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets (i.e., the incidence inropinirole extended-release tablets was 2% or greater than immediate-releaseropinirole tablets), shown in descending order of % treatment difference, was observed for: constipation, hallucination, vertigo, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fall, headache, diarrhea, pyrexia, and flatulence. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for fall, myalgia, and sleep disorder. Several adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (\\302\\2637 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included: constipation, hallucination, muscle spasms, flatulence, insomnia, sleep disorder, abdominal pain/discomfort, cough, and nasopharyngitis. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Observed during the Clinical Development of the Immediate-release Formulation of Ropinirole Tablets for Parkinson's Disease (Advanced and Early) Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (\\302\\2635% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were dyskinesia (21%), somnolence (12%), nausea (12%), dizziness (10%), confusion (7%), hallucinations (6%), headache (5%), and increased sweating (5%). In patients with early Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (\\302\\2635% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were nausea (38%), somnolence (34%), dizziness (18%), syncope (11%), asthenic condition (11%),viral infection (8%), leg edema (6%), vomiting (5%),and dyspepsia (5%)."$$

During the premarketing development of ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole without L-dopa. Advanced Parkinson's Disease (With L-dopa) In the 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets (incidence at least 5% greeater than placebo) were dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, and hallucination. Approximately 6% of patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 5% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets causing discontinuation of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets was hallucination (2%). Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% (and were numerically greater than placebo) of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets who participated in the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, either ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa. Table 2.

Although this trial was not designed for optimally characterizing dose-related adverse reactions, there was a suggestion (based upon comparison of incidence of adverse reactions across dose ranges for ropinirole extended-release tablets and placebo) that the incidence for dyskinesia, hypertension, and fall was dose-related to ropinirole extended-release tablets. The incidence for many adverse reactions with ropinirole extended-release tablet treatment was increased relative to placebo (i.e., the incidence in the group receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets was 2% or greater than placebo) in either the titration or maintenance phases of the trial. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of % treatment difference) was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, abdominal pain/discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, peripheral edema, and dry mouth. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, fall, hypertension, abnormal dreams, constipation, chest pain, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis.

These "persistent" adverse reactions included constipation, hallucination, muscle spasms, flatulence, insomnia, sleep disorder, abdominal pain/discomfort, cough, and nasopharyngitis. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Observed during the Clinical Development of the Immediate-Release Formulation of Ropinirole Tablets for Parkinson's Disease (Advanced and Early) Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were dyskinesia (21%), somnolence (12%), nausea (12%), dizziness (10%), confusion (7%), hallucinations (6%), headache (5%), and increased sweating (5%). In patients with early Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were nausea (38%), somnolence (34%), dizziness (18%), syncope (11%), asthenic condition (11%), viral infection (8%), leg edema (6%), vomiting (5%), and dyspepsia (5%)."$$

During the premarketing development of ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets without L-dopa. Advanced Parkinson's Disease (with L-dopa) In the 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, and hallucination. Approximately 6% of patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 5% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets causing discontinuation of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets was hallucination (2%). Table 2 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% (and were numerically greater than placebo) of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets who participated in the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, either ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L -dopa. Table 2.

Although this trial was not designed for optimally characterizing dose-related adverse reactions, there was a suggestion (based upon comparison of incidence of adverse reactions across dose ranges for ropinirole extended-release tablets and placebo) that the incidence for dyskinesia, hypertension, and fall was dose-related to ropinirole extended-release tablets. The incidence for many adverse reactions with ropinirole extended-release tablets treatment was increased relative to placebo (i.e., the incidence in the group receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets was 2% or greater than placebo) in either the titration or maintenance phases of the trial. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of % treatment difference) was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, abdominal pain/ discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, peripheral edema, and dry mouth. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, fall, hypertension, abnormal dreams, constipation, chest pain, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included dyskinesia, hallucination, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth. The incidence of adverse reactions was not clearly different between women and men. Early Parkinson's Disease (Without L -dopa) In the 36-week early Parkinson's disease trial, the most commonly observed adverse reactions inpatients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets (>=5%) were nausea (19%), somnolence (11%), abdominal pain/discomfort (7%), dizziness (6%), headache (6%), and constipation (5%). The type of adverse reactions and the frequency (i.e., incidence) with which they occurred were generally similar over the whole treatment period in this trial of early Parkinson's disease patients who were initially treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and subsequently crossed over to treatment with the other formulation. During the titration phase, an increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablet (i.e., the incidence in ropinirole extended-release tablets was 2% or greater than immediate-release ropinirole tablet) shown in descending order of % treatment difference, was observed for constipation, hallucination, vertigo, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fall, headache, diarrhea, pyrexia, and flatulence. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for fall, myalgia, and sleep disorder. Several adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included constipation, hallucination, muscle spasms, flatulence, insomnia, sleep disorder, abdominal pain/discomfort, cough, and nasopharyngitis. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Observed during the Clinical Development of the Immediate-release Formulation of R opinirole for Parkinson's Disease (Advanced and Early) Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Parkinson's Disease During the premarketing development of REQUIP, patients received REQUIP either without L-dopa (early Parkinson's disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinson's disease trials). Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these two populations separately. Early Parkinson's Disease (without L-dopa) In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia. Approximately 24% of patients treated with REQUIP who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness. Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with REQUIP participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients.

Approximately 24% of patients who received REQUIP in the double-blind, placebo-controlled advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 18% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with REQUIP (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was dizziness.

Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa. Table 4.

(6.1) Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=5%) in early Parkinson's disease without L-dopa were nausea, somnolence, abdominal pain/ discomfort, dizziness, headache, and constipation.

During the premarketing development of ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole without L-dopa. Advanced Parkinson's Disease (With L-dopa): The most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=5% and numerically greater than placebo) in the 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease during treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets were, in order of decreasing incidence: dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, abdominal pain/discomfort, and orthostatic hypotension. Approximately 6% of 202 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse event(s) compared with 5% of 191 patients who received placebo. The adverse event most commonly causing discontinuation of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets was hallucination (2%). Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of at least 2% (and were numerically greater than placebo) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets who participated in the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In this study, either ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa. Adverse reactions were generally mild or moderate in intensity. Table 2.

The incidence for many adverse reactions with treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets was increased relative to placebo (i.e., ropinirole extended-release tablets % \\302\\255- placebo % = treatment difference >=2%) in either the titration or maintenance phases of the study. During the titration phase, an increased incidence (shown in descending order of % treatment difference) was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, abdominal pain/discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, vertigo, hypertension, peripheral edema, and dry mouth. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucination, somnolence, fall, hypertension, abnormal dreams, constipation, chest pain, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis. Some adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included dyskinesia, hallucination, orthostatic hypotension, and dry mouth. The incidence of adverse reactions was not clearly different between women and men. Early Parkinson's Disease (Without L-dopa): The most commonly observed adverse reactions (>=5%) in the 36-week early Parkinson's disease trial during treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets were, in order of decreasing incidence: nausea (19%), somnolence (11%), abdominal pain/discomfort (7%), dizziness (6%), headache (6%), and constipation (5%). The type of adverse reactions and the frequency (i.e. incidence) with which they occurred were generally similar over the whole treatment period in this study of early Parkinson's disease patients who were initially treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole and subsequently crossed over to treatment with the other formulation. During the titration phase, an increased incidence with ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole (i.e., ropinirole extended-release formulation % - ropinirole immediate-release formulation % = treatment difference >=2%), shown in descending order of % treatment difference, was observed for: constipation, hallucination, vertigo, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fall, headache, diarrhea, pyrexia, and flatulence. During the maintenance phase, an increased incidence was observed for fall, myalgia, and sleep disorder. Several adverse reactions developing in the titration phase persisted (>=7 days) into the maintenance phase. These "persistent" adverse reactions included: constipation, hallucination, muscle spasms, flatulence, insomnia, sleep disorder, abdominal pain/discomfort, cough, and nasopharyngitis. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Development of the Immediate-Release Formulation of Ropinirole for Parkinson's Disease (Advanced and Early) Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>=5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were dyskinesia (21%), somnolence (12%), nausea (12%), dizziness (10%), confusion (7%), hallucinations (6%), headache (5%), and increased sweating (5%). In patients with early Parkinson's disease who were treated with the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>=5% treatment difference from placebo; presented in order of decreasing treatment difference frequency) were nausea (38%), somnolence (34%), dizziness (18%), syncope (11%), viral infection (8%), fatigue (7%), leg edema (6%), asthenia (5%), and dyspepsia (5%)."$$

There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole tablets, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole tablets may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases the AUC and Cmax of ropinirole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Estrogens Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) reduced the clearance of ropinirole. Starting or stopping HRT may require adjustment of dosage of ropinirole tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Dopamine Antagonists Because ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may reduce the efficacy of ropinirole tablets."$$

(7.4) 7.1 P450 Interaction In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, with immediate-release ropinirole tablets increased the AUC of ropinirole by 84% on average and Cmax by 60% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking. In one study in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, cigarette smokers had an approximate 30% lower Cmax and a 38% lower AUC than did nonsmokers, when those parameters were normalized for dose. There is no evidence of interaction between ropinirole and other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline). Ropinirole and its circulating metabolites do not inhibit or induce P450 enzymes therefore ropinirole is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs by a P450 mechanism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 L-dopa Coadministration of carbidopa + L-dopa (SINEMET(R)*) with immediate-release ropinirole tablets had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ropinirole. Oral administration of immediate-release ropinirole tablets increased mean steady-state Cmax of L-dopa by 20%, but its AUC was unaffected [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Estrogens Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) reduced the oral clearance of ropinirole by approximately 35%. Dosage adjustment is not needed for initiating ropinirole extended-release tablets in patients on estrogen therapy because patients are individually titrated with ropinirole extended-release tablets to tolerance or adequate effect. If estrogen therapy is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, then adjustment of the dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets may be required. 7.4 Dopamine Antagonists Since ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may diminish the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets. Patients with a history or presence of major psychotic disorders should be treated with dopamine agonists only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks."$$

(7.4) 7.1 P450 Interaction In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, with immediate-release ropinirole increased the AUC of ropinirole by 84% on average and Cmax by 60% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking. In one study in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, cigarette smokers had an approximate 30% lower Cmax and a 38% lower AUC than did nonsmokers, when those parameters were normalized for dose. There is no evidence of interaction between ropinirole and other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline). Ropinirole and its circulating metabolites do not inhibit or induce P450 enzymes therefore ropinirole is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs by a P450 mechanism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 L-dopa Coadministration of carbidopa + L-dopa (SINEMET(R)*) with immediate-release ropinirole had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ropinirole. Oral administration of immediate-release ropinirole increased mean steady-state Cmax of L-dopa by 20%, but its AUC was unaffected [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Estrogens Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) reduced the oral clearance of ropinirole by approximately 35%. Dosage adjustment is not needed for initiating ropinirole extended-release tablets in patients on estrogen therapy because patients are individually titrated with ropinirole extended-release tablets to tolerance or adequate effect. If estrogen therapy is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, then adjustment of the dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets may be required. 7.4 Dopamine Antagonists Since ropinirole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may diminish the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets. Patients with a history or presence of major psychotic disorders should be treated with dopamine agonists only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks."$$
