"Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with androgens: Anticoagulants, oral C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirement. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring especially when androgens are started or stopped. Antidiabetic drugs and insulin In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements. ACTH and corticosteroids Enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease. Oxyphenbutazone May result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone."$$
