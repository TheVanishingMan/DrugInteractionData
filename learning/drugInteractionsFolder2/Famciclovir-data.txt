The most common adverse events reported in at least 1 indication by >10% of adult patients treated with famciclovir tablets are headache and nausea. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Immunocompetent patients: The safety of famciclovir tablets has been evaluated in active-and placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 163 famciclovir tablets -treated patients with recurrent genital herpes (famciclovir tablets, 1000 mg twice daily); 1,197 patients with recurrent genital herpes treated with famciclovir tablets as suppressive therapy (125 mg once daily to 250 mg three times daily) of which 570 patients received famciclovir tablets (open-labeled and/or double-blind) for at least 10 months; and 447 famciclovir tablets -treated patients with herpes labialis (famciclovir tablets, 1500 mg once daily or 750 mg twice daily).

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Probenecid: May increase penciclovir levels. Monitor for evidence of penciclovir toxicity (7.2) 7.1 Potential for Famciclovir Tablets to Affect Other Drugs The steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin were not altered by concomitant administration of multiple doses of famciclovir (500 mg three times daily). No clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, its metabolite zidovudine glucuronide, or emtricitabine was observed following a single oral dose of 500 mg famciclovir coadministered with zidovudine or emtricitabine. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes suggests that famciclovir is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Penciclovir No clinically significant alterations in penciclovir pharmacokinetics were observed following single-dose administration of 500 mg famciclovir after pre-treatment with multiple doses of allopurinol, cimetidine, theophylline, zidovudine, promethazine, when given shortly after an antacid (magnesium and aluminum hydroxide), or concomitantly with emtricitabine. No clinically significant effect on penciclovir pharmacokinetics was observed following multiple-dose (three times daily) administration of famciclovir (500 mg) with multiple doses of digoxin. Concurrent use with probenecid or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of penciclovir. The conversion of 6-deoxy penciclovir to penciclovir is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme and/or inhibiting this enzyme could potentially occur. Clinical interaction studies of famciclovir with cimetidine and promethazine, in vitro inhibitors of aldehyde oxidase, did not show relevant effects on the formation of penciclovir. Raloxifene, a potent aldehyde oxidase inhibitor in vitro, could decrease the formation of penciclovir. However, a clinical drug-drug interaction study to determine the magnitude of interaction between penciclovir and raloxifene has not been conducted."$$
