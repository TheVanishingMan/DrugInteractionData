(5.14, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Hypertension In Study 1 in DTC, hypertension was reported in 73% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 16% of patients in the placebo group [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The median time to onset of new or worsening hypertension was 16 days for LENVIMA-treated patients. The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was 44% as compared to 4% for placebo, and the incidence of Grade 4 hypertension was less than 1% in LENVIMA-treated patients and none in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, hypertension was reported in 42% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 10% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. The median time to onset of new or worsening hypertension was 35 days for LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients. The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was 13% in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group as compared to 2% in the everolimus-treated group. Systolic blood pressure >= 160mmHg occurred in 29% and 21% of patients had a diastolic blood pressure >=100 in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with LENVIMA. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment with LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy; resume at a reduced dose when hypertension is controlled at less than or equal to Grade 2. Discontinue LENVIMA for life-threatening hypertension [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Dysfunction In Study 1 in DTC, cardiac dysfunction, defined as decreased left or right ventricular function, cardiac failure, or pulmonary edema, was reported in 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients (2% Grade 3 or greater) and 2% (no Grade 3 or greater) of patients in the placebo group. The majority of these cases in LENVIMA-treated patients (14 of 17 cases) were based on findings of decreased ejection fraction as assessed by echocardiography. Six of 261 (2%) LENVIMA-treated patients in Study 1 had greater than 20% reduction in ejection fraction as measured by echocardiography compared to no patients who received placebo. In Study 2 in RCC, decreased ejection fraction and cardiac failure were reported in 10% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 6% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. Grade 3 events occurred in 3% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients and 2% of everolimus-treated patients. In the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group there were two patients with a Grade 2 to 4 decrease in LVEF as assessed by MUGA. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac decompensation. Withhold LENVIMA for development of Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction until improved to Grade 0 or 1 or baseline. Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue LENVIMA depending on the severity and persistence of cardiac dysfunction. Discontinue LENVIMA for Grade 4 cardiac dysfunction [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In Study 1 in DTC, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events of Grade 3 or greater was 3% in LENVIMA-treated patients and 1% in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, 2% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 6% of patients in the everolimus-treated group had arterial thromboembolic events reported. The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events of Grade 3 or greater was 2% with LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients and 4% in the everolimus-treated group. Discontinue LENVIMA following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming LENVIMA after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Across clinical studies in which 1160 patients received LENVIMA monotherapy, hepatic failure (including fatal events) was reported in 3 patients and acute hepatitis was reported in 1 patient. In Study 1 in DTC, 4% of LENVIMA-treated patients experienced an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 5% experienced an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that was Grade 3 or greater. No patients in the placebo group experienced Grade 3 or greater increases in ALT or AST. The incidence of ALT and AST elevation was similar in Study 2 in RCC. In Study 2, 3% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients experienced an increase in ALT and 3% experienced an increase in AST that was Grade 3 or greater. Two percent of patients in the everolimus-treated group experienced an increase in ALT and none experienced an increase in AST that was Grade 3 or greater. Monitor liver function before initiation of LENVIMA, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold LENVIMA for the development of Grade 3 or greater liver impairment until resolved to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline. Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue LENVIMA depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue LENVIMA for hepatic failure [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.5 Proteinuria In Study 1 in DTC, proteinuria was reported in 34% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 3% of patients in the placebo group [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The incidence of Grade 3 proteinuria in LENVIMA-treated patients was 11% compared to none in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, proteinuria was reported in 31% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 14% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 proteinuria in LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients was 8% compared to 2% in everolimus-treated patients. Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria greater than or equal to 2+ is detected, obtain a 24 hour urine protein. Withhold LENVIMA for >=2 grams of proteinuria/24 hours and resume at a reduced dose when proteinuria is <2 gm/24 hours. Discontinue LENVIMA for nephrotic syndrome [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5 .6 Diarrhea In Study 2 in RCC, diarrhea was reported in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients and 34% of everolimus-treated patients. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 19% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients and 2% of everolimus-treated patients. Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction and recurred despite dose reduction. Diarrhea resulted in discontinuation in one patient [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Initiate prompt medical management for the development of diarrhea. Monitor for dehydration. Interrupt LENVIMA for Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea. For Grade 3 diarrhea, resume at a reduced dose of LENVIMA when diarrhea resolves to Grade 1 or baseline. Permanently discontinue LENVIMA for Grade 4 diarrhea despite medical management. 5.7 Renal Failure and Impairment In Study 1 in DTC, events of renal impairment were reported in 14% of LENVIMA-treated patients compared to 2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of Grade 3 or greater renal failure or impairment was 3% in LENVIMA-treated patients and 1% in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, renal impairment was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 12% in the everolimus-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 or greater renal failure or impairment was 10% in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 2% in the everolimus-treated group. One risk factor for severe renal impairment in LENVIMA-treated patients was dehydration/hypovolemia due to diarrhea and vomiting. Active management of diarrhea and any other gastrointestinal symptoms should be initiated for Grade 1 events. Withhold LENVIMA for development of Grade 3 or 4 renal failure/impairment until resolved to Grade 0 to 1 or baseline. Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue LENVIMA depending on the severity and persistence of renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5. 8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation In Study 1 in DTC, events of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula were reported in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 0.8% of patients in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, Grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal perforation, abscess or fistula was reported in 2% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and no patients in the everolimus-treated group. The events resolved in all patients. Discontinue LENVIMA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or life-threatening fistula [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5. 9 QT Interval Prolongation In Study 1 in DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation was reported in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of QT interval prolongation of greater than 500 ms was 2% in LENVIMA-treated patients compared to no reports in the placebo group. In Study 2 in RCC, QTc interval increases greater than 60 ms were reported in 11% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group. The incidence of QTc interval greater than 500 ms was 6% in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group. No reports of QTc interval prolongation greater than 500 ms or increase greater than 60 ms occurred in the everolimus-treated group. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities in all patients. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold LENVIMA for the development of QTc interval prolongation greater than 500 ms. Resume LENVIMA at a reduced dose when QTc prolongation resolves to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5. 10 Hypocalcemia In Study 1 in DTC, 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients experienced Grade 3 or greater hypocalcemia compared to 2% in the placebo group. In most cases hypocalcemia responded to replacement and dose interruption/dose reduction. In Study 2 in RCC, 6% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 2% of patients in the everolimus-treated group experienced Grade 3 or greater hypocalcemia. No patients discontinued due to hypocalcemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during LENVIMA treatment. Interrupt and adjust LENVIMA dosing as necessary depending on severity, presence of ECG changes, and persistence of hypocalcemia [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.1 1 Reversible Posterior Leukoe ncephalopathy Syndrome Across clinical studies in which 1160 patients received LENVIMA monotherapy, there were 4 reported events of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold for RPLS until fully resolved. Upon resolution, resume at a reduced dose or discontinue LENVIMA depending on the severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.1 2 Hemorrhagic E vents Across clinical studies in which 1160 patients received LENVIMA monotherapy, Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage was reported in 2% of patients. In Study 1 in DTC, hemorrhagic events occurred in 35% of LENVIMA-treated patients and in 18% of the placebo group. However, the incidence of Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage was similar between arms at 2% and 3%, respectively. There was 1 case of fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (11% Grade 1 and 1% Grade 2). Discontinuation due to hemorrhagic events occurred in 1% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In Study 2 in RCC, hemorrhagic events occurred in 34% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 26% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis (LENVIMA + everolimus 23% and everolimus 24%). Grade 3 or greater events occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients and in 2% of everolimus-treated patients. In the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients, this included one fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Discontinuation due to a hemorrhagic event occurred in 3% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group. Serious tumor related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events in LENVIMA-treated patients, have occurred in clinical trials and been reported in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in other tumor types. The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery). Withhold LENVIMA for the development of Grade 3 hemorrhage until resolved to Grade 0 to 1. Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue LENVIMA depending on the severity and persistence of hemorrhage. Discontinue LENVIMA in patients who experience Grade 4 hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.1 3 Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression /Thyroid Dysfunction LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In Study 1 in DTC, 88% of all patients had a baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level less than or equal to 0.5 mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level above 0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients as compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. In Study 2 in RCC, Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 2% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. In those patients with a normal or low TSH at baseline, an elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 60 % of LENVIMA + everolimus-treated patients as compared with 3% of patients receiving everolimus monotherapy. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and at least monthly throughout, treatment with LENVIMA. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice to maintain a euthyroid state. 5.1 4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 2 weeks following completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ]."$$

The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to LENVIMA as a single agent in 261 DTC patients (Study 1) and LENVIMA + everolimus in 62 RCC patients (Study 2). Safety data obtained in 1160 patients with advanced solid tumors who received LENVIMA as a single agent across multiple clinical studies was used to further characterize the risks of serious adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 , 5.10 , 5.11 ) ]. In the entire single agent population, the median age was 60 years (range 21-89 years), the dose range was 0.2 mg to 32 mg, and the median duration of exposure was 5.5 months. Differentiated Thyroid Cance r The safety data described below are derived from Study 1 which randomized (2:1) patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-refractory DTC) to LENVIMA (n=261) or placebo (n=131) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The median treatment duration was 16.1 months for LENVIMA and 3.9 months for placebo. Among 261 patients who received LENVIMA in Study 1, median age was 64 years, 52% were women, 80% were White, 18% were Asian, and 2% were Black; 4% identified themselves as having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. In Study 1, the most common adverse reactions observed in LENVIMA-treated patients (greater than or equal to 30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, weight decreased, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysphonia. The most common serious adverse reactions (at least 2%) were pneumonia (4%), hypertension (3%), and dehydration (3%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68% of patients receiving LENVIMA and 5% of patients receiving placebo; 18% of patients discontinued LENVIMA and 5% discontinued placebo for adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) resulting in dose reductions of LENVIMA were hypertension (13%), proteinuria (11%), decreased appetite (10%), and diarrhea (10%); the most common adverse reactions (at least 1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were hypertension (1%) and asthenia (1%). Table 4 presents the percentage of patients in Study 1 experiencing adverse reactions at a higher rate in LENVIMA-treated patients than patients receiving placebo in the double-blind phase of the DTC study.

Renal Cell Carcinoma The data described below are derived from Study 2 which randomized (1:1:1) patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to LENVIMA 18 mg + everolimus 5 mg (n=51), LENVIMA 24 mg (n=52), or everolimus 10 mg (n=50) once daily [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. This data also includes patients on the dose escalation portion of the study who received LENVIMA 18 mg + everolimus 5 mg (n=11). The median treatment duration was 8.1 months for LENVIMA + everolimus and 4.1 months for everolimus. Among 62 patients who received LENVIMA + everolimus in Study 2, the median age was 61 years, 71% were men, and 98% were White. The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group (> 30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, diarrhea, fatigue, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis/oral inflammation, hypertension, peripheral edema, cough, abdominal pain, dyspnea, rash, weight decreased, hemorrhagic events, and proteinuria. The most common serious adverse reactions (>= 5%) were renal failure (11%), dehydration (10%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), vomiting (5%), and dyspnea (5%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions or interruption in 89% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and 54% in patients receiving everolimus. The most common adverse reactions (>= 5%) resulting in dose reductions in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group were diarrhea (21%), fatigue (8%), thrombocytopenia (6%), vomiting (6%), nausea (5%), and proteinuria (5%). Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients in the LENVIMA + everolimus-treated group and 12% of patients in the everolimus-treated group.
