"ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS, General, Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly >=65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril (N=688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=184) Incidence (Discontinuatio) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N = 1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic Hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic Gout, decreased libido.

A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8% and 7.5% in fosinopril-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a Whole Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and possibly related reactions and PRECAUTIONS, Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/ arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions, Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS, General ). Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril on growth and development have not been studied."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets has been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with hypertension; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, the usual duration of therapy was two months. Adverse clinical or laboratory events led to discontinuation of therapy by 4.3% of 368 placebo-treated patients and by 3.5% of 660 fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide treated patients. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were headache (0.3%), cough (0.3%; see PRECAUTIONS), and fatigue (0.2%). The side effects considered probably or possibly related to study drug that occurred in placebo-controlled trials in more than 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.

Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Elevations (usually transient and minor) of BUN and creatinine have been observed, but these have not been more frequent than in parallel patients treated with placebo. The hemoglobin in fosinopril-treated patients generally decreases by an average of 0.1 g/dL, but this nonprogressive change has never been symptomatic. Leukopenia and eosinophilia have also been reported. Serum levels of liver function tests (transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin) have occasionally been found to be elevated, and these elevations have lead to discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of patients. Other risk factors for liver dysfunction have often been present in these cases; in any event the elevations generally have resolved after discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril. Other Adverse Events Reported With ACE Inhibitors Other adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include cardiac arrest; pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia; aplastic anemia; thrombocytopenia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; and a syndrome that may include one or more of arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermopathy, positive ANA titer, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated ESR. Hydrochlorothiazide has now been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions.

The hemoglobin in fosinopril-treated patients generally decreases by an average of 0.1 g/dL, but this nonprogressive change has never been symptomatic. Leukopenia and eosinophilia have also been reported. Serum levels of liver function tests (transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin) have occasionally been found to be elevated, and these elevations have lead to discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of patients. Other risk factors for liver dysfunction have often been present in these cases; in any event the elevations generally have resolved after discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril. Other Adverse Events Reported with ACE Inhibitors Other adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include cardiac arrest; pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia; aplastic anemia; thrombocytopenia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; and a syndrome that may include one or more of arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermopathy, positive ANA titer, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated ESR.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with hypertension; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, the usual duration of therapy was two months.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 2 to 3 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General, Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (>=65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below.

Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General .) Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."$$

A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (>= 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4% to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular: Sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Dermatologic: pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, decreased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS, Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Diuretics). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2,100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more.

The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General, Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (>= 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium tablets alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events In Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium Tablets Placebo (N=688) (N=184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium tablets but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating.

Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3-6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium tablets was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium tablets occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium tablets and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Heart Failure) Fosinopril Sodium Tablets Placebo (N=361) (N=373) Incidence (Discontinuation) Incidence (Discontinuation) Dizziness 11.9 (0.6) 5.4 (0.3) Cough 9.7 (0.8) 5.1 (0.0) Hypotension 4.4 (0.8) 0.8 (0.0) Musculoskeletal Pain 3.3 (0.0) 2.7 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 2.2 (0.6) 1.6 (0.3) Diarrhea 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Chest Pain (non-cardiac) 2.2 (0.0) 1.6 (0.0) Upper Respiratory Infection 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Orthostatic Hypotension 1.9 (0.0) 0.8 (0.0) Subjective Cardiac Rhythm Disturbance 1.4 (0.6) 0.8 (0.3) Weakness 1.4 (0.3) 0.5 (0.0) The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium tablets but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (>= 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain.

Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, With Diuretics). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General .) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy.

"Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril Na tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics Fosinopril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril. Other Neither fosinopril nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed."$$

If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see ). With diuretics: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With lithium: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant and administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. With antacids: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium. The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. Other: In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed."$$
"Drug Interactions Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics As noted above (\\\\"Derangements of Serum Electrolytes\\\\"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.

Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide. Other The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied. By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure)compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.
