"ADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, DDAVP has produced transient headache, nausea, mild abdominal cramps and vulval pain. These symptoms disappeared with reduction in dosage. Occasionally, injection of DDAVP has produced local erythema, swelling or burning pain. Occasional facial flushing has been reported with the administration of DDAVP. DDAVP Injection has infrequently produced changes in blood pressure causing either a slight elevation or a transient fall and a compensatory increase in heart rate. Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported rarely with DDAVP Injection. See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia. Post Marketing There have been rare reports of thrombotic events (acute cerebrovascular thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction) following DDAVP Injection in patients predisposed to thrombus formation, and rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS: Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate and desmopressin acetate injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. Central Diabetes Insipidus: In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods up to 44 months of desmopressin acetate tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The only adverse event occurring in >= 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other: The following adverse events have been reported; however, their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain.

"Drug Interactions Although the pressor activity of DDAVP is very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of DDAVP Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigene and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution."$$
