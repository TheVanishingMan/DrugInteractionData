"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trails. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at IM injection site - 16% Pain at IV injection site - 3% Thrombophlebitis - 3% Phlebitis - 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic: Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry: Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal: Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis: Presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, gastritis, stomatitis, black "hairy" tongue and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections). General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Injection site reaction Immune System Disorders: Serious and fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions (See WARNINGS section) Nervous System Disorders: Convulsion. Renal and Urinary Disorders: Tubulointerstitial nephritis. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), urticaria, erythema multiforme, and exfoliative dermatitis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section)."$$

"ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients: Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at I.M. injection site - 16% Pain at I.V. injection site - 3% Thrombophlebitis - 3% Phlebitis - 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients: Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic: Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic: Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes,platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry: Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal: Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis: Presence of RBCs and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillin and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal: glositis, stamatitis, nausea, vomiting, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, and diarrhea. These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms of the drugs. Hypersensitivity Reactions: An erythematous, mildly pruritic, maculopapular skin rash has been reported fairly frequently. The rash, which usually does not develop within the first week of therapy, may cover the entire body including the soles, palms, and oral mucosa. The eruption usually disappears in three to seven days. Other hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported are: skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form of the drug NOTE: Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled by antihistamines, and if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening, and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactoid reactions require emergency measures (see WARNINGS). Liver: Moderate elevation in serum glutamic oxalaacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukapenia, and agranulacytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Other: Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the use at ampicillin are laryngeal stride and high fever. An occasional patient may complain of sore mouth or tongue as with any oral penicillin preparation."$$

A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form.

"Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin: Allopurinol - Increased possibility of skin rash; particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur. Bacteriostatic antibiotics - Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well-documented. Oral contraceptives - May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur. Probenecid - May decrease renal tubular secretion of ampicillin resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions After treatment with ampicillin, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper sulfate tests (Benedict's solution, Fehling's solution, or Clinitest(R) tablets) but not with enzyme based tests such as Clinistix(R) and Tes-Tape(R) (Glucose Enzymatic Test Strip USP)."$$
