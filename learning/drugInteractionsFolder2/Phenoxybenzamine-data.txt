"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been observed, but there are insufficient data to support an estimate of their frequency. Autonomic Nervous System*: Postural hypotension, tachycardia, inhibition of ejaculation, nasal congestion, miosis. *These so-called "side effects" are actually evidence of adrenergic blockade and vary according to the degree of blockade. Miscellaneous: Gastrointestinal irritation, drowsiness, fatigue."$$

"Drug Interactions 2 Dibenzyline (phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride) may interact with compounds that stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors (i.e., epinephrine) to produce an exaggerated hypotensive response and tachycardia. (See WARNING.) Dibenzyline blocks hyperthermia production by levarterenol, and blocks hypothermia production by reserpine."$$
