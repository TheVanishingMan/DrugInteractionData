        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (> 2%) reported in clinical trials was headache. The most common adverse reaction observed in > 2% of patients in clinical trials was headache (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cangene Corporation at 1-800-768-2304 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 14 adverse reactions were reported following IXINITY administration among 6 of the 77 subjects who received at least one dose of IXINITY in trials of previously treated patients (PTPs), which included 11 subjects < 18 years of age. A total of 9641 infusions of IXINITY were administered to the 77 subjects. The adverse reactions that were assessed as probably or possibly related to study drug are provided in the table below. Table 3 Summary of Adverse Reactions MedDRA Standard System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Number of Events Number of Patients (n = 77) (%) Congenital, familial and genetic disorders Hemophilia (i.e. lack of efficacy) 1 1 (1.3%) General disorders and administration site conditions Asthenia 1 1 (1.3%) Injection site discomfort 1 1 (1.3%) Infections and infestations Influenza 1 1 (1.3%) Nervous system disorders Headache 5 2 (2.6%) Dysgeusia 1 1 (1.3%) Lethargy 1 1 (1.3%) Psychiatric disorders Apathy 1 1 (1.3%) Depression 1 1 (1.3%) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash pruritic 1 1 (1.3%) 6.2 Immunogenicity All subjects participating in the clinical trial were monitored for inhibitory and non-inhibitory antibodies to factor IX and antibodies for CHO proteins at the following time points; pre-infusion, after the first 5 exposure days, and then every 3 months thereafter. No subjects in IXINITY clinical trials developed inhibitors to factor IX, including 55 subjects with more than 50 exposure days and 45 of those subjects with more than 100 exposure days. Non-inhibitory factor IX binding antibodies were detected in 30% (23/77) of subjects, including 5 subjects positive at baseline. In three of the subjects, the non-inhibitory factor IX antibodies were persistent, while in the remainder the antibodies were sporadic and non-persistent. No clinical adverse findings related to non-inhibitory factor IX antibody formation were identified. Detection of non-inhibitory antibodies against factor IX has been reported following administration of other factor IX products. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. In IXINITY clinical trials, 29% (20/68) of subjects tested positive for antibodies against CHO cell proteins. No clinical adverse findings were associated with these antibodies. Reports have been published of sporadic detection of antibodies against CHO cell proteins in subjects treated with other recombinant coagulation factor products produced in CHO cells, as well as in non-hemophilic subjects (). The clinical significance of this is unknown. The manufacturing process for IXINITY was modified to include an additional step to ensure increased clearance of CHO proteins to address the anti-CHO protein response seen in clinical trials. The anti-CHO protein response status of the clinical trial subjects who transitioned to the modified product (n = 17) remained negative (n = 10), stable/nonspecific assay binding (n = 5), or declined (n = 2) after the transition to modified IXINITY for at least 3 months. The detection of antibody formation is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection and concomitant medications. For these reasons, comparisons of the incidence of antibodies to IXINITY with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Should symptoms occur, discontinue IXINITY and administer appropriate treatment. Patients may also develop hypersensitivity to hamster (CHO) protein, which is present in trace amounts in the product (5.1). Development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to IXINITY may occur. If expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, perform an assay that measures factor IX inhibitor concentration (5.2). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following immune tolerance induction with factor IX products in hemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors (5.3). The use of factor IX-containing products has been associated with the development of thromboembolism (5.4). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with IXINITY, and have been reported with factor IX containing products. Signs of allergic reactions, which can progress to anaphylaxis, may include angioedema, chest tightness, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, paresthesia, restlessness, wheezing and dyspnea. Immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate treatment if allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur. In case of severe allergic reactions, consider alternative hemostatic measures. There are literature reports of allergic reactions occurring in close temporal association with the development of factor IX inhibitors. IXINITY contains trace amounts of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) proteins. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to CHO proteins. 5.2 Inhibitors If expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled as expected with the calculated dose, perform an assay that measures factor IX inhibitor concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Patients with factor IX inhibitors are at an increased risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis if re-exposed to IXINITY. 5.3 Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome may occur with IXINITY. Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in hemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. 5.4 Thromboembolism Thromboembolism may occur with using IXINITY (e.g., pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, and arterial thrombosis), and has been associated with the use of factor IX containing products. Because of the potential risk for thromboembolism with the use of factor IX products, monitor for early signs of thromboembolism and consumptive coagulopathy when administering IXINITY to patients with liver disease, fibrinolysis, peri-operative status, or risk for thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation. 5.5 Monitoring Laboratory Tests Monitor patients for factor IX activity levels with the one-stage clotting assay to confirm that adequate factor IX levels have been achieved and maintained, when clinically indicated. Factor IX results can be affected by the type of aPTT reagent used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor patients for the development of inhibitors if expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose of IXINITY. Assays used to determine if factor IX inhibitor is present should be titered in Bethesda Units (BUs)."

The RUCONEST clinical development program evaluated a combined total of 940 administrations in 236 subjects (symptomatic and non-symptomatic). In clinical studies, a total of 205 symptomatic HAE patients received treatment with RUCONEST for a combined total of 650 acute angioedema attacks. Among these HAE patients, 83 were treated for a single HAE attack and 122 were treated for multiple attacks. Three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were conducted in which 137 patients experiencing acute HAE attacks received RUCONEST (either an initial 50 U/kg or 100 U/kg body weight dose) or placebo (saline solution). Table 2 shows all adverse reactions (ARs) in the RCTs, compared with the placebo group. Table 2.

Included in this population were 124 patients who were treated at the 50 U/kg dosage strength for one or more attacks. Table 3 shows adverse reactions in >= 2% of patients in any RUCONEST group for the integrated dataset combining all seven RCT and OLE studies in patients experiencing acute HAE attacks. Table 3. Adverse reactions in the seven RCT and OLE studies occurring >= 2% of RUCONEST-treated patients (all doses), irrespective of causality * RUCONEST doses: doses up to 100 U/kg MedDRA: Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 15.0. MedDRA Preferred Term All RUCONEST doses* N=205 n(%) Headache 19 (9%) Nausea 5 (2%) Diarrhea 5 (2%) Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Pre- and post-exposure samples from 205 HAE patients treated for 650 acute attacks with RUCONEST were tested for the antibodies against plasma-derived C1INH or rhC1INH and for antibodies against host-related impurities (HRI). Testing was performed prior to and after treatment of a first attack and subsequent repeated attacks at 7, 22 or 28, and 90 days after RUCONEST treatment. Prior to the first exposure to RUCONEST, the frequency of anti-C1INH antibodies varied from 1.2% to 1.6% of samples. After the first exposure, the frequency of anti-C1INH antibodies varied from 0.6% to 1.0% of samples tested. After repeated exposures, the frequency of anti-C1INH antibodies varied from 0.5 to 2.2% of samples tested. The frequency of anti-HRI antibodies was 1.0% in pre-exposure samples, and after the first exposure varied from 3.5% to 4.6%. After repeated exposure, the frequency of anti-HRI antibodies varied from 5.7% to 17% of samples. At least 10% of subjects formed a specific antibody response to RUCONEST after five treated HAE attacks. No anti-C1INH neutralizing antibodies were detected. Observed anti-C1INH and anti-HRI antibodies were not associated with adverse clinical findings. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to RUCONEST with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. Adverse reactions in HAE patients receiving RUCONEST include abdominal pain and rash."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis may occur. Should symptoms occur, discontinue RUCONEST and administer appropriate treatment. (5.1) -Serious arterial and venous thromboembolic (TE) events have been reported at the recommended dose of plasma derived C1 esterase inhibitor products in patients with risk factors. Monitor patients with known risk factors for TE events during and after RUCONEST administration. (5.2) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. The signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions may include hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and/or anaphylaxis during or after injection of RUCONEST. Should symptoms occur, discontinue RUCONEST and institute appropriate treatment. Because hypersensitivity reactions may have symptoms similar to HAE attacks, treatment methods should be carefully considered. 5.2 Thromboembolic Events Serious arterial and venous thromboembolic (TE) events have been reported at the recommended dose of plasma derived C1 esterase inhibitor products in patients with risk factors. Risk factors may include the presence of an indwelling venous catheter/access device, prior history of thrombosis, underlying atherosclerosis, use of oral contraceptives or certain androgens, morbid obesity, and immobility. Monitor patients with known risk factors for TE events during and after RUCONEST administration."

To avoid excessive or insufficient anticoagulation, regularly perform coagulation tests suitable for the anticoagulant used, at close intervals, especially in the first hours following the start or withdrawal of ATryn and monitor patients for bleeding or thrombosis. (5.2) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur during administration, treatment must be discontinued immediately and emergency treatment should be administered. 5.2 Coagulation Monitoring Tests The anticoagulant effect of drugs that use antithrombin to exert their anticoagulation may be altered when ATryn is added or withdrawn. To avoid excessive or insufficient anticoagulation, coagulation tests suitable for the anticoagulant used (e.g., aPTT and anti-Factor Xa activity) are to be performed regularly, at close intervals, and in particular in the first hours following the start or withdrawal of ATryn. Additionally, monitor the patients for the occurrence of bleeding or thrombosis in such situation."
