        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and also a CYP3A4 substrate. Co-administration of KETEK and drugs that induce or inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may affect KETEK plasma concentrations resulting in diminished efficacy or an increase or prolongation of both the therapeutic and adverse effects; therefore, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary for drugs co-administered with telithromycin. Studies were performed to evaluate the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on telithromycin and the effect of telithromycin on drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In addition, drug interaction studies were conducted with several other concomitantly prescribed drugs. Table 3 summarizes both drugs with pharmacokinetics that are affected by KETEK as well as drugs that affect the pharmacokinetics of KETEK. Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with KETEK Drugs That Are Affected By KETEK Drug(s) with Pharmacokinetics Affected by KETEK (Mechanism of interaction, if known) Recommendation (Exposure) Comments Cisapride (CYP3A4 Substrate) Contraindicated (Plasma exposure increased) Co-administration of cisapride with repeated doses of KETEK resulted in significant increases in QTc. [see Contraindications (4.4)] Pimozide (CYP3A4 Substrate) Contraindicated (Plasma exposure likely to be increased) Although there are no studies looking at the interaction between KETEK and pimozide, there is a potential risk of life-threatening QT prolongation. [see Contraindications (4.4)] Colchicine (CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein efflux transporter Substrate) Contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. (Plasma exposure increased) Risk of life-threatening colchicine toxicity. If co-administration of KETEK and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dose of colchicine. Monitor for symptoms of colchicine toxicity. [see Contraindications (4.5); Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Simvastatin, Lovastatin, and Atorvastatin (HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors metabolized by CYP3A4) (CYP3A4 Substrate) Avoid Use (Plasma exposure increased) High levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Avoid concomitant use of simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin with KETEK. If KETEK is prescribed, suspend therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin during the course of KETEK. An interaction may occur with simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin but not with statins which are not metabolized by CYP3A4. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Ergot Alkaloids Not Recommended (Plasma exposure likely to be increased) No specific drug interaction studies have been performed. However, acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia has been reported when macrolide antibiotics were co-administered with ergot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine). Without further data, the co-administration of KETEK and these drugs is not recommended. Calcium Channel Blockers (CYP3A4 Substrate) Use with Caution (Plasma exposure increased) Hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, and loss of consciousness have been observed in patients receiving concomitant treatment with calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem). Monitor for these adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers and adjust calcium channel blocker dosage as necessary. Midazolam (CYP3A4 Substrate) Use with Caution (Plasma exposure likely to be increased) Monitor for benzodiazepine-related adverse reactions and adjust midazolam dosage if necessary. Use caution with other benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by CYP3A4 and undergo a high first-pass effect (e.g., triazolam). Other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, hexobarbital, and phenytoin (CYP3A4 Substrates) Use with Caution (Plasma exposure likely to be increased) No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate these drug-drug interactions with KETEK. However, increases or prolongation of the therapeutic and/or adverse effects of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be observed if administered with KETEK. Metoprolol (CYP2D6 Substrate) Use with Caution (Plasma exposure increased) Co-administration of KETEK and metoprolol in patients with heart failure could lead to metoprolol toxicity and should be considered with caution. Monitor for metoprolol toxicity and adjust metoprolol dosage. Digoxin Use with Caution (Plasma exposure increased) Monitor for digoxin side effects or serum levels during concomitant administration of digoxin and KETEK. Theophylline Use with Caution (Plasma exposure minimally increased) Co-administration of theophylline may worsen gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting, especially in female patients. Administer theophylline and KETEK 1 hour apart to decrease the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects. Oral Anticoagulants Use with Caution (Plasma exposure increased) Spontaneous post-marketing reports suggest that administration of KETEK and oral anticoagulants concomitantly may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Consider monitoring prothrombin times/INR while patients are receiving KETEK and oral anticoagulants simultaneously. Drugs that Affect KETEK Drug(s) that Affect the Pharmacokinetics of KETEK Recommendation Comments Rifampin (CYP3A4 Inducer) Avoid Concomitant Use (Reduced KETEK exposure) Loss of KETEK effect is likely [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Other CYP3A4 inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) Avoid Concomitant Use (Reduced KETEK exposure) Loss of KETEK effect is likely [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Itraconazole and Ketoconazole Avoid Concomitant Use (Increased KETEK exposure) Increased KETEK toxicity is likely [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] CYP3A4 inducers: Decreased KETEK levels resulting in loss of efficacy. Avoid concomitant use. (7) CYP3A4 inhibitors: Increased KETEK levels and risk of adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use. (7) Drugs metabolized via CYP3A4 pathway: KETEK may increase levels of these concomitant medications. Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, monitor for concomitant drug toxicity. Consider dosage reduction. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Myasthenia gravis [see Contraindications (4.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] QTc prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Visual disturbances and loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most common adverse reactions (2% or greater) are diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 3 clinical trials, 4,780 patients (n=2702 in controlled trials) received oral dosages of KETEK 800 mg once daily for 5 days or 7 to 10 days. Note that treatment with KETEK for 5 days duration is not a recommended dosage regimen. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] In the combined Phase 3 studies, discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.4% of KETEK-treated patients and 4.3% of combined comparator-treated patients. Most discontinuations in the KETEK group were due to adverse reactions in the gastrointestinal body system, primarily diarrhea (0.9% for KETEK vs. 0.7% for comparators), and nausea (0.7% for KETEK vs. 0.5% for comparators). Adverse reactions (ARs) occurring in clinical studies in 2% or more of KETEK patients are included below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in 2% or more of Patients in Controlled Phase 3 Clinical Studies Adverse ReactionBased on a frequency of all and possibly related adverse reactions of 2% or more in KETEK or comparator groups. Percent Incidence KETEK n= 2702 ComparatorIncludes comparators from all controlled Phase 3 studies. n= 2139 Diarrhea 10% 8% Nausea 7% 4.1% Dizziness (excl. vertigo) 2.8% 1.5% Vomiting 2.4% 1.4% Less Common Adverse Reactions Frequency of 0.2% or more and less than 2% The following adverse reactions were observed at a frequency of 0.2% or more and less than 2% in KETEK-treated patients in clinical studies. Gastrointestinal system: abdominal distension, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal upset, flatulence, constipation, gastroenteritis, gastritis, anorexia, oral candidiasis, glossitis, stomatitis. Liver and biliary system: abnormal liver function tests: increased transaminases (i.e., ALT, AST). Hepatitis, with or without jaundice, occurred in 0.07% of patients treated with KETEK. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Nervous system: dry mouth, somnolence, insomnia, vertigo, increased sweating Body as a whole: abdominal pain, fatigue Special senses: Visual adverse reactions, some of them severe, most often included blurred vision, diplopia, or difficulty focusing. Some patients discontinued therapy due to these adverse reactions. Visual adverse reactions were reported as having occurred after any dose during treatment, but most (65%) occurred following the first or second dose. Visual adverse reactions lasted several hours and recurred upon subsequent dosing in some patients. For patients who continued treatment, some visual adverse reactions resolved on therapy while others persisted through the full course of treatment. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Females and patients under 40 years old experienced a higher incidence of KETEK-associated visual adverse reactions. Table 2 provides the incidence of all visual adverse reactions in controlled Phase 3 studies by age and gender. The group with the highest incidence was females under the age of 40, while males over the age of 40 had rates of visual adverse reactions similar to comparator-treated patients. Table 2. Incidence of All Visual Adverse Reactions in Controlled Phase 3 Studies Gender/Age Telithromycin ComparatorsIncludes all comparators combined Female 40 and under 2.1% (14/682) 0.0% (0/534) Female greater than 40 1.0% (7/703) 0.35% (2/574) Male 40 and under 1.2% (7/563) 0.48% (2/417) Male greater than 40 0.27% (2/754) 0.33% (2/614) Total 1.1% (30/2702) 0.28% (6/2139) Urogenital system: vaginal candidiasis, vaginitis, vaginosis fungal Skin: rash Hematologic: increased platelet count Frequency of less than 0.2% Other clinically-significant adverse reactions occurring in less than 0.2% of patients treated with KETEK from the controlled Phase 3 studies included: anxiety, bradycardia, eczema, elevated blood bilirubin, erythema multiforme, flushing, hypotension, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, increased eosinophil count, paresthesia, pruritus, urticaria. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KETEK. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic: face edema, severe allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis Cardiovascular: atrial arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes) with potential fatal outcome, palpitation, ischemic cardiac events in the context of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Gastrointestinal system: pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5] Liver and biliary system: Hepatic dysfunction, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure, chromaturia [see Contraindications (4.2); Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps, arthralgia, myalgia, exacerbation of myasthenia gravis [see Contraindications (4.1)] Nervous system: loss of consciousness, in some cases associated with vagal syndrome, tremor, convulsions Psychiatric disorders: confusion, hallucinations (mostly visual) Special senses: taste/smell perversion and/or loss, hearing loss Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Fatal acute liver injury has been reported. Discontinue immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. (5.1) Prolongation of QTc interval: Increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes with fatal outcomes. Avoid use in patients with known QTc prolongation, hypokalemia, and with class IA and III antiarrhythmics. (5.2) Visual disturbances and loss of consciousness: KETEK may impair accommodation. Avoid driving or other hazardous activity. (5.3) Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Drugs: Fatalities with colchicine, rhabdomyolysis with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and hypotension with calcium channel blockers have been reported. Avoid concomitant use. Monitor for toxicity and consider dose reduction of the concomitant medication, if concomitant use is unavoidable (5.4, 7) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.5) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Acute hepatic failure and severe liver injury, in some cases fatal, have been reported in patients treated with KETEK. These hepatic reactions included fulminant hepatitis and hepatic necrosis leading to liver transplant, and were observed during or immediately after treatment. In some of these cases, liver injury progressed rapidly and occurred after administration of a few doses of KETEK. Physicians and patients should monitor for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, alcoholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue KETEK and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver function tests. If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms occur, KETEK should be permanently discontinued. KETEK is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of hepatitis and/or jaundice associated with the use of KETEK tablets, or any macrolide antibacterial. [see Contraindications (4.2)] In addition, less severe hepatic dysfunction associated with increased liver enzymes, hepatitis and in some cases jaundice was reported with the use of KETEK. These events associated with less severe forms of liver toxicity were reversible. 5.2 QTc Prolongation KETEK can prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients leading to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes with fatal outcomes. Thus, KETEK should be avoided in patients with congenital prolongation of the QTc interval, and in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (e.g., quinidine and procainamide) or Class III (e.g., dofetilide) antiarrhythmic agents. Cases of ventricular arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes) have been reported post-marketing with KETEK and sometimes occurred within a few hours of the first dose. In clinical trials, no cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with KETEK treatment in 4780 patients, including 204 patients having a prolonged QTc at baseline. 5.3 Visual Disturbances and Loss of Consciousness KETEK may cause visual disturbances particularly in slowing the ability to accommodate and the ability to release accommodation. Visual disturbances, some of them severe, included blurred vision, difficulty focusing, and diplopia. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] There have been post-marketing reports of transient loss of consciousness including some cases associated with vagal syndrome. Because of potential visual difficulties or loss of consciousness, patients should attempt to minimize activities such as driving a motor vehicle, operating heavy machinery or engaging in other hazardous activities during treatment with KETEK. If patients experience visual disorders or loss of consciousness while taking KETEK, patients should not drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery or engage in other hazardous activities. 5.4 Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Drugs Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking KETEK concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates [see Drug Interactions (7)]: Colchicine: colchicine toxicity Simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin: rhabdomyolysis Calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem): hypotension Colchicine Toxicity Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. KETEK is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended dosages. If co-administration of KETEK and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dosage of colchicine. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of KETEK and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. [see Contraindications (4.5); Drug Interactions (7)] Rhabdomyolysis Simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4. High levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Avoid use of statins which are metabolized by CYP3A4 concomitantly with KETEK; suspend therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin during the course of treatment with KETEK. [see Drug Interactions (7)] Hypotension Hypotension, bradyarrhythmia and loss of consciousness have been observed in patients receiving concomitant treatment with calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem). Monitor for these adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers and adjust calcium channel blocker dosage as necessary. [see Drug Interactions (7)] 5.5 Clostridum difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including KETEK, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing KETEK in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

        "Drug interactions Telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 system. Co-administration of KETEK tablets and a drug primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentration of the drug co-administered with telithromycin that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary for the drug co-administered with telithromycin. The use of KETEK is contraindicated with cisapride. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions ) The use of KETEK is contraindicated with pimozide. Although there are no studies looking at the interaction between KETEK and pimozide, there is a potential risk of increased pimozide plasma levels by inhibition of CYP 3A4 pathways by KETEK as with macrolides. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) In a pharmacokinetic study, simvastatin levels were increased due to CYP 3A4 inhibition by telithromycin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions ) Similarly, an interaction may occur with lovastatin or atorvastatin but not with statins which are not metabolized by CYP3A4. High levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Use of simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin concomitantly with KETEK should be avoided. If KETEK is prescribed, therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment. Patients concomitantly treated with statins should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP 3A4 and the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and a significant increase in colchicine plasma concentration is anticipated when co-administered with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as telithromycin. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS, Drug interactions). Monitoring of digoxin side effects or serum levels should be considered during concomitant administration of digoxin and KETEK. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions.) Hypotension, bradyarrhythmia and loss of consciousness have been observed in patients receiving concomitant treatment with calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP 3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem). Patients should be monitored with concomitant administration of midazolam and dosage adjustment of midazolam should be considered if necessary. Precaution should be used with other benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by CYP 3A4 and undergo a high first-pass effect (e.g., triazolam). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions.) Concomitant treatment of KETEK with rifampin, a CYP 3A4 inducer, should be avoided. Concomitant administration of other CYP 3A4 inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital is likely to result in subtherapeutic levels of telithromycin and loss of effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Other drug interactions .) In patients treated with metoprolol for heart failure, the increased exposure to metoprolol, a CYP 2D6 substrate, may be of clinical importance. Therefore, co-administration of KETEK and metoprolol in patients with heart failure should be considered with caution. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug interactions.) Spontaneous post-marketing reports suggest that administration of KETEK and oral anticoagulants concomitantly may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Consideration should be given to monitoring prothrombin times/INR while patients are receiving KETEK and oral anticoagulants simultaneously. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate the following potential drug-drug interactions with KETEK. However, these drug interactions have been observed with macrolide products. Drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system such as carbamazepine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, hexobarbital, and phenytoin: elevation of serum levels of these drugs may be observed when co-administered with telithromycin. As a result, increases or prolongation of the therapeutic and/or adverse effects of the concomitant drug may be observed. Ergot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine or dihydroergotamine): acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia has been reported when macrolide antibiotics were co-administered. Without further data, the co-administration of KETEK and these drugs is not recommended."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In Phase III clinical trials, 4,780 patients (n=2702 in controlled trials) received daily oral doses of KETEK 800 mg once daily for 5 days or 7 to 10 days. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. In the combined Phase III studies, discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 4.4% of KETEK-treated patients and 4.3% of combined comparator-treated patients. Most discontinuations in the KETEK group were due to treatment-emergent adverse events in the gastrointestinal body system, primarily diarrhea (0.9% for KETEK vs. 0.7% for comparators), nausea (0.7% for KETEK vs. 0.5% for comparators). All and possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in controlled clinical studies in >= 2.0% of all patients are included below: Table 5 All and Possibly Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Phase III Clinical Studies (Percent Incidence) Adverse Event All TEAEs Possibly-Related TEAEs KETEK n= 2702 ComparatorIncludes comparators from all controlled Phase III studies. n= 2139 KETEK n= 2702 Comparator n= 2139 Diarrhea 10.8% 8.6% 10.0% 8.0% Nausea 7.9% 4.6% 7.0% 4.1% Headache 5.5% 5.8% 2.0% 2.5% Dizziness (excl. vertigo) 3.7% 2.7% 2.8% 1.5% Vomiting 2.9% 2.2% 2.4% 1.4% Loose Stools 2.3% 1.5% 2.1% 1.4% Dysgeusia 1.6% 3.6% 1.5% 3.6% The following events judged by investigators to be at least possibly drug related were observed infrequently (>= 0.2% and < 2%), in KETEK-treated patients in the controlled Phase III studies. Gastrointestinal system: abdominal distension, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal upset, flatulence, constipation, gastroenteritis, gastritis, anorexia, oral candidiasis, glossitis, stomatitis, watery stools. Liver and biliary system: abnormal liver function tests: increased transaminases, increased liver enzymes (e.g., ALT, AST) were usually asymptomatic and reversible. ALT elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in 1.6%, and 1.7% of patients treated with KETEK and comparators, respectively. Hepatitis, with or without jaundice, occurred in 0.07% of patients treated with KETEK, and was reversible. (See PRECAUTIONS, General .) Nervous system: dry mouth, somnolence, insomnia, vertigo, increased sweating Body as a whole: abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, fatigue Special senses: Visual adverse events most often included blurred vision, diplopia, or difficulty focusing. Most events were mild to moderate; however, severe cases have been reported. Some patients discontinued therapy due to these adverse events. Visual adverse events were reported as having occurred after any dose during treatment, but most visual adverse events (65%) occurred following the first or second dose. Visual events lasted several hours and recurred upon subsequent dosing in some patients. For patients who continued treatment, some resolved on therapy while others continued to have symptoms until they completed the full course of treatment. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Information for patients .) Females and patients under 40 years old experienced a higher incidence of telithromycin-associated visual adverse events. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Urogenital system: vaginal candidiasis, vaginitis, vaginosis fungal Skin: rash Hematologic: increased platelet count Other possibly related clinically-relevant events occurring in <0.2% of patients treated with KETEK from the controlled Phase III studies included: anxiety, bradycardia, eczema, elevated blood bilirubin, erythema multiforme, flushing, hypotension, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, increased eosinophil count, paresthesia, pruritus, urticaria. Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been reported from worldwide post-marketing experience with KETEK. Allergic: face edema, rare reports of severe allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis Cardiovascular: atrial arrhythmias, palpitations Gastrointestinal system: pancreatitis Liver and biliary system: Hepatic dysfunction has been reported. Severe and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with KETEK. These hepatic reactions were observed during or immediately after treatment. In some of these cases, liver injury progressed rapidly and occurred after administration of only a few doses of KETEK. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS .) Severe reactions, in some but not all cases, have been associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. Data from post-marketing reports and clinical trials show that most cases of hepatic dysfunction were mild to moderate. (See PRECAUTIONS, General .) Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps, rare reports of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.) arthralgia, myalgia Nervous system: loss of consciousness, in some cases associated with vagal syndrome. Psychiatric disorders: confusion, hallucinations (mostly visual) Special senses: taste/smell perversion and/or loss"
