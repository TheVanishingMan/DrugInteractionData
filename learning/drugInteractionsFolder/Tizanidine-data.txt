        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-667-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare:Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System Infrequent:Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare:Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System Frequent:Myasthenia, back pain;Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System Frequent:Depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent:Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System Infrequent:Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: Asthma. Skin and Appendages Frequent:Rash, sweating, skin ulcer; Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria; Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma. Special Senses Infrequent:Ear pain, tinnitus, deafness, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, eye pain, optic neuritis, otitis media, retinal hemorrhage, visual field defect; Rare:Iritis, keratitis, optic atrophy. Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1,385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]"

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α 2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and Tizanidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and Tizanidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate Tizanidine Tablets, USP with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. The CNS depressant effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Tizanidine Tablets, USP with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that Tizanidine Tablets, USP be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists.

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when Tizanidine Tablets, USP is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that Tizanidine Tablets, USP be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. Therefore, concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine Tablets, USP may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine Tablets, USP can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Tizanidine Tablets, USP with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine Tablets, USP use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing Tizanidine Tablets, USP in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, Tizanidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin.

Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine Tablets, USP can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4) ] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine Tablets, USP should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine Tablets, USP may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of Tizanidine Tablets, USP (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if Tizanidine Tablets, USP is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use Tizanidine Tablets, USP with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) -Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) -Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) -Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) -Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) -Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg (base) of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4Hallucinosis/Psychotic-like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One FDA approved labeling dated October 4, 2013 patient among these five continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg (base) to 28 mg (base) daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg (base) to 4 mg (base) per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]"

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 mg/day to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported. -Stevens Johnson Syndrome -Anaphylactic Reaction -Exfoliative Dermatitis -Ventricular Tachycardia -Hepatitis -Convulsion -Depression -Arthralgia -Paresthesia -Rash -Tremor"

Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See and ). CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See and ). CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See ) WARNINGS Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see ).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study—Common Adverse Events Reported Table 2: Event Placebo N =48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8 mg, N =45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N =49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia * 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 * (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) Tizanidine was administered to 1385 patients in additional clinical studies where adverse event information was available. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. Other Adverse Events Observed During The Evaluation Of Tizanidine In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare:Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System Infrequent:Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare:Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System Frequent:Myasthenia, back pain;Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System Frequent:Depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent:Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System Infrequent:Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: Asthma. Skin and Appendages Frequent:Rash, sweating, skin ulcer; Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria; Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma. Special Senses Infrequent:Ear pain, tinnitus, deafness, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, eye pain, optic neuritis, otitis media, retinal hemorrhage, visual field defect; Rare:Iritis, keratitis, optic atrophy. Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. 2 Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clincial Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clincial Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clincially necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive. [see Clincial Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clincial Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2 -adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2 -adrenergic agonists.

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: - Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] - Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] - Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] - Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] - Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clincial Trials Experience Because clincial studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clincial studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clincial studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clincial significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported. - Stevens Johnson Syndrome - Anaphylactic Reaction - Exfoliative Dermatitis - Ventricular Tachycardia - Hepatitis - Convulsion - Depression - Arthralgia - Paresthesia - Rash - Tremor"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) - Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) - Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) - Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) - Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) - Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when ​tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clincially evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4)] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]"

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations (see WARNINGS). Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. Table 1: Multiple Dose, Placebo-Controlled Studies—Frequent (> 2%) Adverse Events Reported for Which Tizanidine Tablets Incidence is Greater than Placebo Event Placebo N = 261 % Zanaflex Tablet N = 264 % Dry mouth 10 49 Somnolence 10 48 Asthenia (weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness) 16 41 Dizziness 4 16 UTI 7 10 Infection 5 6 Constipation 1 4 Liver function tests abnormal <1 3 Vomiting 0 3 Speech disorder 0 3 Amblyopia (blurred vision) <1 3 Urinary frequency 2 3 Flu syndrome 2 3 SGPT/ALT increased <1 3 Dyskinesia 0 3 Nervousness <1 3 Pharyngitis 1 3 Rhinitis 2 3 In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity, the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse events: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study—Common Adverse Events Reported Event Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia(weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness) 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 OTHER ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED DURING THE EVALUATION OF TIZANIDINE Tizanidine was administered to 1385 patients in additional clinical studies where adverse event information was available. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. BODY AS A WHOLE Frequent: Fever Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulites, death, overdose Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis Rare: Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL SYSTEM Infrequent: Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss Rare: Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM Frequent: Myasthenia, back pain Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis NERVOUS SYSTEM Frequent: Depression, anxiety, paresthesia Infrequent: Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Infrequent: Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis Rare: Asthma SKIN AND APPENDAGES Frequent: Rash, sweating, skin ulcer Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma SPECIAL SENSES Infrequent: Ear pain, tinnitus, deafness, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, eye pain, optic neuritis, otitis media, retinal hemorrhage, visual field defect Rare: Iritis, keratitis, optic atrophy UROGENITAL SYSTEM Infrequent: Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 α 2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4% were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists. ( 5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs. ( 5.2) Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive. ( 5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride ( 5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine. ( 5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose. ( 5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α 2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α 2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)] . 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine. Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3,12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and Zanaflex is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and Zanaflex is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment sSee Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of Zanaflex with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Zanaflex therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of Zanaflex with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate Zanaflex with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Zanaflex therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of Zanaflex. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of Zanaflex. The CNS depressant effects of Zanaflex and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Zanaflex with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Zanaflex with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that Zanaflex be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists.

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received Zanaflex where the frequency in the Zanaflex group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further characterized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole: Frequent: fever; Infrequent: allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System: Infrequent: vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System: Frequent: abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare:Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System Infrequent:Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare:Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System Frequent:Myasthenia, back pain;Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System Frequent:Depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent:Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System Infrequent:Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: Asthma. Skin and Appendages Frequent:Rash, sweating, skin ulcer; Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria; Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma. Special Senses Infrequent:Ear pain, tinnitus, deafness, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, eye pain, optic neuritis, otitis media, retinal hemorrhage, visual field defect; Rare:Iritis, keratitis, optic atrophy. Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ).

These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations.

Concomitant use of tizanidine with CYP1A2 inhibitors should ordinarily be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, they should be used with caution (see WARNINGS). Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives."

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1,385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Body as a Whole: Frequent: fever; Infrequent: allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System: Infrequent: vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System: Frequent: abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Infrequent: ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare: petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System: Infrequent: edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare: adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System: Frequent: myasthenia, back pain; Infrequent: pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System: Frequent: depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent: tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System: Infrequent: sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: asthma.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Indications and Usage (1)]",

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported. 1.Stevens Johnson Syndrome 2.Anaphylactic Reaction 3.Exfoliative Dermatitis 4.Ventricular Tachycardia 5.Hepatitis 6.Convulsion 7.Depression 8.Arthralgia 9.Paresthesia 10.Rash 11.Tremor"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) 1.Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) 2.Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) 3.Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) 4.Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) 5.Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One Indications and Usage (1) patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "Drug Interactions In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives."

Common Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness.

Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided. In the single dose, placebo-controlled study involving 142 patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies (14)], the patients were specifically asked if they had experienced any of the four most common adverse reactions: dry mouth, somnolence (drowsiness), asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. Onepatient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare:Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System Infrequent:Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare:Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System Frequent:Myasthenia, back pain;Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System Frequent:Depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent:Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System Infrequent:Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: Asthma. Skin and Appendages Frequent:Rash, sweating, skin ulcer; Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria; Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma.

Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "Drug Interactions In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Acetaminophen: Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol: Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse events are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1187 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and Tizanidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate Tizanidine Tablets, USP with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. The CNS depressant effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Tizanidine Tablets, USP with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that Tizanidine Tablets, USP be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists.

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received Tizanidine Tablets, USP where the frequency in the Tizanidine Tablets, USP group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when Tizanidine Tablets, USP is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that Tizanidine Tablets, USP be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of Tizanidine Tablets, USP. Therefore, concomitant use of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)andDrug Interactions (7.1, 7.2 )]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine Tablets, USP may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine Tablets, USP can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take Tizanidine Tablets, USP with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine Tablets, USP use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing Tizanidine Tablets, USP in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, Tizanidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when Tizanidine Tablets, USP is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for Tizanidine Tablets, USP therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine Tablets, USP can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4) ] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] -Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; Tizanidine Tablets, USP should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) -Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue Tizanidine Tablets, USP if liver injury occurs (5.2) -Sedation: Tizanidine Tablets, USP may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of Tizanidine Tablets, USP, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) -Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of Tizanidine Tablets, USP (5.4) -Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if Tizanidine Tablets, USP is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) -Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use Tizanidine Tablets, USP with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7)"

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia.

Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS FluvoxamineThe effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CiprofloxacinThe effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CYP1A2 InhibitorsThe interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations (see WARNINGS). Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "Drug Interactions In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, including zileuton, other fluroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine and famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CYP1A2 inhibitors should ordinarily be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, they should be used with caution (see WARNINGS ). Acetaminophen: Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol: Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine that women not on oral contraceptives."

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System Frequent: Abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: Dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: Gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage. Hemic and Lymphatic System Infrequent: Ecchymosis, hypercholesteremia, anemia, hyperlipemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, sepsis; Rare:Petechia, purpura, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional System Infrequent:Edema, hypothyroidism, weight loss; Rare:Adrenal cortex insufficiency, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoproteinemia, respiratory acidosis. Musculoskeletal System Frequent:Myasthenia, back pain;Infrequent: Pathological fracture, arthralgia, arthritis, bursitis. Nervous System Frequent:Depression, anxiety, paresthesia; Infrequent:Tremor, emotional lability, convulsion, paralysis, thinking abnormal, vertigo, abnormal dreams, agitation, depersonalization, euphoria, migraine, stupor, dysautonomia, neuralgia; Rare: Dementia, hemiplegia, neuropathy. Respiratory System Infrequent:Sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchitis; Rare: Asthma. Skin and Appendages Frequent:Rash, sweating, skin ulcer; Infrequent: Pruritus, dry skin, acne, alopecia, urticaria; Rare: Exfoliative dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, skin carcinoma.

Urogenital System Infrequent:Urinary urgency, cystitis, menorrhagia, pyelonephritis, urinary retention, kidney calculus, uterine fibroids enlarged, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis; Rare: Albuminuria, glycosuria, hematuria, metrorrhagia DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION Abuse potential was not evaluated in human studies. Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See and ).

(See and ). CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See ) WARNINGS Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see ).

Common Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTIONFluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS )."

Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting,speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1- week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3,12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4)] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 α 2 -Adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].",

Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3,12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4)] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]"

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofloxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications ( 4) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 mg to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 mg/day to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists ( 5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2) Sedation: tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive ( 5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics, cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ( 5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose ( 5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1, 7.2)] . 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications ( 4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations (see WARNINGS). Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

        "Drug Interactions In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives."

Common Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations (see WARNINGS). Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole Frequent:Fever; Infrequent: Allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: Carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System Infrequent: Vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: Angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [ s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine hydrochloride with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine hydrochloride. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine hydrochloride. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride and alcohol are additive.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 2% of 264 patients taking tizanidine and greater than in placebo-treated patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, dizziness, urinary tract infection, constipation, liver function tests abnormal, vomiting, speech disorder, amblyopia, urinary frequency, flu syndrome, SGPT/ALT increased, dyskinesia, nervousness, pharyngitis, and rhinitis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in postmarketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the postmarketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the postmarketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine hydrochloride should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine hydrochloride may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine hydrochloride, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine hydrochloride (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine hydrochloride is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine hydrochloride with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the postmarketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [ s ee Drug Interactions ( 7.5 , 7.6 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [ s ee Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [ s ee Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day).

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.) CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations (see WARNINGS). Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced by a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Concomitant use of tizanidine with CYP1A2 inhibitors should ordinarily be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, they should be used with caution (see WARNINGS ). Acetaminophen: Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol: Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Fluvoxamine: The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Ciprofloxacin: The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). CYP1A2 inhibitors: The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, including zileuton, other fluroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine and famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. Concomitant use of tizanidine with CYP1A2 inhibitors should ordinarily be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, they should be used with caution (see WARNINGS). Acetaminophen: Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol: Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Oral Contraceptives: No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity the most frequent adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]"

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists (5.1, 7.7) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs (5.2) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other CNS depressants are additive (5.3, 7.5, 7.6) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine (5.4) Less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2: may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness, use caution if tizanidine is used with less potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, e.g., zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics , cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine (5.5, 7.3, 12.3) Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min): use tizanidine with caution, and monitor closely for dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness as indicators of potential overdose (5.7) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6)]. 5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.8 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

        "In multiple doses, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including asevere adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) of patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%), and dizziness (2%). MOST FREQUENT ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF TIZANIDINE In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. ADVRSE EVENTS REPORTED IN CONTROLLED STUDIES The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists.

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15-69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20-28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1, 7.2)]. 5.2 Risk of Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected.

Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12. 3 ) ] 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4)] 5.7 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased.

        "Drug Interactions Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS) Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS) CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS).",

In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies patient ages ranged from 15 to 69 years and 51.4 percent were women. The median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine hydrochloride where the frequency in the tizanidine hydrochloride group was greater than the placebo group. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document. The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine hydrochloride. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine hydrochloride cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tizanidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension. Syncope has been reported in the post marketing setting. The chance of significant hypotension may possibly be minimized by titration of the dose and by focusing attention on signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dose advancement. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine hydrochloride is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine hydrochloride be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin and single doses of 4 mg of tizanidine hydrochloride. Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine hydrochloride with fluvoxamine or with ciprofloxacin, potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ]. Tizanidine hydrochloride may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine hydrochloride with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine hydrochloride with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Drug Interactions (7.5, 7.6 )] Tizanidine hydrochloride use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine hydrochloride in patients who develop hallucinations. Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine hydrochloride is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine ). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine hydrochloride therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution. [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tizanidine hydrochloride can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue have been reported. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions and instructed to discontinue tizanidine hydrochloride and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur. [see Contraindications (4)] Tizanidine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. These patients should be monitored closely for the onset or increase in severity of the common adverse events (dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia and dizziness) as indicators of potential overdose. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] Withdrawal adverse reactions include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 to 4 mg per day). [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Fluvoxamine Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Ciprofloxacin Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2 to 4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 α2-adrenergic Agonists Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other α2-adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] _Ref_7ac72350-606b-4758-21fe-4ed99663f39"

Three double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled -clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of tizanidine on spasticity control. Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse events were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further characterized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole: Frequent: fever; Infrequent: allergic reaction, moniliasis, malaise, abscess, neck pain, sepsis, cellulitis, death, overdose; Rare: carcinoma, congenital anomaly, suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System: Infrequent: vasodilatation, postural hypotension, syncope, migraine, arrhythmia; Rare: angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, heart failure, myocardial infarct, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia. Digestive System: Frequent: abdomen pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia; Infrequent: dysphagia, cholelithiasis, fecal impaction, flatulence, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, melena; Rare: gastroenteritis, hematemesis, hepatoma, intestinal obstruction, liver damage.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION Fluvoxamine The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). Ciprofloxacin The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. These changes resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and psychomotor impairment. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ). CYP1A2 Inhibitors The interaction between tizanidine and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations. (See WARNINGS ) Oral Contraceptives No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies, 264 patients were treated with tizanidine and 261 with placebo. Adverse events, including severe adverse events, were more frequently reported with tizanidine than with placebo. Common Adverse Events Leading To Discontinuation Forty-five of 264 (17%) patients receiving tizanidine and 13 of 261 (5%) patients receiving placebo in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies discontinued treatment for adverse events. When patients withdrew from the study, they frequently had more than one reason for discontinuing. The adverse events most frequently leading to withdrawal of tizanidine treated patients in the controlled clinical studies were asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) (3%), somnolence (3%), dry mouth (3%), increased spasm or tone (2%) and dizziness (2%). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen In Association With The Use Of Tizanidine In multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity, the most frequent adverse effects were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the events as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the events as being severe. These events appeared to be dose related. Adverse Events Reported In Controlled Studies The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical studies in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical studies, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 1 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was at least as common as in the placebo group. These events are not necessarily related to tizanidine treatment. For comparison purposes, the corresponding frequency of the event (per 100 patients) among placebo treated patients is also provided.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. Table 2: Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study—Common Adverse Events Reported Event Placebo N =48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8 mg, N =45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N =49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia * 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 * (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness) Other Adverse Events Observed During The Evaluation Of TizanidineTizanidine was administered to 1385 patients in additional clinical studies where adverse event information was available. The conditions and duration of exposure varied greatly, and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind and open-label studies, uncontrolled and controlled studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow, reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 1385 patients exposed to tizanidine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tizanidine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 1. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with tizanidine, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients, rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

Rats were able to distinguish tizanidine from saline in a standard discrimination paradigm, after training, but failed to generalize the effects of morphine, cocaine, diazepam or phenobarbital to tizanidine. Monkeys were shown to self-administer tizanidine in a dose-dependent manner, and abrupt cessation of tizanidine produced transient signs of withdrawal at doses > 35 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis. These transient withdrawal signs (increased locomotion, body twitching, and aversive behavior toward the observer) were not reversed by naloxone administration. Tizanidine is closely related to clonidine, which is often abused in combination with narcotics and is known to cause symptoms of rebound upon abrupt withdrawal. Three cases of rebound symptoms on sudden withdrawal of tizanidine have been reported. The case reports suggest that these patients were also misusing narcotics. Withdrawal symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, hypertonia, tremor, and anxiety. As with clonidine, withdrawal is expected to be more likely in cases where high doses are used, especially for prolonged periods."
