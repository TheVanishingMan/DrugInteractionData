        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 2% of patients and include life threatening anaphylactic reactions with respiratory distress, shock, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus. A death has been reported following IV administration of a similar compound (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Post-Marketing Experience Hypersensitivity Reactions: Case series report an overall incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in approximately 2% of patients. Life threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred. Manifestations include respiratory distress, shock, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus. A death has been reported following administration of a similar compound employed to estimate the depth of a severe burn. Reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a personal or family history of bronchial asthma, significant allergies, drug reactions or previous reactions to triphenylmethane dyes [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Laboratory Tests: Isosulfan blue injection 1% interferes with measurements of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and of methemoglobin by gas analyzer [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Skin: transient or long-term (tattooing) blue coloration."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Life threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred after isosulfan blue injection 1% administration. Monitor patients closely for at least 60 minutes after administration of isosulfan blue injection 1% (5.1). -The admixture of isosulfan blue injection 1% with local anesthetics results in an immediate precipitation of 4% to 9% drug complex. Use a separate syringe for anesthetics (5.2). -Isosulfan blue injection 1% interferes with measurements in peripheral blood pulse oximetry. Arterial blood gas analysis may be needed (5.3). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Life threatening anaphylactic reactions (respiratory distress, shock, angio-edema) have occurred after isosulfan blue injection 1% administration. Reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, allergies, drug reactions or previous reactions to triphenylmethane dyes. Monitor patients closely for at least 60 minutes after administration of isosulfan blue injection 1%. Trained personnel should be available to administer emergency care including resuscitation. 5.2 Precipitation of Isosulfan Blue Injection 1% by Lidocaine The admixture of isosulfan blue injection 1% (with local anesthetics (i.e. lidocaine)) in the same syringe results in an immediate precipitation of 4% to 9% drug complex. Use a separate syringe to administer a local anesthetic. 5.3 Interference with Oxygen Saturation and Methemoglobin Measurements Isosulfan blue injection 1% interferes with measurements of oxygen saturation in peripheral blood by pulse oximetry and can cause falsely low readings. The interference effect is maximal at 30 minutes and minimal generally by 4 hours after administration. Arterial blood gas analysis may be needed to verify decreased arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Isosulfan blue injection 1% may also cause falsely elevated readings of methemoglobin by arterial blood gas analyzer. Therefore, cooximetry may be needed to verify methemoglobin level."
