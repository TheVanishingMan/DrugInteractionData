"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tardive Dyskinesia (5.1) Acute Dystonic Reactions, Drug-induced Parkinsonism and Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms (5.2) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (5.3) Depression (5.4) Hypertension (5.5) Congestive Heart Failure and Ventricular Arrhythmia (5.6) Withdrawal from Metoclopramide (5.7) 5.1 Tardive Dyskinesia [see Boxed Warning] Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a potentially irreversible and disfiguring disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, or extremities. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose. An analysis of utilization patterns showed that about 20% of patients who used metoclopramide took it for longer than 12 weeks. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than the recommended 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing TD. Although the risk of developing TD in the general population may be increased among the elderly, women, and diabetics, it is not possible to predict which patients will develop metoclopramide-induced TD. Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increase with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Metoclopramide should be discontinued in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients, TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after metoclopramide is withdrawn. Metoclopramide itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long-term course of TD is unknown. Therefore, metoclopramide should not be used for the symptomatic control of TD. 5.2 Acute Dystonic Reactions, Drug-induced Parkinsonism, and Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), manifested primarily as acute dystonic reactions, occur in approximately 1 in 500 patients treated with the usual adult dosages of 30 to 40 mg/day of metoclopramide. These usually are seen during the first 24 to 48 hours of treatment with metoclopramide, occur more frequently in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age and are even more frequent at higher doses. These symptoms may include involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions may present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. If these symptoms occur, inject 50 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride intramuscularly. Benztropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg intramuscularly, may also be used to reverse these reactions. Drug-induced Parkinsonism can occur during metoclopramide therapy, more commonly within the first 6 months after beginning treatment, but also after longer periods. Parkinsonian symptoms generally subside within 2 to 3 months following discontinuation of metoclopramide. Patients with a history of Parkinson's disease should be given metoclopramide cautiously, if at all, since such patients can experience exacerbation of Parkinsonian symptoms when taking metoclopramide. 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and, treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Depression Depression associated with metoclopramide use has occurred in patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms ranged from mild to severe and included suicidal ideation and suicide. For those patients with a prior history of depression, metoclopramide should only be given if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks. 5.5 Hypertension In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is used in patients with hypertension. There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in some patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma, thus any rapid rise in blood pressure associated with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets use should result in immediate cessation of metoclopramide use in those patients [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.6 Congestive Heart Failure and Ventricular Arrhythmia Since metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. If these side effects occur at any time in any patients during metoclopramide therapy, the drug should be discontinued. 5.7 Withdrawal from Metoclopramide Adverse reactions, especially those involving the nervous system, may occur after stopping the use of Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets. A small number of patients may experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping that could include dizziness, nervousness, and/or headaches. Phenylketonurics: Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Each 5 mg and 10 mg Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets contains 4.7 mg of phenylalanine."$$

"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>2%) are headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and somnolence (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novel Laboratories, Inc. at 1-866-403-7592 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 86 subjects entered three studies with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets; 12 subjects entered a pilot bioavailability study (BA); 44 subjects entered a bioequivalence (BE) study, and 30 subjects entered a food-effect study. The adverse reactions from the BE and food-effect study are summarized in Table 1. The pilot BA study data are not included because it was performed with a formulation different from the Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets formulation. The adverse experience profile seen with Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets was similar to metoclopramide tablets. Thirty-three (33) adverse reactions were reported after receiving Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets and 30 adverse reactions were reported after receiving metoclopramide tablets.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than 2%) associated with metoclopramide tablets were: nausea, headache, fatigue, somnolence, and dizziness. The combined data from the fasted BE study and the food-effect study did not demonstrate any significant differences in the adverse event profile for Metoclopramide Hydrochloride Orally Disintegrating Tablets compared to metoclopramide tablets. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions are from the cumulative post-marketing experience with metoclopramide tablets. Since the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. CNS Effects: Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude occur in approximately 10% of patients receiving the most commonly prescribed dosage of 10 mg four times a day. Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or depression with suicidal ideation occurs less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of seizures without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Syndromes (EPS): Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drug-induced Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Tardive dyskinesia is most frequently characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance. Motor restlessness (akathisia) may include inability to sit still, pacing, and foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Rare occurrences of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Endocrine Disturbances: Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia. Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, possible AV block. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic: Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal: Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic: A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates. Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults. Allergic Reactions: A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema.

"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility can impact the absorption of other drugs. The known drug-drug interactions are listed below. Anticholinergic drugs: Antagonize effects of metoclopramide (7.1) Narcotic analgesic drugs: May increase sedation (7.1) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: May cause hypertensive crisis (due to catecholamine release) (7.2) Altered drug absorption: May decrease absorption of drugs from the stomach and increase absorption of drugs from the small bowel (7.3) Insulin: Changes in food transit time may require adjustment of insulin dose or timing to avoid hypoglycemia (7.4) Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and Neuroleptics: Concomitant use with metoclopramide is associated with increased risk of tardive dyskinesia and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (7.5) 7.1 Anticholinergic and Narcotic Analgesic Drugs The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Metoclopramide has been shown to release catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggesting that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. 7.3 Drug Absorption Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished by metoclopramide (e.g., digoxin), whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). 7.4 Insulin Because the action of metoclopramide will hasten the movement of food to the intestines and therefore the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment. Increasing movement of food to the intestines may lead to absorption of less glucose from a meal, hence less glucose in the circulation for a particular dose of administered insulin to act upon, resulting in hypoglycemia. 7.5 Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and Neuroleptics Concomitant use of metoclopramide should be avoided in patients taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and/or neuroleptics that have been associated with extrapyramidal reactions such as tardive dyskinesia or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) that have occurred in association with metoclopramide [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), ( 5.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]."$$

Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Cardiovascular Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure, and possible atrioventricular (AV) block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Gastrointestinal Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without a clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE). Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults. Allergic Reactions A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema. Miscellaneous Visual disturbances, Porphyria. Transient flushing of the face and upper body, without alterations in vital signs, following high doses intravenously."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlates with the dose and duration of metoclopramide administration. The following reactions have been reported, although in most instances, data do not permit an estimate of frequency: CNS Effects Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude may occur in patients receiving the recommended prescribed dosage of metoclopramide injection USP. Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation also may occur (see WARNINGS ). In cancer chemotherapy patients being treated with 1-2 mg/kg per dose, incidence of drowsiness is about 70%. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clear-cut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS) Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. In cancer chemotherapy patients receiving 1-2 mg/kg per dose, the incidence is 2% in patients over the ages of 30-35, and 25% or higher in pediatric patients and adult patients less than 30 years of age who have not had prophylactic administration of diphenhydramine. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and, rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS ). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS ). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS ). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability (see WARNINGS ). Endocrine Disturbances Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTIONS ).

(see PRECAUTIONS ). Insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, or mental depression with suicidal ideation (see WARNINGS ) occur less frequently. The incidence of drowsiness is greater at higher doses. There are isolated reports of convulsive seizures without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Rarely, hallucinations have been reported. Extrapyramidal Reactions (EPS): Acute dystonic reactions, the most common type of EPS associated with metoclopramide, occur in approximately 0.2% of patients (1 in 500) treated with 30 to 40 mg of metoclopramide per day. Symptoms include involuntary movements of limbs, facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, opisthotonus (tetanus-like reactions), and, rarely, stridor and dyspnea possibly due to laryngospasm; ordinarily these symptoms are readily reversed by diphenhydramine (see WARNINGS ). Parkinsonian-like symptoms may include bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, mask-like facies (see WARNINGS ). Tardive dyskinesia most frequently is characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth, or jaw, and sometimes by involuntary movements of the trunk and/or extremities; movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance (see WARNINGS ). Motor restlessness (akathisia) may consist of feelings of anxiety, agitation, jitteriness, and insomnia, as well as inability to sit still, pacing, foot tapping. These symptoms may disappear spontaneously or respond to a reduction in dosage. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Rare occurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported. This potentially fatal syndrome is comprised of the symptom complex of hyperthermia, altered consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (see WARNINGS ). Endocrine Disturbances: Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence secondary to hyperprolactinemia (see PRECAUTlONS ). Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, fluid retention, acute congestive heart failure and possible AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Gastrointestinal: Nausea and bowel disturbances, primarily diarrhea. Hepatic: Rarely, cases of hepatotoxicity, characterized by such findings as jaundice and altered liver function tests, when metoclopramide was administered with other drugs with known hepatotoxic potential. Renal: Urinary frequency and incontinence. Hematologic: A few cases of neutropenia, leukopenia, or agranulocytosis, generally without clearcut relationship to metoclopramide. Methemoglobinemia, in adults and especially with overdosage in neonates (see OVERDOSAGE ). Sulfhemoglobinemia in adults. Allergic Reactions: A few cases of rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, especially in patients with a history of asthma. Rarely, angioneurotic edema, including glossal or laryngeal edema. Miscellaneous: Visual disturbances. Porphyria."$$

"Drug Interactions The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics. Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers. The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment."$$
