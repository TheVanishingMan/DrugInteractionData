"ADVERSE REACTIONS Moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in more than 1140 patients with hypertension with more than 120 treated for more than one year. Moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide has not demonstrated a potential for causing adverse experiences different from those previously associated with other ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was slightly less in patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide than patients treated with placebo. Adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between adverse experiences and gender, race, age, or total daily dosage (except for serum potassium decreases at 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) within the moexipril/hydrochlorothiazide dosage range of 3.75 mg/3.125 mg to 30 mg/50 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse experiences was required in 5.3% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and in 8.4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide were cough (0.5%) and dizziness (0.5%). All adverse experiences considered at least possibly related to treatment that occurred at any dose in placebo-controlled trials of once-daily dosing in more than 1% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and that were at least as frequent in the moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide group as in the placebo group are shown in the following table.

All adverse experiences considered at least possibly related to treatment that occurred at any dose in placebo-controlled trials of once-daily dosing in more than 1% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride alone and that were at least as frequent in the moexipril hydrochloride group as in the placebo group are shown in the following table: ADVERSE EVENTS IN PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES ADVERSE EVENT MOEXIPRIL HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS PLACEBO (n=674) (n=226) N (%) N (%) Cough Increased 41 (6.1) 5 (2.2) Dizziness 29 (4.3) 5 (2.2) Diarrhea 21 (3.1) 5 (2.2) Flu Syndrome 21 (3.1) 0 (0) Fatigue 16 (2.4) 4 (1.8) Pharyngitis 12 (1.8) 2 (0.9) Flushing 11 (1.6) 0 (0) Rash 11 (1.6) 2 (0.9) Myalgia 9 (1.3) 0 (0) Other adverse events occurring in more than 1% of patients on moexipril that were at least as frequent on placebo include: headache, upper respiratory infection, pain, rhinitis, dyspepsia, nausea, peripheral edema, sinusitis, chest pain, and urinary frequency. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS for discussion of anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, hypotension, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, second and third trimester fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality, hyperkalemia, and cough. Other potentially important adverse experiences reported in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials in less than 1% of moexipril patients or that have been attributed to other ACE inhibitors include the following: Cardiovascular: Symptomatic hypotension, postural hypotension, or syncope were seen in 9/1750 (0.51%) patients; these reactions led to discontinuation of therapy in controlled trials in 3/1254 (0.24%) patients who had received moexipril hydrochloride monotherapy and in 1/344 (0.3%) patients who had received moexipril hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide (see PRECAUTIONS and WARNINGS). Other adverse events included angina/myocardial infarction, palpitations, rhythm disturbances, and cerebrovascular accident. Renal: Of hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal disease, 1% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride alone and 2% of patients receiving moexipril hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide experienced increases in serum creatinine to at least 140% of their baseline values (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, appetite/weight change, dry mouth, pancreatitis, hepatitis. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, dyspnea, eosinophilic pneumonitis. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, oliguria. Dermatologic: Apparent hypersensitivity reactions manifested by urticaria, rash, pemphigus, pruritus, photosensitivity, alopecia. Neurological and Psychiatric: Drowsiness, sleep disturbances, nervousness, mood changes, anxiety. Other: Angioedema (see WARNINGS ), taste disturbances, tinnitus, sweating, malaise, arthralgia, hemolytic anemia. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS), hyponatremia. Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen: As with other ACE inhibitors, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in approximately 1% of patients with essential hypertension who were treated with moexipril hydrochloride. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with compromised renal function (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Other (causal relationship unknown): Clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with moexipril hydrochloride administration. Elevations of liver enzymes and uric acid have been reported. In trials, less than 1% of moexipril-treated patients discontinued moexipril hydrochloride treatment because of laboratory abnormalities. The incidence of abnormal laboratory values with moexipril was similar to that in the placebo-treated group."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in more than 1140 patients with hypertension with more than 120 treated for more than one year. Moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide has not demonstrated a potential for causing adverse experiences different from those previously associated with other ACE inhibitor/diuretic combinations. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was slightly less in patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide than patients treated with placebo. Adverse experiences were usually mild and transient, and there was no relationship between adverse experiences and gender, race, age, or total daily dosage (except for serum potassium decreases at 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) within the moexipril/hydrochlorothiazide dosage range of 3.75 mg/3.125 mg to 30 mg/50 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse experiences was required in 5.3% of patients treated with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide and in 8.4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide were cough (0.5%) and dizziness (0.5%).

"Drug Interactions Diuretics Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started. The possibility of hypotensive effects with moexipril hydrochloride can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with moexipril hydrochloride. If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexipril should be reduced (see and ). WARNINGS DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Moexipril hydrochloride can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. Oral Anticoagulants Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may be attenuated by NSAIDS. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on moexipril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Other Agents No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when moexipril hydrochloride was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine. Moexipril hydrochloride has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H blockers, digoxin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents.

"Drug Interactions Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: As noted above (Serum Electrolyte Imbalances), the net effect of moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. Oral Anticoagulants: Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect of moexipril monotherapy on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flusing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients on thiazide diuretic therapy with concomitant use of alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics. Antidiabetic Agents: Use of thiazide diuretics concomitantly with antidiabetic agents (oral agents and insulin) may require dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic agent. Moexipril has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with oral hypoglycemic agents and there was no evidence of any clinically important adverse interactions. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH: Use of thiazide diuretics concomitantly with corticosteroids or ACTH may intensify electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines: Thiazide diuretics may decrease arterial responsiveness to pressor amines (e.g. norepinephrine), but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing: Thiazide diuretics may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy.

Moexipril has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2 blockers, digoxin, and cholesterol-lowering agents. There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. In general, ACE inhibitors have less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both work by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Coadministration of propantheline or guanabenz increased the absorption of hydrochlorothiazide."$$

Moexipril has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with oral hypoglycemic agents and there was no evidence of any clinically important adverse interactions. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH: Use of thiazide diuretics concomitantly with corticosteroids or ACTH may intensify electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines: Thiazide diuretics may decrease arterial responsiveness to pressor amines (e.g. norepinephrine), but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing: Thiazide diuretics may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide, as well as the diuretic and natriuretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide, may be attenuated by NSAIDS. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Other Agents: No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when moexipril was administered concomitantly with digoxin or cimetidine. Moexipril has been used in clinical trials concomitantly with calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, H2 blockers, digoxin, and cholesterol-lowering agents. There was no evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. In general, ACE inhibitors have less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both work by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Coadministration of propantheline or guanabenz increased the absorption of hydrochlorothiazide."$$
"Drug Interactions Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics As noted above (Serum Electrolyte Imbalances), the net effect of moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. Oral Anticoagulants Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect of moexipril monotherapy on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients on thiazide diuretic therapy with concomitant use of alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics. Antidiabetic Agents Use of thiazide diuretics concomitantly with antidiabetic agents (oral agents and insulin) may require dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic agent.
