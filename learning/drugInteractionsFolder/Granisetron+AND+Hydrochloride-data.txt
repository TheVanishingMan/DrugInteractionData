        "Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic, this may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (see WARNINGS)."

Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (> 2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (>= 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Akorn, Inc. at 1-800-932-5676 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials - Single-Day Chemotherapy *Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. Percent of Patients With Event Granisetron Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator* (n-422) Headache Constipation 14% 3% 6% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P <0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Contains benzyl alcohol (5.5) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotogenic drugs. (5.4) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patient should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interaction (7), Patient Counseling Information (17.4)]. 5.5 Benzyl Alcohol Granisetron hydrochloride injection, USP 1 mg/mL contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol, a component of granisetron hydrochloride injection, USP 1 mg/mL, has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death, particularly in neonates. The \"gasping syndrome,\" characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and metabolites in blood and urine, has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome,\" the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7)]. Most common adverse reactions: -Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>= 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials — Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg / kg (n=1268) Comparator Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron is uncertain. Hepatic In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Granisetron does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) -QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) -Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) -Serotonin syndrome has been reported with other granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.4) -Contains benzyl alcohol. (5.5) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron. Therefore, granisetron should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagoinist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7), PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17)]. 5.5 Benzyl Alcohol Granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg/mL contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol, a component of granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg/mL, has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death, particularly in neonates. The \"gasping syndrome,\" characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and metabolites in blood and urine, has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the \"gasping syndrome,\" the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24 hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials—Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator1 (n=422) 1Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1 , were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride injection is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with other granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.4) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (eg. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences.

ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Limited at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials-Single-Day Chemotherapy 1Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg / kg ( n = 1268 ) Comparator1 ( n = 422 ) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1 , were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.4) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (eg. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of sign and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride injection in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride injection. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride injection.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC. at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials-Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator1 (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% 1Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/ dexamethasone. Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride injection is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride injection exposure.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs. However, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer therapies. In agreement with these data, no clinically relevant drug interactions have been reported in clinical studies with Sancuso. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1 and CYP3A4), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and hence, the half-life of granisetron. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ProStrakan Inc. at 1-800-SANCUSO, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety of Sancuso was evaluated in a total of 404 patients undergoing chemotherapy who participated in two double-blind, comparator studies with patch treatment durations of up to 7 days. The control groups included a total of 406 patients who received a daily dose of 2 mg oral granisetron, for 1 to 5 days. Adverse reactions considered by the investigators as drug-related occurred in 8.7% (35/404) of patients receiving Sancuso and 7.1% (29/406) of patients receiving oral granisetron. The most common adverse reaction was constipation that occurred in 5.4% of patients in the Sancuso group and 3.0% of patients in the oral granisetron group. Table 1 lists the treatment emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of patients treated with Sancuso or oral granisetron. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Active Comparator Controlled Studies in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy (Events >= 3% in either group) Body System Preferred Term Sancuso TDS N=404 (%) Oral granisetron N=406 (%) Gastrointestinal disorders Constipation 5.4 3.0 Nervous system disorders Headache 0.7 3.0 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as granisetron, may be associated with arrhythmias or ECG abnormalities. Three ECGs were performed on 588 randomized patients in the Phase 3 study: at baseline before treatment, the first day of chemotherapy, and 5 to 7 days after starting chemotherapy. QTcF prolongation greater than 450 milliseconds was seen in a total of 11 (1.9%) patients after receiving granisetron, 8 (2.7%) on oral granisetron and 3 (1.1%) on the patch. No new QTcF prolongation greater than 480 milliseconds was observed in any patient in this study. No arrhythmias were detected in this study. Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials with other formulations of granisetron include the following: Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, elevation of ALT and AST levels, nausea and vomiting Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation and syncope have been observed rarely Central Nervous System: dizziness, insomnia, headache, anxiety, somnolence and asthenia Hypersensitivity: rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported Other: fever; events often associated with chemotherapy have also been reported: leucopenia, decreased appetite, anemia, alopecia, thrombocytopenia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Sancuso. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions (pain, pruritus, erythema, rash, irritation, vesicles, burn, discoloration, urticaria); patch non-adhesion Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia, chest pain, palpitations, sick sinus syndrome"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention caused by the underlying condition. (5.1) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.2) Mild application site reactions have occurred; remove patch if severe reactions or a generalized skin reaction occur. (5.3) Avoid exposing the granisetron patch and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads (5.4) Avoid direct exposure of application site to natural or artificial sunlight by covering with clothing while wearing the patch and for 10 days after removing it. (5.5) 5.1 Gastrointestinal The use of granisetron in patients may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention caused by the underlying condition. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Sancuso and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Sancuso and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Sancuso is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs. [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17.4)]. 5.3 Skin Reactions In clinical trials with Sancuso, application site reactions were reported which were generally mild in intensity and did not lead to discontinuation of use. The incidence of reactions was comparable with placebo. If severe reactions, or a generalized skin reaction occur (e.g. allergic rash, including erythematous, macular, papular rash or pruritus), the patch must be removed. 5.4 External Heat Sources A heat pad should not be applied over or in vicinity of Sancuso patch. Patients should avoid prolonged exposure to heat as plasma concentration continues increasing during the period of heat exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Exposure to Sunlight Granisetron may be affected by direct natural or artificial sunlight. Patients must be advised to cover the patch application site, e.g. with clothing, if there is a risk of exposure to sunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days following its removal because of a potential skin reaction (see Section 13.2)."

Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were: Gastrointestinal: In single-day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days, nausea (20%) and vomiting (12%) were recorded as adverse events after the 24 hour efficacy assessment period. Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%).

Table 4 Principal Adverse Events in Clinical Trials Percent of Patients With Event Granisetron HCl1 Tablets 1 mg twice a day (n=978) Granisetron HCl1 Tablets 2 mg once a day (n=1450) Comparator2 (n=599) Placebo (n=185) Headache* 21% 20% 13% 12% Constipation 18% 14% 16% 8% Asthenia 14% 18% 10% 4% Diarrhea 8% 9% 10% 4% Abdominal pain 6% 4% 6% 3% Dyspepsia 4% 6% 5% 4% 1 Adverse events were recorded for 7 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given on a single day and for up to 28 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were administered for 7 or 14 days. 2 Metoclopramide/dexamethasone; phenothiazines/dexamethasone; dexamethasone alone; prochlorperazine. * Usually mild to moderate in severity. Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were: Gastrointestinal: In single-day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days, nausea (20%) and vomiting (12%) were recorded as adverse events after the 24-hour efficacy assessment period. Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (>= 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration.

In the absence of a placebo group, there is uncertainty as to how many of these events should be attributed to granisetron hydrochloride, except for headache, which was clearly more frequent than in comparison groups. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In controlled clinical trials, the adverse events reported by patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiation were similar to those reported by patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets prior to chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, asthenia, and constipation. Headache, however, was less prevalent in this patient population. Postmarketing Experience QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride (see PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions )."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro . There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro . In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications. (7) Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. (7) Inducers or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes may change the clearance and therefore the half-life of granisetron.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)] . Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) Postoperative nausea and vomiting (>= 2%): Pain, headache, fever, abdominal pain and hepatic enzymes increased (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Vigilance & Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1: Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials — Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1,268) Comparator 1 (n=422) Headache Constipation 14% 3% 6% 3% 1Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/dexamethasone. Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P <0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions listed in Table 2 were reported in >= 2% of adults receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg during controlled clinical trials. Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials in Postoperative Nausea a nd Vomiting (Reported in >= 2% of Adults Receiving Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg) Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg (n=267) Placebo (n=266) Pain 10.1 8.3 Headache 8.6 7.1 Fever 7.9 4.5 Abdominal Pain 6 6 Hepatic Enzymes Increased 5.6 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 3.4 Diarrhea 3.4 1.1 Flatulence 3 3 Dyspepsia 3 1.9 Oliguria 2.2 1.5 Coughing 2.2 1.1 Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were constipation, anemia, insomnia, bradycardia, leukocytosis, anxiety, hypotension, infection, hypertension, and urinary tract infection. In a clinical study conducted in Japan, the types of adverse events differed notably from those reported above in Table 2. The adverse events in the Japanese study that occurred in >= 2% of patients and were more frequent with granisetron hydrochloride injection 1 mg than with placebo were: fever (56% to 50%), sputum increased (2.7% to 1.7%), and dermatitis (2.7% to 0%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ].",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with other granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.4) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17.1)] .",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) Contains benzyl alcohol. (5.4) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with granisetron products, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. (5.5) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists 5.4 Benzyl Alcohol Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg/mL contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol, a component of Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 1 mg/mL, has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death, particularly in neonates. The "gasping syndrome," characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and metabolites in blood and urine, has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the "gasping syndrome," the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low birth-weight infants, as well as patients receiving high dosages, may be more likely to develop toxicity. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. 5.5 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, granisetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron hydrochloride injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride injection in vitro. In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride injection. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride injection. The clinical significance of this change is not known. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection. Use of granisetron hydrochloride injection in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences. Granisetron hydrochloride injection has been administered safely with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and anti-ulcer medications. (7) Does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Most common adverse reactions: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (>=3%): Headache, and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC. at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The following have been reported during controlled clinical trials or in the routine management of patients. The percentage figures are based on clinical trial experience only. Table 1 gives the comparative frequencies of the two most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Reactions were generally recorded over seven days post-granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. Table 1 Principal Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials-Single-Day Chemotherapy Percent of Patients With Reaction Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection 40 mcg/kg (n=1268) Comparator1 (n=422) Headache 14% 6% Constipation 3% 3% 1Metoclopramide/dexamethasone and phenothiazines/ dexamethasone. Additional adverse events reported in clinical trials were asthenia, somnolence and diarrhea. In over 3,000 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection (2 to 160 mcg/kg) in single-day and multiple-day clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies, adverse events, other than those adverse reactions listed in Table 1, were observed; attribution of many of these events to granisetron hydrochloride injection is uncertain. Hepatic: In comparative trials, mainly with cisplatin regimens, elevations of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following administration of granisetron hydrochloride injection occurred in 2.8% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2.1%; ALT: 2.4%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (2%); hypotension, arrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, varying degrees of A-V block, ventricular ectopy including non-sustained tachycardia, and ECG abnormalities have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, CNS stimulation and insomnia were seen in less than 2% of patients. Extrapyramidal syndrome occurred rarely and only in the presence of other drugs associated with this syndrome. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (eg, anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (3%), taste disorder (2%), skin rashes (1%). In multiple-day comparative studies, fever occurred more frequently with granisetron hydrochloride injection (8.6%) than with comparative drugs (3.4%, P<0.014), which usually included dexamethasone. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of granisetron hydrochloride injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to granisetron hydrochloride injection exposure. QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Granisetron hydrochloride injection does not stimulate gastric or intestinal peristalsis and should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. (5.1) QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria, may occur in patients with known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. (5.3) 5.1 Gastric or Intestinal Peristalsis Granisetron hydrochloride injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of granisetron hydrochloride injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distention. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events An adequate QT assessment has not been conducted, but QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride injection. Therefore, granisetron hydrochloride injection should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders, as this might lead to clinical consequences. Patients with cardiac disease, on cardio-toxic chemotherapy, with concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and/or on concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval are particularly at risk. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (eg. anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) may occur in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.",

Hepatic: In comparative trials, elevation of AST and ALT (>2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets USP occurred in 5% and 6% of patients, respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%; ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%); hypotension, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%). One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets USP. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, hypotension, urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%), decreased appetite (6%), anemia (4%), alopecia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride USP in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (>=3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection USP, 40 mcg/kg, in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy, primarily cisplatin, and intravenous fluids during the 24-hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection USP administration.
