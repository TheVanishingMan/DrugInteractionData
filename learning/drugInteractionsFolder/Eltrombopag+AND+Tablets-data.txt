        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 are involved in the metabolism of eltrombopag. In vitro, eltrombopag inhibits the following metabolic or transporter systems: CYP2C8, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, OATP1B1, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. PROMACTA must not be taken within 4 hours of any medications or products containing polyvalent cations such as antacids, calcium-rich foods, and mineral supplements. (2.4, 7.1) 7.1 Polyvalent Cations (Chelation) Eltrombopag chelates polyvalent cations (such as iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, and zinc) in foods, mineral supplements, and antacids. In a clinical trial, administration of PROMACTA with a polyvalent cation-containing antacid decreased plasma eltrombopag systemic exposure by approximately 70% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. PROMACTA must not be taken within 4 hours of any medications or products containing polyvalent cations such as antacids, dairy products, and mineral supplements to avoid significant reduction in absorption of PROMACTA due to chelation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 7.2 Transporters Coadministration of PROMACTA with the OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate, rosuvastatin, to healthy adult subjects increased plasma rosuvastatin AUC0-∞ by 55% and Cmax by 103% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution when concomitantly administering PROMACTA and drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g., atorvastatin, bosentan, ezetimibe, fluvastatin, glyburide, olmesartan, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, repaglinide, rifampin, simvastatin acid, SN-38 [active metabolite of irinotecan], valsartan) or BCRP (e.g., imatinib, irinotecan, lapatinib, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, topotecan). Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of excessive exposure to the drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 or BCRP and consider reduction of the dose of these drugs, if appropriate. In clinical trials with PROMACTA, a dose reduction of rosuvastatin by 50% was recommended. 7.3 Protease Inhibitors HIV Protease Inhibitors: In a drug interaction trial, coadministration of PROMACTA with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) decreased plasma eltrombopag exposure by 17% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is recommended when PROMACTA is coadministered with LPV/RTV. Drug interactions with other HIV protease inhibitors have not been evaluated. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors: Coadministration of PROMACTA with either boceprevir or telaprevir did not affect eltrombopag or protease inhibitor exposure significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustments are recommended. Drug interactions with other HCV protease inhibitors have not been evaluated. 7.4 Peginterferon alfa-2a/b Therapy Coadministration of peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS(R)) or 2b (PEGINTRON(R)) did not affect eltrombopag exposure in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with adult patients with chronic hepatitis C [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions associated with PROMACTA are described in other sections. -Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -In adult patients with ITP, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo) were: nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, increased ALT, myalgia, and urinary tract infection. (6.1) -In pediatric patients age 6 years and older with ITP, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 10% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and rhinitis. (6.1) -In patients with chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 10% and greater than placebo) were: anemia, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, influenza-like illness, asthenia, insomnia, cough, pruritus, chills, myalgia, alopecia, and peripheral edema. (6.1) -In patients with severe aplastic anemia, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were: nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, and headache.

Chronic Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia: Adults: In clinical trials, hemorrhage was the most common serious adverse reaction and most hemorrhagic reactions followed discontinuation of PROMACTA. Other serious adverse reactions included thrombotic/thromboembolic complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The data described below reflect exposure of PROMACTA to 446 patients with chronic ITP aged 18 to 85 years, of whom 65% were female, across the ITP clinical development program including three placebo-controlled trials. PROMACTA was administered to 277 patients for at least 6 months and 202 patients for at least 1 year. Table 4 presents the most common adverse drug reactions (experienced by greater than or equal to 3% of patients receiving PROMACTA) from the three placebo-controlled trials, with a higher incidence in PROMACTA versus placebo. Table 4. Adverse Reactions (>=3%) from Three Placebo-controlled Trials in Adults with Chronic Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia Adverse Reaction PROMACTA 50 mg n = 241 (%) Placebo n = 128 (%) Nausea 9 3 Diarrhea 9 7 Upper respiratory tract infection 7 6 Vomiting 6 <1 Increased ALT 5 3 Myalgia 5 2 Urinary tract infection 5 3 Oropharyngeal pain 4 3 Increased AST 4 2 Pharyngitis 4 2 Back pain 3 2 Influenza 3 2 Paresthesia 3 2 Rash 3 2 In the three controlled clinical chronic ITP trials, alopecia, musculoskeletal pain, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, and dry mouth were the adverse reactions reported in 2% of patients treated with PROMACTA and in no patients who received placebo. Among 299 patients with chronic ITP who received PROMACTA in the single-arm extension trial, the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to that seen in the placebo-controlled trials. Table 5 presents the most common treatment-related adverse reactions (experienced by greater than or equal to 3% of patients receiving PROMACTA) from the extension trial. Table 5. Treatment-related Adverse Reactions (>=3%) from Extension Trial in Adults with Chronic Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia Adverse Reaction PROMACTA 50 mg n = 299 (%) Headache 10 Hyperbilirubinemia 6 ALT increased 6 Cataract 5 AST increased 4 Fatigue 4 Nausea 4 In the three controlled chronic ITP trials, serum liver test abnormalities (predominantly Grade 2 or less in severity) were reported in 11% and 7% of patients for PROMACTA and placebo, respectively. Four patients (1%) treated with PROMACTA and three patients in the placebo group (2%) discontinued treatment due to hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities. Seven of the patients treated with PROMACTA in the controlled trials with hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities were re-exposed to PROMACTA in the extension trial. Six of these patients again experienced liver test abnormalities (predominantly Grade 1) resulting in discontinuation of PROMACTA in one patient. In the extension chronic ITP trial, one additional patient had PROMACTA discontinued due to liver test abnormalities (less than or equal to Grade 3). In a placebo-controlled trial of PROMACTA in patients with chronic liver diseaseand thrombocytopenia not related to ITP, six patients treated with PROMACTA and one patient in the placebo group developed portal vein thromboses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Pediatric Patients: The data described below reflect median exposure to PROMACTA of 91 days for 82 pediatric patients (aged 6 to 17 years) with chronic ITP, of whom 52% were female, across the randomized phase of two placebo-controlled trials. Table 6 presents the most common adverse drug reactions (experienced by greater than or equal to 3% of pediatric patients 6 years and older receiving PROMACTA) across the two placebo-controlled trials, with a higher incidence for PROMACTA versus placebo. Table 6.

Chronic Hepatitis C-associated Thrombocytopenia: In the two placebo-controlled trials, 955 patients with chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia received PROMACTA. Table 7 presents the most common adverse drug reactions (experienced by greater than or equal to 10% of patients receiving PROMACTA compared with placebo). Table 7. Adverse Reactions (>=10% and Greater than Placebo) from Two Placebo-controlled Trials in Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Adverse Reaction PROMACTA + Peginterferon/Ribavirin n = 955 (%) Placebo + Peginterferon/Ribavirin n = 484 (%) Anemia 40 35 Pyrexia 30 24 Fatigue 28 23 Headache 21 20 Nausea 19 14 Diarrhea 19 11 Decreased appetite 18 14 Influenza-like illness 18 16 Asthenia 16 13 Insomnia 16 15 Cough 15 12 Pruritus 15 13 Chills 14 9 Myalgia 12 10 Alopecia 10 6 Peripheral edema 10 5 In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C, hyperbilirubinemia was reported in 8% of patients receiving PROMACTA compared with 3% for placebo. Total bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 x ULN was reported in 76% and 50% of patients receiving PROMACTA and placebo, respectively. ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3 x ULN was reported in 34% and 38% of patients for PROMACTA and placebo, respectively. Severe Aplastic Anemia: In the single-arm, open-label trial, 43 patients with severe aplastic anemia received PROMACTA. Eleven patients (26%) were treated for greater than 6 months and 7 patients (16%) were treated for greater than 1 year. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) were nausea, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, and headache. Table 8.

Eight patients had a new cytogenetic abnormality reported on therapy, including 5 patients who had complex changes in chromosome 7. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PROMACTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Vascular Disorders: Thrombotic microangiopathy with acute renal failure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function before and during therapy. (5.2) -Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications: Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving PROMACTA. Monitor platelet counts regularly. (5.3) 5.1 Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may increase the risk of hepatic decompensation. In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, ascites and encephalopathy occurred more frequently on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals (7%) than the placebo plus antivirals arm (4%). Patients with low albumin levels (less than 3.5 g/dL) or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score greater than or equal to 10 at baseline had a greater risk for hepatic decompensation on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals. Discontinue PROMACTA if antiviral therapy is discontinued. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity PROMACTA can cause liver enzyme elevations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of PROMACTA, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase, and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. PROMACTA inhibits UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If bilirubin is elevated, perform fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are confirmed, monitor serum liver tests weekly until resolved or stabilized. Discontinue PROMACTA if ALT levels increase to greater than or equal to 3 x ULN in patients with normal liver function or greater than or equal to 3 x baseline in patients with pre-treatment elevations in transaminases and are: -progressively increasing, or -persistent for greater than or equal to 4 weeks, or -accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or -accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with PROMACTA is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then consider cautiously reintroducing PROMACTA and measure serum liver tests weekly during the dose adjustment phase. Hepatotoxicity may reoccur if PROMACTA is reinitiated. If liver test abnormalities persist, worsen or recur, then permanently discontinue PROMACTA. 5.3 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, 3% (31/955) treated with PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic event compared with 1% (5/484) on placebo. The majority of events were of the portal venous system (1% in patients treated with PROMACTA versus less than 1% for placebo). Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with PROMACTA. Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications included both venous and arterial events and were observed at low and at normal platelet counts. Consider the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolism when administering PROMACTA to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use PROMACTA in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain target platelet counts [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]. In a controlled trial in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia not related to ITP undergoing elective invasive procedures (N = 292), the risk of thrombotic events was increased in patients treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily. Seven thrombotic complications (six patients) were reported in the group that received PROMACTA and three thrombotic complications were reported in the placebo group (two patients). All of the thrombotic complications reported in the group that received PROMACTA were portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Symptoms of PVT included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Five of the six patients in the group that received PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with PROMACTA and at a platelet count above 200 x 109/L. The risk of portal venous thrombosis was increased in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. 5.4 Cataracts In the three controlled clinical trials in adults with chronic ITP, cataracts developed or worsened in 15 (7%) patients who received 50 mg of PROMACTA daily and 8 (7%) placebo-group patients. In the extension trial, cataracts developed or worsened in 4% of patients who underwent ocular examination prior to therapy with PROMACTA. In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, cataracts developed or worsened in 8% patients treated with PROMACTA and 5% patients treated with placebo. Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Perform a baseline ocular examination prior to administration of PROMACTA and, during therapy with PROMACTA, regularly monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cataracts."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function before and during therapy. (5.2) -Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications: Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving PROMACTA. Monitor platelet counts regularly. (5.3) 5.1 Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may increase the risk of hepatic decompensation. In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, ascites and encephalopathy occurred more frequently on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals (7%) than the placebo plus antivirals arm (4%). Patients with low albumin levels (less than 3.5 g/dL) or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score greater than or equal to 10 at baseline had a greater risk for hepatic decompensation on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals. Discontinue PROMACTA if antiviral therapy is discontinued. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity PROMACTA can cause liver enzyme elevations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of PROMACTA, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase, and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. PROMACTA inhibits UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If bilirubin is elevated, perform fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are confirmed, monitor serum liver tests weekly until resolved or stabilized. Discontinue PROMACTA if ALT levels increase to greater than or equal to 3 x ULN in patients with normal liver function or greater than or equal to 3 x baseline in patients with pre-treatment elevations in transaminases and are: progressively increasing, or persistent for greater than or equal to 4 weeks, or accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with PROMACTA is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then consider cautiously reintroducing PROMACTA and measure serum liver tests weekly during the dose adjustment phase. Hepatotoxicity may reoccur if PROMACTA is reinitiated. If liver test abnormalities persist, worsen, or recur, then permanently discontinue PROMACTA. 5.3 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, 3% (31/955) treated with PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic event compared with 1% (5/484) on placebo. The majority of events were of the portal venous system (1% in patients treated with PROMACTA versus less than 1% for placebo). Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with PROMACTA. Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications included both venous and arterial events and were observed at low and at normal platelet counts. Consider the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolism when administering PROMACTA to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use PROMACTA in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain target platelet counts [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]. In a controlled trial in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia not related to ITP undergoing elective invasive procedures (N = 292), the risk of thrombotic events was increased in patients treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily. Seven thrombotic complications (six patients) were reported in the group that received PROMACTA and three thrombotic complications were reported in the placebo group (two patients). All of the thrombotic complications reported in the group that received PROMACTA were portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Symptoms of PVT included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Five of the six patients in the group that received PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with PROMACTA and at a platelet count above 200 x 109/L. The risk of portal venous thrombosis was increased in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures. 5.4 Cataracts In the three controlled clinical trials in adults with chronic ITP, cataracts developed or worsened in 15 (7%) patients who received 50 mg of PROMACTA daily and 8 (7%) placebo-group patients. In the extension trial, cataracts developed or worsened in 4% of patients who underwent ocular examination prior to therapy with PROMACTA. In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, cataracts developed or worsened in 8% of patients treated with PROMACTA and 5% of patients treated with placebo. Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]. Perform a baseline ocular examination prior to administration of PROMACTA and, during therapy with PROMACTA, regularly monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cataracts."
