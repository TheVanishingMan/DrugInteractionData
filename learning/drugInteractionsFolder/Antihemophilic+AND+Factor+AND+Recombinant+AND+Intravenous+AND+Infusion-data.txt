However, during the phase II/III portion of the study, 1 subject with a history of inhibitors exhibited inhibitor activity at 6 months (0.8 Bethesda Units [BU]), which resolved by 9 months. One other subject in this study had detectable Factor VIII inhibitor at baseline (1.26 BU) and exhibited an anamnestic response at 6 months (10.3 BU). During a prospective pharmaco-surveillance study of subjects who received batches of RECOMBINATE containing modestly increased Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell protein levels, none of the 34 treated subjects developed a Factor VIII inhibitor. During the Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) study, 22 of the 73 evaluable subjects developed inhibitors to Factor VIII. Of these, 13 subjects displayed no detectable Factor VIII inhibitors at study exit. Post-Marketing Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions noted in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience. These adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA (version 12.1) System Organ Class (SOC), then by MedDRA coding system Preferred Term in order of severity. BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS: Factor VIII inhibition CARDIAC DISORDERS: Tachycardia, Cyanosis GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS: Vomiting, Abdominal pain GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS: Malaise, Injection site reactions, Chest pain, Chest discomfort IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS: Anaphylactic reaction, Hypersensitivity NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS: Loss of consciousness, Headache, Paresthesia RESPIRATORY, THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS: Dyspnea, Cough, Laryngeal edema SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE DISORDERS: Angioedema, Urticaria, Erythema"
