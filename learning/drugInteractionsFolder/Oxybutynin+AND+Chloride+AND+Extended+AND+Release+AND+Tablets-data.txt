        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated in a total of 580 participants who received oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in 4 clinical trials (429 patients) and four pharmacokinetic studies (151 healthy volunteers). The 429 patients were treated with 5 - 30 mg/day for up to 4.5 months. Three of the 4 clinical trials allowed dose adjustments based on efficacy and adverse events and one was a fixed-dose escalation design. Safety information is provided for 429 patients from these three controlled clinical studies and one open-label study in the first column of Table 2 below. Adverse reactions from two additional fixed-dose, activecontrolled, 12-week treatment duration, postmarketing studies, in which 576 patients were treated with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg/day, are also listed in Table 2 (second column).

The incidence of dry mouth was dose-related. The discontinuation rate for all adverse reactions was 6.8% in the 429 patients from the 4 studies of efficacy and safety who received 5-30 mg/day. The most frequent adverse reactions causing early discontinuation of study medication was nausea (1.9%), while discontinuation due to dry mouth was 1.2%. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported by >= 1 to < 5% of all patients who received oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in the 6 adjustable and fixed-dose efficacy and safety studies. Psychiatric disorders: depression, nervousness, insomnia, confusional state; Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia; Cardiac disorders: palpitations; Vascular disorders: hypertension; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: nasal dryness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, dry throat; Gastrointestinal Disorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal pain, flatulence, vomiting; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: dry skin, pruritus; Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, dysuria; General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, edema peripheral, chest pain. The following adverse reactions were reported by <1% of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets-treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, fluid retention; Vascular disorders: hot flush; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dysphonia; Gastrointestinal Disorders: dysphagia, frequent bowel movements; General disorders and administration site conditions: chest discomfort, thirst. Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), Parkinson's disease (5.2), Myasthenia gravis (5.3), and Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4). Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms.\" 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride were evaluated in a total of 580 participants who received oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in four clinical trials (429 patients) and four pharmacokinetic studies (151 healthy volunteers). The 429 patients were treated with 5 to 30 mg/day for up to 4.5 months. Three of the four clinical trials allowed dose adjustments based on efficacy and adverse events and one was a fixed dose escalation design. Safety information is provided for 429 patients from these three controlled clinical studies and one open-label study in the first column of Table 3 below.

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended-release (5 to 30 mg/day) was evaluated in 774 adult subjects who participated in five double-blind, controlled clinical trials. In four of the five studies, oxybutynin chloride immediate-release (5 to 20 mg/day in 199 subjects) was an active comparator. Adverse reactions reported by >= 1% of subjects are shown in Table 1.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride. (5.2) Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: ° Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2), ° Parkinson's disease (5.2), ° Myasthenia Gravis (5.3), and ° Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy. (5.4) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.5) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. -Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects. (7) -Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin. (7)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) -Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) -Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: oPre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2); oParkinson's disease (5.2); oMyasthenia gravis (5.3); and oDecreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy (5.4). -Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.5) -Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Events with Oxybutynin Chloride Extended-release Tablets The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride was evaluated in a total of 580 participants who received oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets in four clinical trials (429 patients) and four pharmacokinetic studies (151 healthy volunteers). The 429 patients were treated with 5 to 30 mg/day for up to 4.5 months. Three of the four clinical trials allowed dose adjustments based on efficacy and adverse events and one was a fixed dose escalation design. Safety information is provided for 429 patients from these three controlled clinical studies and one open-label study in the first column of Table 3 below. Adverse events from two additional fixed dose, active controlled, 12-week treatment duration, post-marketing studies, in which 576 patients were treated with oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets 10 mg/day, are also listed in Table 3 (second column). The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

(5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) -Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release. (5.2) -Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis: Use with caution in Myasthenia gravis patients due to risk of symptom aggravation. (5.3) -Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.4) -Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.5) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. ( ) 5.1 Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. ( ) 5.2 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis: Use with caution in Myasthenia gravis patients due to risk of symptom aggravation ( ) 5.3 Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( ) 5.4 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. ( ) 5.5 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. [see ] Adverse Reactions (6) Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention . [see ] Contraindications (4) 5.5 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention . [see ] Contraindications (4) Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis: Use with caution in Myasthenia gravis patients due to risk of symptom aggravation (5.3) Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (5.4) Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.5) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation. 5.4 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., Cmax and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are co-administered. Co-administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and/or severity of anticholinergic-like effects.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported with oxybutynin. If symptoms of angioedema occur, discontinue oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. (5.1) -Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: CNS effects have been reported with oxybutynin. If patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) -Use with caution due to aggravation of symptoms: -Pre-existing dementia in patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (5.2); -Parkinson's disease (5.2); -Myasthenia gravis (5.3); and -Decreased gastrointestinal motility in patients with autonomic neuropathy (5.4). -Urinary Retention: Use with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.5) -Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased intestinal motility due to risk of gastric retention. Use with caution in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or in patients concurrently taking drugs that can exacerbate esophagitis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.3 Worsening of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. 5.4 Worsening of Symptoms of Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility in Patients with Autonomic Neuropathy Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. 5.5 Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. As with any other nondeformable material, caution should be used when administering oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Events with Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release TabletsThe safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets was evaluated in a total of 580 participants who received Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets in 4 clinical trials (429 patients) and four pharmacokinetic studies (151 healthy volunteers). The 429 patients were treated with 5-30 mg/day for up to 4.5 months. Three of the 4 clinical trials allowed dose adjustments based on efficacy and adverse events and one was a fixed dose escalation design. Safety information is provided for 429 patients from these three controlled clinical studies and one open label study in the first column of Table 3 below. Adverse events from two additional fixed dose, active controlled, 12 week treatment duration, postmarketing studies, in which 576 patients were treated with Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets 10 mg/day, are also listed in Table 3 (second column). The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 3 Incidence (%) of Adverse Events Reported by >= 5% of Patients Using Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets (5-30 mg/day) and % of Corresponding Adverse Events in Two Fixed Dose (10mg/day) Studies Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets Body System Adverse Event 5-30 mg/day (n=429) 10 mg/day (n=576) General headache 10 6 asthenia 7 3 pain 7 4 Digestive dry mouth 61 29 constipation 13 7 diarrhea 9 7 nausea 9 2 dyspepsia 7 5 Nervous somnolence 12 2 dizziness 6 4 Respiratory rhinitis 6 2 Special senses blurred vision 8 1 dry eyes 6 3 Urogenital urinary tract infection 5 5 The most common adverse events reported by the 429 patients receiving 5-30 mg/day Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets were the expected side effects of anticholinergic agents. The incidence of dry mouth was dose-related. The discontinuation rate for all adverse events was 6.8% in the 429 patients from the 4 studies of efficacy and safety who received 5-30 mg/day. The most frequent adverse event causing early discontinuation of study medication was nausea (1.9%), while discontinuation due to dry mouth was 1.2%. In addition, the following adverse events were reported by greater than or equal to 1 to less than 5% of all patients who received Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets in the 6 adjustable and fixed dose efficacy and safety studies. Infections and infestations: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, bronchitis, cystitis; Psychiatric disorders: insomnia, depression, nervousness, confusional state; Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia; Cardiac disorders: palpitations; Vascular disorders: hypertension; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: nasal dryness, cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dry throat; Gastrointestinal Disorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal pain, loose stools, flatulence, vomiting; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: dry skin, pruritis; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: back pain, arthralgia, pain in extremity; Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, dysuria; General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, edema peripheral, asthenia, chest pain; Investigations: blood pressure increased. Postmarketing SurveillanceBecause postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets: Psychiatric Disorders: psychotic disorder, agitation, hallucinations, memory impairment; Nervous System Disorders: convulsions; Cardiac Disorders: arrhythmia; tachycardia, QT interval prolongation; Vascular Disorders: flushing; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash; Renal and Urinary Disorders: impotence; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall.
