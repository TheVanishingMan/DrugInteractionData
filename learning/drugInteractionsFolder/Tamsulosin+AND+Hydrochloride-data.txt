        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with FLOMAX capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg FLOMAX capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with FLOMAX capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with FLOMAX capsules are known. Treatment with FLOMAX capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken FLOMAX capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with FLOMAX capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with FLOMAX capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including FLOMAX capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to FLOMAX capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering FLOMAX capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) ( 5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension ( 5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur ( 5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. ( 5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents ( 5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin ( 5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism ( 5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. ( 5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards ( 5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg are coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis Elizabeth LLC at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1).

Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP.

These studies evaluated safety in 1,783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1,487 men. Table 1: Treatment EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. Adverse Events Occurring in >= 2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies Body System/ Adverse Event Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules Groups Placebo 0.4 mg n = 502 0.8 mg n = 492 n = 493 Body As Whole Headache 97 (19.3%) 104 (21.1%) 99 (20.1%) InfectionCoding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 45 (9%) 53 (10.8%) 37 (7.5%) Asthenia 39 (7.8%) 42 (8.5%) 27 (5.5%) Back Pain 35 (7%) 41 (8.3%) 27 (5.5%) Chest Pain 20 (4%) 20 (4.1%) 18 (3.7%) Nervous System Dizziness 75 (14.9%) 84 (17.1%) 50 (10.1%) Somnolence 15 (3%) 21 (4.3%) 8 (1.6%) Insomnia 12 (2.4%) 7 (1.4%) 3 (0.6%) Libido Decreased 5 (1%) 10 (2%) 6 (1.2%) Respiratory System RhinitisCoding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. 66 (13.1%) 88 (17.9%) 41 (8.3%) Pharyngitis 29 (5.8%) 25 (5.1%) 23 (4.7%) Cough Increased 17 (3.4%) 22 (4.5%) 12 (2.4%) Sinusitis 11 (2.2%) 18 (3.7%) 8 (1.6%) Digestive System Diarrhea 31 (6.2%) 21 (4.3%) 22 (4.5%) Nausea 13 (2.6%) 19 (3.9%) 16 (3.2%) Tooth Disorder 6 (1.2%) 10 (2%) 7 (1.4%) Urogenital System Abnormal Ejaculation 42 (8.4%) 89 (18.1%) 1 (0.2%) Special Senses Blurred Vision 1 (0.2%) 10 (2%) 2 (0.4%) Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "Drug Interactions Section Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GSMS at 1-800-284-8633, Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2 Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3 Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CARACO Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. at 1-800-818-4555, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria:-The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in pacebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents thers a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result sd syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitorf CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other ha adrenergic blocking agentse Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potential cause symptomatic hypotensione Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tulosin hydrochloride capsulese Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patientsmust be advised about the seriousness the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. to report suspected adverse reactions call 1-800-332-1088 to report suspected adverse reactions call 1-800-332-1088"

        "Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules"

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( >= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.3 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.8 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.9 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

(5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2 Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3 Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

(5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent1 Adverse Events Occurring in >=2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies 1A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: -The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. -The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or -The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1,783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1,487 men. Table 1: Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: - The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. Adverse Events Occurring in >= 2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies Body System/ Adverse Event Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules Groups Placebo 0.4 mg n = 502 0.8 mg n = 492 n = 493 Body As Whole Headache 97 (19.3%) 104 (21.1%) 99 (20.1%) InfectionCoding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 45 (9%) 53 (10.8%) 37 (7.5%) Asthenia 39 (7.8%) 42 (8.5%) 27 (5.5%) Back Pain 35 (7%) 41 (8.3%) 27 (5.5%) Chest Pain 20 (4%) 20 (4.1%) 18 (3.7%) Nervous System Dizziness 75 (14.9%) 84 (17.1%) 50 (10.1%) Somnolence 15 (3%) 21 (4.3%) 8 (1.6%) Insomnia 12 (2.4%) 7 (1.4%) 3 (0.6%) Libido Decreased 5 (1%) 10 (2%) 6 (1.2%) Respiratory System RhinitisCoding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. 66 (13.1%) 88 (17.9%) 41 (8.3%) Pharyngitis 29 (5.8%) 25 (5.1%) 23 (4.7%) Cough Increased 17 (3.4%) 22 (4.5%) 12 (2.4%) Sinusitis 11 (2.2%) 18 (3.7%) 8 (1.6%) Digestive System Diarrhea 31 (6.2%) 21 (4.3%) 22 (4.5%) Nausea 13 (2.6%) 19 (3.9%) 16 (3.2%) Tooth Disorder 6 (1.2%) 10 (2%) 7 (1.4%) Urogenital System Abnormal Ejaculation 42 (8.4%) 89 (18.1%) 1 (0.2%) Special Senses Blurred Vision 1 (0.2%) 10 (2%) 2 (0.4%) Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( >= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test.

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Citron Pharma LLC. at 1-855-5-CITRON (1-855-524-8766) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules . Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril In three studies in hypertensive subjects (age range 47-79 years) whose blood pressure was controlled with stable doses of Procardia XL(R), atenolol, or enalapril for at least three months, FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg for seven days followed by FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg for another seven days (n=8 per study) resulted in no clinically significant effects on blood pressure and pulse rate compared to placebo (n=4 per study). Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with Procardia XL(R), atenolol, or enalapril. Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules. Digoxin and Theophylline In two studies in healthy volunteers (n=10 per study; age range 19-39 years) receiving FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg/day for two days, followed by FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg/day for five to eight days, single intravenous doses of digoxin 0.5 mg or theophylline 5 mg/kg resulted in no change in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline. Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline. Furosemide The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between Flomax(R) (tamsulosin hydrochloride) capsules 0.8 mg/day (steady-state) and furosemide 20 mg intravenously (single dose) was evaluated in ten healthy volunteers (age range 21-40 years). FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage. Cytochrome P450 Inhibition: Cimetidine The effects of cimetidine at the highest recommended dose (400 mg every six hours for six days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in ten healthy volunteers (age range 21-38 years). Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%). Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg. Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 The effects of ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) at 400 mg every day on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers (age range from 23 to 47 years). Treatment with ketoconazole resulted in a Cmax and AUC that increased by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. Therefore, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should be used with caution in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Doses above 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). The effects of paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) at 20 mg every day on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 23 healthy volunteers (age range from 23 to 48 years). Treatment with paroxetine resulted in a Cmax and AUC that increased by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received Flomax(R) (tamsulosin hydrochloride) capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope (see WARNINGS ). Abnormal Ejaculation: Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 3, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha-1 blocker therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, General )."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in pacebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents thers a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result sd syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitorf CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other ha adrenergic blocking agentse Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potential cause symptomatic hypotensione Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tulosin hydrochloride capsulese Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patientsmust be advised about the seriousness the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg are coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP -treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, USP."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( >= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test.

At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)] 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)] 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules",

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: 1.seriousness of the reaction, 2.frequency of reporting, or 3.strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 ) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in pacebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents thers a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result sd syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitorf CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose her than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)e Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other ha adrenergic blocking agentse Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potential cause symptomatic hypotensione Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tulosin hydrochloride capsulese Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patientsmust be advised about the seriousness the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with FLOMAX capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with FLOMAX capsules are known. Treatment with FLOMAX capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken FLOMAX capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with FLOMAX capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with FLOMAX capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including FLOMAX capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to FLOMAX capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering FLOMAX capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There have been no drug interaction trials using dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. The following sections reflect information available for the individual components. 7.1 Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitors Dutasteride: Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions, use caution when prescribing a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin: Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6: Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. A similar increase in exposure is expected in poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine: Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Warfarin Dutasteride: Concomitant administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks with warfarin does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the S- or R-warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin: A definitive drug-drug interaction trial between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Tamsulosin: Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Digoxin and Theophylline Dutasteride: Dutasteride does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Tamsulosin: Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Furosemide Tamsulosin: Tamsulosin had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the dose of tamsulosin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Calcium Channel Antagonists Dutasteride: Coadministration of verapamil or diltiazem decreases dutasteride clearance and leads to increased exposure to dutasteride. The change in dutasteride exposure is not considered to be clinically significant. No dosage adjustment of dutasteride is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Cholestyramine Dutasteride: Administration of a single 5 mg dose of dutasteride followed 1 hour later by a 12 g dose of cholestyramine does not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of subjects treated with coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin are ejaculation disorders, impotence, decreased libido, dizziness, and breast disorders. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience There have been no clinical trials conducted with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules; however, the clinical efficacy and safety of coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin, which are individual components of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, have been evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial (the Combination with Alpha-Blocker Therapy, or CombAT, trial). Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. -The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving coadministration therapy (11%) compared with those receiving dutasteride (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy. -Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin and in 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%). In the CombAT trial, over 4,800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride, or coadministration therapy (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) administered once daily in a 4-year double-blind trial. Overall, 1,623 subjects received monotherapy with dutasteride; 1,611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610 subjects received coadministration therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88 years (mean age: 66 years) and 88% were Caucasian. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving coadminstration therapy and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving either dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy.

Cardiac Failure: In CombAT, after 4 years of treatment, the incidence of the composite term cardiac failure in the coadministration group (12/1,610; 0.7%) was higher than in either monotherapy group: dutasteride, 2/1,623 (0.1%) and tamsulosin, 9/1,611 (0.6%). Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating dutasteride in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking dutasteride was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between dutasteride alone or coadministered with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial. Additional information regarding adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with dutasteride or tamsulosin monotherapy follows: Dutasteride: Long-Term Treatment (Up to 4 Years): High-Grade Prostate Cancer: The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (N = 4,126) or 0.5 mg daily doses of dutasteride (N = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were Caucasian. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR(R)), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with dutasteride. Reproductive and Breast Disorders: In the 3 pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with dutasteride, each 4 years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3 trials, there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Tamsulosin: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in two 13-week treatment trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride and at an incidence higher than in subjects receiving placebo were: infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough increased, sinusitis, and diarrhea. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in clinical trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, a positive orthostatic test result was observed in 16% (81/502) of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride versus 11% (54/493) of subjects receiving placebo. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in the tamsulosin-treated subjects than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precaution (5.1) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to drug exposure. Dutasteride: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, localized edema, serious skin reactions, and angioedema. Neoplasms: Male breast cancer. Psychiatric Disorders: Depressed mood. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Testicular pain and testicular swelling. Tamsulosin: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory problems have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Cardiac Disorders: Palpitations, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Skin Disorders: Skin desquamation, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Constipation, vomiting. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Priapism. Vascular Disorders: Hypotension. Ophthalmologic Disorders: During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) associated with alpha adrenergic antagonist therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope can occur. Advise patients of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result if syncope occurs. (5.1) -Do not use dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules with other alpha adrenergic antagonists, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) -Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules reduce serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for untreated men. (5.3) -Do not use dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Use caution in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) or strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors, or known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6. Concomitant use with known inhibitors can cause a marked increase in drug exposure. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant use of PDE-5 inhibitors, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) -Drugs that contain dutasteride, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. (5.4, 6.1) -Prior to initiating treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. (5.5) -Women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules due to potential risk to a male fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.7) -Patients should not donate blood until 6 months after their last dose of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.8) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery after alpha adrenergic antagonist exposure. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they take or have taken dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.9) -Exercise caution with concomitant use of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) 5.1 Orthostatic Hypotension As with other alpha adrenergic antagonists, orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) may occur in patients treated with tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, and can result in syncope. Patients starting treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where syncope could result in an injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Drug-Drug Interactions Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) as this can significantly increase tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should be used with caution when coadministered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine: Caution is advised when tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, are coadministered with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Other Alpha Adrenergic Antagonists: Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not be coadministered with other alpha adrenergic antagonists because of the increased risk of symptomatic hypotension. Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE-5 Inhibitors): Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic antagonist-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, are coadministered with PDE-5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these 2 drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Warfarin: Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection Coadministration of dutasteride with tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as with dutasteride monotherapy. In clinical trials, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. Dutasteride-containing treatment, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, a new baseline PSA should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on a dutasteride-containing treatment, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.4 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR(R)), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume or trial-related factors impacted the results of these trials has not been established. 5.5 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases Prior to initiating treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist. 5.6 Exposure of Women-Risk to Male Fetus Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant. Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure. If a woman who is pregnant or could become pregnant comes in contact with a leaking capsule, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.7 Priapism Priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity) has been associated (probably less than 1 in 50,000) with the use of alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients should be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.8 Blood Donation Men being treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient. 5.9 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha adrenergic antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha adrenergic antagonist had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patients had been off the alpha adrenergic antagonist for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.10 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. 5.11 Effect on Semen Characteristics Dutasteride: The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 (n = 27 dutasteride, n = 23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all time-points remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride's effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known. Tamsulosin: The effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent1 Adverse Events Occurring in >=2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies Body System/Adverse Event Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules Groups Placebo 0.4 mg n=502 0.8 mg n=492 n=493 1 A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2 Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3 Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ ].

Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ ]. Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Table 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in >=2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria:-The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

( ) 5.5 Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards ( ) 5.4 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [ ]. see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.1 see Patient Counseling Information ( ) 17.1 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ ] see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.2 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.3 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.4 12.3 . 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ ]. 1 see Patient Counseling Information ( ) 17.2 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ ]. see Patient Counseling Information ( ) 17.3 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. Intraoperative 1 see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 1 1 1 1 IFIS 1 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). , , (5.2 7.1 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. , , (5.2 7.3 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated . Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively . A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated . The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors . Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) .

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope . Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Abnormal Ejaculation Laboratory Tests 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period.

(5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) .

Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 1 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules . and 1 [see ] Adverse Reactions (6.2) Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. 1 1 1 1 IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. of 1 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1,783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1,487 men. Table 1: Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: - The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. Adverse Events Occurring in >= 2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies Body System/ Adverse Event Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules Groups Placebo 0.4 mg n = 502 0.8 mg n = 492 n = 493 Body As Whole Headache 97 (19.3%) 104 (21.1%) 99 (20.1%) InfectionCoding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 45 (9%) 53 (10.8%) 37 (7.5%) Asthenia 39 (7.8%) 42 (8.5%) 27 (5.5%) Back Pain 35 (7%) 41 (8.3%) 27 (5.5%) Chest Pain 20 (4%) 20 (4.1%) 18 (3.7%) Nervous System Dizziness 75 (14.9%) 84 (17.1%) 50 (10.1%) Somnolence 15 (3%) 21 (4.3%) 8 (1.6%) Insomnia 12 (2.4%) 7 (1.4%) 3 (0.6%) Libido Decreased 5 (1%) 10 (2%) 6 (1.2%) Respiratory System RhinitisCoding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. 66 (13.1%) 88 (17.9%) 41 (8.3%) Pharyngitis 29 (5.8%) 25 (5.1%) 23 (4.7%) Cough Increased 17 (3.4%) 22 (4.5%) 12 (2.4%) Sinusitis 11 (2.2%) 18 (3.7%) 8 (1.6%) Digestive System Diarrhea 31 (6.2%) 21 (4.3%) 22 (4.5%) Nausea 13 (2.6%) 19 (3.9%) 16 (3.2%) Tooth Disorder 6 (1.2%) 10 (2%) 7 (1.4%) Urogenital System Abnormal Ejaculation 42 (8.4%) 89 (18.1%) 1 (0.2%) Special Senses Blurred Vision 1 (0.2%) 10 (2%) 2 (0.4%) Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

(5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis Elizabeth LLC at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2 Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3 Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) ( 5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension ( 5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur ( 5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. ( 5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents ( 5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin ( 5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism ( 5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. ( 5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards ( 5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C max and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C max and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents. (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules . Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha 1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months).

The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) - Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with FLOMAX capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg FLOMAX capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with FLOMAX capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with FLOMAX capsules are known. Treatment with FLOMAX capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken FLOMAX capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with FLOMAX capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with FLOMAX capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including FLOMAX capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to FLOMAX capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering FLOMAX capsules."

        "7.0 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents Warnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [seeWarnings and PrecautionsandClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [seeWarnings and PrecautionsandClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure ofbpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Impax Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-934-6729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.go v/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used.

Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once-daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with FLOMAX capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Furosemide FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg FLOMAX capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with FLOMAX capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with FLOMAX capsules are known. Treatment with FLOMAX capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken FLOMAX capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients beginning treatment with FLOMAX capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. FLOMAX capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with FLOMAX capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including FLOMAX capsules [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to FLOMAX capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering FLOMAX capsules."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: 1.seriousness of the reaction, 2.frequency of reporting, or 3.strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). ( , , ) 5.2 7.1 12.3 Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension ( , , ) 5.2 7.3 12.3 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the C and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ ]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the C and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ ]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ ]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ ]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ ]. Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ ].

Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 5.2 12.3 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited and studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ ]. in vitro in vivo see Warnings and Precautions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 5.2 12.3 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ ]. see Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12.3 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ ]. see Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12.3 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride C and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ ]. max see Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 12.3"

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in >=2% of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria:-The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ ]. Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis see Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5.1 Abnormal Ejaculation Laboratory Tests 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period.

As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [ ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur . see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.1 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [ ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [ ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ ] see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.1 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.2 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.3 12.3 see Drug Interactions ( ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ) 7.4 12.3 . 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 1 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsules [ ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. Intraoperative 1 see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 1 1 1 1 IFIS 1 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>= 2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13 week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1: Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: - The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or - The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once-daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1 ) ]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.2 ) ]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.3 ) ]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg are coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >= 2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13 week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once-daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg are co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mm Hg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria:-The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur . 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloridecapsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Impax Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-934-6729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.go v/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication. The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) - Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS - The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience \\The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]."

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >= 20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >= 10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure < 65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >= 20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >= 100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: seriousness of the reaction, frequency of reporting, or strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]."

As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg FLOMAX capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with FLOMAX capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 3 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred inof patients receiving either FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg, or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure ofbpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received Flomax(tamsulosin hydrochloride) capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope (seeWARNINGS). Abnormal Ejaculation: Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 3, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha-1 blocker therapy (seePRECAUTIONS, General)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There have been no drug interaction trials using JALYN. The following sections reflect information available for the individual components. 7.1 Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitors Dutasteride Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions, use caution when prescribing a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6: Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increases in the Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of tamsulosin by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. A similar increase in exposure is expected in poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine: Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Warfarin Dutasteride Concomitant administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks with warfarin does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the S- or R-warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin A definitive drug-drug interaction trial between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Tamsulosin Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Digoxin and Theophylline Dutasteride Dutasteride does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Furosemide Tamsulosin Tamsulosin had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the dose of tamsulosin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Calcium Channel Antagonists Dutasteride Coadministration of verapamil or diltiazem decreases dutasteride clearance and leads to increased exposure to dutasteride. The change in dutasteride exposure is not considered to be clinically significant. No dosage adjustment of dutasteride is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Cholestyramine Dutasteride Administration of a single 5-mg dose of dutasteride followed 1 hour later by a 12-g dose of cholestyramine does not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of subjects treated with coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin are ejaculation disorders, impotence, decreased libido, dizziness, and breast disorders. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience There have been no clinical trials conducted with JALYN; however, the clinical efficacy and safety of coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin, which are individual components of JALYN, have been evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial (the Combination with Alpha-Blocker Therapy, or CombAT, trial). Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. -The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving coadministration therapy (11%) compared with those receiving dutasteride (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy. -Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin, and in 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%). In the CombAT trial, over 4,800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride, or coadministration therapy (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) administered once daily in a 4-year double-blind trial. Overall, 1,623 subjects received monotherapy with dutasteride; 1,611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610 subjects received coadministration therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88 years (mean age: 66 years) and 88% were white. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving coadministration therapy and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving either dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy.

These adverse reactions may persist after treatment discontinuation. The role of dutasteride in this persistence is unknown. dIncludes erectile dysfunction and disturbance in sexual arousal. eIncludes libido decreased, libido disorder, loss of libido, sexual dysfunction, and male sexual dysfunction. fIncludes breast enlargement, gynecomastia, breast swelling, breast pain, breast tenderness, nipple pain, and nipple swelling. Cardiac Failure In CombAT, after 4 years of treatment, the incidence of the composite term cardiac failure in the coadministration group (12/1,610; 0.7%) was higher than in either monotherapy group: dutasteride, 2/1,623 (0.1%) and tamsulosin, 9/1,611 (0.6%). Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating dutasteride in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking dutasteride was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between dutasteride alone or coadministered with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial. Additional information regarding adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with dutasteride or tamsulosin monotherapy follows. Dutasteride: Long-term Treatment (Up to 4 Years): High-grade Prostate Cancer: The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of dutasteride (n = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with dutasteride. Reproductive and Breast Disorders In the 3 pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with dutasteride, each 4 years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3 trials, there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Tamsulosin According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in two 13-week treatment trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride and at an incidence higher than in subjects receiving placebo were: infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough increased, sinusitis, and diarrhea. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in clinical trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, a positive orthostatic test result was observed in 16% (81/502) of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride versus 11% (54/493) of subjects receiving placebo. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in the tamsulosin-treated subjects than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of JALYN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to drug exposure. Dutasteride: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, localized edema, serious skin reactions, and angioedema. Neoplasms: Male breast cancer. Psychiatric Disorders: Depressed mood. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Testicular pain and testicular swelling. Tamsulosin: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory problems have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Cardiac Disorders: Palpitations, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Skin Disorders: Skin desquamation, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Constipation, vomiting, dry mouth. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Priapism. Respiratory: Epistaxis. Vascular Disorders: Hypotension. Ophthalmologic Disorders: Blurred vision, visual impairment. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) associated with alpha-adrenergic-antagonist therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope can occur. Advise patients of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result if syncope occurs. (5.1) -Do not use JALYN with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) -JALYN reduces serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on JALYN may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for untreated men. (5.3) -Do not use JALYN with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Use caution in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) or strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors, or known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6. Concomitant use with known inhibitors can cause a marked increase in drug exposure. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant use of phosphodiesterase-5- (PDE-5) inhibitors, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) -Drugs that contain dutasteride, including JALYN, may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. (5.4, 6.1) -Prior to initiating treatment with JALYN, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. (5.5) -Women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle JALYN capsules due to potential risk to a male fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.7) -Patients should not donate blood until 6 months after their last dose of JALYN. (5.8) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery after alpha-adrenergic antagonist exposure. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they take or have taken JALYN capsules. (5.9) -Exercise caution with concomitant use of warfarin. (5.2, 7.2. 12.3) 5.1 Orthostatic Hypotension As with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) may occur in patients treated with tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, and can result in syncope. Patients starting treatment with JALYN should be cautioned to avoid situations where syncope could result in an injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Drug-drug Interactions Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) as this can significantly increase tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should be used with caution when coadministered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Caution is advised when tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Other Alpha-adrenergic Antagonists Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists because of the increased risk of symptomatic hypotension. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha-adrenergic-antagonist-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with PDE-5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these 2 drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Warfarin Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Effects on Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection Coadministration of dutasteride with tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as with dutasteride monotherapy. In clinical trials, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. Dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, a new baseline PSA should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on a dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with JALYN may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with JALYN, for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving JALYN, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.4 Increased Risk of High-grade Prostate Cancer In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR(R)), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume or trial-related factors impacted the results of these trials has not been established. 5.5 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases Prior to initiating treatment with JALYN, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist. 5.6 Exposure of Women—Risk to Male Fetus JALYN capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant. Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure. If a woman who is pregnant or could become pregnant comes in contact with a leaking capsule, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Priapism Priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity) has been associated (probably less than 1 in 50,000) with the use of alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of JALYN. Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients should be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.8 Blood Donation Men being treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient. 5.9 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of JALYN. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha-adrenergic antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patients had been off the alpha-adrenergic antagonist for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha-adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.10 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN. 5.11 Effect on Semen Characteristics Dutasteride The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 (n = 27 dutasteride, n = 23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all time-points remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride's effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known. Tamsulosin The effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythomycin), in combination with strong (e.g.,paroxetine) or moderate (e.g.,terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC., at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment. 2Coding preferred terms also include cold, common cold, head cold, flu, and flu-like symptoms. 3Coding preferred terms also include nasal congestion, stuffy nose, runny nose, sinus congestion, and hay fever. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (5.2, 7.1). Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [See Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There have been no drug interaction studies using JALYN. The following sections reflect information available for the individual components. 7.1 Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitors Dutasteride: Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions, use caution when prescribing a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin: Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6: Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in increases in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. A similar increase in exposure is expected in poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine: Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Warfarin Dutasteride: Concomitant administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks with warfarin does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the S- or R-warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin: A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Tamsulosin: Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Digoxin and Theophylline Dutasteride: Dutasteride does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin: Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Furosemide Tamsulosin: Tamsulosin had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the dose of tamsulosin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Calcium Channel Antagonists Dutasteride: Coadministration of verapamil or diltiazem decreases dutasteride clearance and leads to increased exposure to dutasteride. The change in dutasteride exposure is not considered to be clinically significant. No dosage adjustment of dutasteride is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Cholestyramine Dutasteride: Administration of a single 5-mg dose of dutasteride followed 1 hour later by a 12-g dose of cholestyramine does not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients, treated with coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin are ejaculation disorders, impotence, decreased libido, dizziness, and breast disorders.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving coadministration therapy (11%) compared with those receiving dutasteride (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy. Study withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin, and in 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to study withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%). In the CombAT study, over 4,800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride, or coadministration therapy (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) administered once daily in a 4-year double-blind study. Overall, 1,623 subjects received monotherapy with dutasteride; 1,611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610 subjects received coadministration therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88 years (mean age: 66 years) and 88% were Caucasian. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving coadminstration therapy and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving either dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy.

Cardiac Failure: In CombAT, after 4 years of treatment, the incidence of the composite term cardiac failure in the coadministration group (12/1,610; 0.7%) was higher than in either monotherapy group: dutasteride, 2/1,623 (0.1%) and tamsulosin, 9/1,611 (0.6%). Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating dutasteride in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking dutasteride was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both studies had co-morbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between dutasteride, alone or coadministered with tamsulosin, and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either study. Additional information regarding adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with dutasteride or tamsulosin monotherapy follows: Dutasteride: Long-Term Treatment (Up to 4 Years): High-grade Prostate Cancer: The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (N = 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of dutasteride (N = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were Caucasian. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [ see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with dutasteride. Reproductive and Breast Disorders: In the 3 pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with dutasteride, each 4 years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3 trials, there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Tamsulosin: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in two 13-week treatment trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride and at an incidence higher than in subjects receiving placebo were: infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough increased, sinusitis, and diarrhea. Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in clinical studies with tamsulosin monotherapy, a positive orthostatic test result was observed in 16% (81/502) of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride vs. 11% (54/493) of subjects receiving placebo. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in the tamsulosin-treated subjects than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precaution (5.1)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of JALYN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to drug exposure. Dutasteride: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, localized edema, serious skin reactions, and angioedema. Neoplasms: Male breast cancer. Tamsulosin: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory problems. Cardiac Disorders: Palpitations, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Skin Disorders: Skin desquamation, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Constipation, vomiting. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Priapism. Vascular Disorders: Hypotension. Ophthalmologic Disorders: During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) associated with alpha adrenergic antagonist therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope can occur. Advise patients of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result if syncope occurs. (5.1) Do not use JALYN with other alpha adrenergic antagonists, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) JALYN reduces serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on JALYN may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for untreated men. (5.3) Do not use JALYN with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Use caution in combination with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) or strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors, or known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6. Concomitant use with known inhibitors can cause a marked increase in drug exposure. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) Exercise caution with concomitant use of PDE-5 inhibitors, as this may increase the risk of hypotension. (5.2) Drugs that contain dutasteride, including JALYN, may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. (5.4, 6.1) Prior to initiating treatment with JALYN, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle JALYN Capsules due to potential risk to a male fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism. (5.7) Patients should not donate blood until 6 months after their last dose of JALYN. (5.8) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery after alpha adrenergic antagonist exposure. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they take or have taken JALYN Capsules. (5.9) Exercise caution with concomitant use of warfarin. (5.2, 7.4. 12.3) 5.1 Orthostatic Hypotension As with other alpha adrenergic antagonists, orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) may occur in patients treated with tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, and can result in syncope. Patients starting treatment with JALYN should be cautioned to avoid situations where syncope could result in an injury [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Drug-Drug Interactions Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) as this can significantly increase tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should be used with caution when coadministered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine: Caution is advised when tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with cimetidine [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Other Alpha Adrenergic Antagonists: Tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN, should not be coadministered with other alpha adrenergic antagonists because of the increased risk of symptomatic hypotension. Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE-5 Inhibitors): Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic antagonist-containing products, including JALYN, are coadministered with PDE-5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these 2 drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Warfarin: Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN [see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection Coadministration of dutasteride with tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as with dutasteride monotherapy. In clinical studies, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. Dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, a new baseline PSA should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on a dutasteride-containing treatment, including JALYN, may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with JALYN may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with JALYN, for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving JALYN, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.4 Increased Risk of High-grade Prostate Cancer In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [ see Indications and Usage (1.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.5 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases Prior to initiating treatment with JALYN, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist. 5.6 Exposure of Women—Risk to Male Fetus JALYN Capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant. Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure. If a woman who is pregnant or could become pregnant comes in contact with a leaking capsule, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Priapism Priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity) has been associated (probably less than 1 in 50,000) with the use of alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of JALYN. Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients should be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.8 Blood Donation Men being treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including JALYN, should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient. 5.9 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients treated with alpha adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of JALYN. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha adrenergic antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery (2 days to 9 months). Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they take or have taken JALYN Capsules. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modification to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. The benefit of stopping alpha adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. 5.10 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including JALYN. 5.11 Effect on Semen Characteristics Dutasteride: The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 (n = 27 dutasteride, n = 23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all time-points remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride's effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known. Tamsulosin: The effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3). 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 ) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men.

Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis In the two U.S. studies, symptomatic postural hypotension was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by no patients in the placebo group. Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 )]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin ( 5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1 )]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.2 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.3 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.4 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, or in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg). (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) - Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with tamsulosin can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibition Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin hydrochloride have not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cimetidine Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking Agents The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been determined; however, interactions between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 PDE5 Inhibitors Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril Dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Digoxin and Theophylline Dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Furosemide Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS -The most common adverse events (>=2% of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo) with the 0.4 mg dose or 0.8 mg dose were headache, dizziness, rhinitis, infection, abnormal ejaculation, asthenia, back pain, diarrhea, pharyngitis, chest pain, cough increased, somnolence, nausea, sinusitis, insomnia, libido decreased, tooth disorder, and blurred vision (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CARACO Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. at 1-800-818-4555, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 1 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 1 Treatment-EmergentA treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria:-The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication and subsequently increased in severity during double-blind treatment; or-The adverse event was present prior to or at the time of initial dosing with double-blind study medication, disappeared completely, and then reappeared during double-blind treatment.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constipation, and vomiting have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur (5.1) -Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. (5.2, 7.1, 12.3) -Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents (5.2, 7.2, 12.3) -Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin (5.2, 7.4, 12.3) -Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism (5.3) -Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. (5.5) -Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards (5.4) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1 blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril In three studies in hypertensive subjects (age range 47-79 years) whose blood pressure was controlled with stable doses of Procardia XL(R), atenolol, or enalapril for at least three months, FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg for seven days followed by FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg for another seven days (n=8 per study) resulted in no clinically significant effects on blood pressure and pulse rate compared to placebo (n=4 per study). Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are administered concomitantly with Procardia XL(R), atenolol, or enalapril. Warfarin A definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited in vitro and in vivo studies are inconclusive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and FLOMAX capsules. Digoxin and Theophylline In two studies in healthy volunteers (n=10 per study; age range 19-39 years) receiving FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg/day for two days, followed by FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg/day for five to eight days, single intravenous doses of digoxin 0.5 mg or theophylline 5 mg/kg resulted in no change in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline. Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline. Furosemide The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between Flomax(R) (tamsulosin hydrochloride) capsules 0.8 mg/day (steady-state) and furosemide 20 mg intravenously (single dose) was evaluated in ten healthy volunteers (age range 21-40 years). FLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage. Cytochrome P450 Inhibition: Cimetidine The effects of cimetidine at the highest recommended dose (400 mg every six hours for six days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in ten healthy volunteers (age range 21-38 years). Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%). Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg. Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 The effects of ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) at 400 mg every day on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers (age range from 23 to 47 years). Treatment with ketoconazole resulted in a Cmax and AUC that increased by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. Therefore, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should be used with caution in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Doses above 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole). The effects of paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) at 20 mg every day on the pharmacokinetics of a single FLOMAX capsule 0.4 mg dose was investigated in 23 healthy volunteers (age range from 23 to 48 years). Treatment with paroxetine resulted in a Cmax and AUC that increased by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. Therefore, FLOMAX capsules should be used with caution in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg FLOMAX capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with FLOMAX capsules and 798 patients administered placebo. Table 3 summarizes the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in >=2% of patients receiving either FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg, or 0.8 mg and at an incidence numerically higher than that in the placebo group during two 13-week U.S. trials (US92-03A and US93-01) conducted in 1487 men. Table 3 Treatment-Emergent1 Adverse Events Occurring in >=2% of Flomax(R) (tamsulosin hydrochloride) Capsules or Placebo Patients in Two U.S. Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies BODY SYSTEM/ ADVERSE EVENT FLOMAX CAPSULES GROUPS PLACEBO 0.4 mg n=502 0.8 mg n=492 n=493 A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event satisfying one of the following criteria: The adverse event occurred for the first time after initial dosing with double-blind study medication.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >=20 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure >=10 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of >=20 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate >=100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post-dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received Flomax(R) (tamsulosin hydrochloride) capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post-dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.4 mg once daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the FLOMAX capsules 0.8 mg once daily group and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in FLOMAX capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope (see WARNINGS ). Abnormal Ejaculation: Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 3, abnormal ejaculation was associated with FLOMAX capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of FLOMAX capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group, and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FLOMAX capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to FLOMAX capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of palpitations, hypotension, skin desquamation, constipation and vomiting have been received during the post-marketing period. During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha-1 blocker therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, General )."
