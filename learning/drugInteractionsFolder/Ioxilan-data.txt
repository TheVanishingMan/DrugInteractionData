        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Renal toxicity has been reported in a few patients with liver dysfunction who were given an oral cholecystographic agent followed by intravascular contrast agents. Administration of any intravascular contrast agent should therefore be postponed in any patient with a known or suspected hepatic or biliary disorder who has recently received a cholecystographic contrast agent. Other drugs should not be admixed with OXILAN(R) (Ioxilan Injection)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS For demographics, see CLINICAL TRIALS section. The following table of incidence of reactions is based upon controlled clinical studies in which OXILAN(R) was compared with a nonionic contrast agent (iohexol) in 531 patients. It includes all reported adverse events, regardless of attribution. Adverse reactions are listed by body system and in decreasing order of occurrence greater than 0.5% in the OXILAN(R) group. Body System Adverse Event Ioxilan (n = 531) Comparator (n = 542) Body as a Whole Headache 19 (3.6%) 15 (2.8%) Fever 9 (1.7%) 11 (2.0%) Hematoma at Injection Site 4 (0.8%) 0 (0%) Chills 3 (0.6%) 0 (0%) Cardiovascular Angina Pectoris 7 (1.3%) 11 (2.0%) Hypertension 6 (1.1%) 3 (0.6%) Bradycardia 4 (0.8%) 0 (0%) Hypotension 5 (0.9%) 3 (0.6%) Digestive Nausea 8 (1.5%) 7 (1.3%) Diarrhea 5 (0.9%) 4 (0.7%) Nausea with Vomiting 5 (0.9%) 5 (0.9%) Vomiting 3 (0.6%) 4 (0.7%) Nervous Dizziness 4 (0.8%) 1 (0.2%) Skin Urticaria 4 (0.8%) 4 (0.7%) Rash 3 (0.6%) 4 (0.7%) One or more adverse reactions were reported in 76 of 531 (14.3%) of patients in the clinical trials, coincidental with the administration of OXILAN(R) or within the study follow-up period of 24 to 72 hours. The incidence and type of adverse reactions were similar to those associated with the nonionic comparator (iohexol) used in the clinical trials. OXILAN(R), as do other iodinated contrast agents, often causes warmth and/or pain on injection. The rates are similar to that of the iohexol comparator. Serious, life threatening and fatal reactions have been associated with the administration of iodine-containing contrast media. In all clinical trials 3/835 (0.3%) patients given OXILAN(R) and 3/542 (0.6%) given iohexol died 4 days or later after drug administration. In the controlled trials 8/531 (1.5%) patients given OXILAN(R) and 6/542 (1.1%) given iohexol had serious adverse events. The following adverse reactions were observed <= 0.5% of patients receiving OXILAN(R) Injection: BODY: allergic reaction, asthenia, chest and back pain, edema of the neck, facial edema, pain, peripheral edema; CARDIOVASCULAR: atrial fibrillation, syncope, tachycardia, vasodilation, ventricular extrasystole; DIGESTIVE: anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, dysphagia, GI hemorrhage, ileus, liver failure; NERVOUS: hypotonia, nystagmus, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo; RESPIRATORY: dyspnea, pharyngitis, rhinitis; SKIN: pruritus, sweating; SPECIAL SENSES: amblyopia, conjunctivitis, taste perversion, vision abnormality; UROGENITAL: anuria, dysuria, hematuria, infection of urinary tract, impairment of urination, kidney failure. Additional adverse events reported in postmarketing surveillance with the use of OXILAN(R) Injection include: bronchospasm."
