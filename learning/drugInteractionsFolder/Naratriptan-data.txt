        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and naratriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of treatment with naratriptan is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive. 7.3 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: -Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] -Arrhythmias [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] -Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] -Cerebrovascular events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] -Other vasospasm reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] -Medication overuse headache [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)] -Serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)] -Increase in blood pressure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)] -Hypersensitivity reactions [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)] Most common adverse reactions (>=2 % and > placebo) were paresthesias, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-888-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term open-label trial where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 15 patients (3.6%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were paresthesias, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms, which occurred at a rate of 2% and at least 2 times placebo rate. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials of approximately 1,752 exposures to placebo and naratriptan in adult patients with migraine. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with naratriptan 2.5 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group in the 5 pooled trials are included in Table 1. Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) -Arrhythmias: Discontinue naratriptan if occurs. (5.2) -Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk. (5.3) -Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue naratriptan if occurs. (5.4) -Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue naratriptan if occurs. (5.5) -Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) -Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue naratriptan if occurs. (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Naratriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of naratriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Naratriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving naratriptan. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, naratriptan is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of naratriptan in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of naratriptan. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of naratriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue naratriptan if these disturbances occur. Naratriptan contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with naratriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists, including naratriptan, are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue naratriptan if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Naratriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Naratriptan may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses of naratriptan. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with naratriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue naratriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with naratriptan. Naratriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, in patients receiving naratriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Naratriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to naratriptan."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: -Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] -Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] -Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] -Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] -Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Most common adverse reactions (>=2% and >placebo) were paresthesias, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term open-label trial where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 15 patients (3.6%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were paresthesias, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms, which occurred at a rate of 2% and at least 2 times placebo rate. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials of approximately 1,752 exposures to placebo and Naratriptan Tablets, USP in adult patients with migraine. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with Naratriptan Tablets, USP 2.5 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group in the 5 pooled trials are included in Table 1. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by age or weight of the patients, duration of headache prior to treatment, presence of aura, use of prophylactic medications, or tobacco use. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Table 1"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) -Arrhythmias: Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if occurs. (5.2) -Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk. (5.3) -Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if occurs. (5.4) -Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if occurs. (5.5) -Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) -Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets USP, if occurs. (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Naratriptan Tablets, USP. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Naratriptan Tablets, USP may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Naratriptan Tablets, USP. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Naratriptan Tablets, USP in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of Naratriptan Tablets, USP. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Naratriptan Tablets, USP. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if these disturbances occur. Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with Naratriptan Tablets, USP and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists, including Naratriptan Tablets, USP, are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Naratriptan Tablets, USP may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses of Naratriptan Tablets, USP. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with Naratriptan Tablets, USP, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Naratriptan Tablets, USP if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with Naratriptan Tablets, USP. Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, in patients receiving Naratriptan Tablets, USP. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Naratriptan Tablets, USP is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Naratriptan Tablets, USP."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Most common adverse reactions (>=2 % and > placebo) were paresthesias, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Prosar at 866-562-4590 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term open-label trial where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 15 patients (3.6%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were paresthesias, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise/fatigue, and throat/neck symptoms, which occurred at a rate of 2% and at least 2 times placebo rate. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials of approximately 1,752 exposures to placebo and naratriptan tablets in adult patients with migraine. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with naratriptan tablets 2.5 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group in the 5 pooled trials are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2% of Patients Treated With Naratriptan Tablets and at a Frequency Greater Than Placebo Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients Reporting Naratriptan Tablets 1 mg (n = 627) Naratriptan Tablets 2.5 mg (n = 627) Placebo (n = 498) Atypical sensation 2 4 1 Paresthesias (all types) 1 2 <1 Gastrointestinal 6 7 5 Nausea 4 5 4 Neurological 4 7 3 Dizziness 1 2 1 Drowsiness 1 2 <1 Malaise/fatigue 2 2 1 Pain and pressure sensation 2 4 2 Throat/neck symptoms 1 2 1 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by age or weight of the patients, duration of headache prior to treatment, presence of aura, use of prophylactic medications, or tobacco use. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue naratriptan tablets if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue naratriptan tablets if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue naratriptan tablets if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue naratriptan tablets if occurs. (5.7) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Naratriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of naratriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Naratriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving naratriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, naratriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of naratriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of naratriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of naratriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue naratriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Naratriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with naratriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists, including naratriptan tablets, are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue naratriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Naratriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Naratriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses of naratriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with naratriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue naratriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with naratriptan tablets. Naratriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, in patients receiving naratriptan tablets. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Naratriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to naratriptan tablets."
