"ADVERSE REACTIONS Precise frequency data from controlled clinical studies with CANTIL are not available. Gastrointestinal System: vomiting, nausea, constipation, loss of taste, bloated feeling, dry mouth Central Nervous System: mental confusion, dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, headache, nervousness Ophthalmologic: increased ocular tension, cycloplegia, blurred vision, dilation of the pupil Dermatologic-Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, urticaria Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations Genitourinary: urinary retention, urinary hesitancy Miscellaneous: decreased sweating, drowsiness, insomnia, impotence, suppression of lactation"$$
"Drug Interactions The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs: amantadine, antiarrhythmic agents of class I (e.g., quinidine), antihistamines, antipsychotic agents (e.g., phenothiazines), benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors, narcotic analgesics (e.g., meperidine), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity. Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.) Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result. Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as metoclopramide. Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided. The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion."$$
