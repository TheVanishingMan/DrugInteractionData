        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Palonosetron is eliminated from the body through both renal excretion and metabolic pathways with the latter mediated via multiple CYP enzymes. Further in vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and, CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Coadministration of 0.25 mg I.V. palonosetron and 20 mg I.V. dexamethasone in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. In an interaction study in healthy subjects where palonosetron 0.25 mg (I.V. bolus) was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, Cmax: 15% increase). A study in healthy volunteers involving single-dose I.V. palonosetron (0.75 mg) and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. In controlled clinical trials, ALOXI injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents. Palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumor activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C) in murine tumor models. The potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults (incidence >=5%) are headache and constipation (6.1). The most common adverse reactions in postoperative nausea and vomiting (incidence >= 2%) are QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation (6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EISAI at 1-888-422-4743 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 1374 adult patients received palonosetron. Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity with ALOXI and ondansetron or dolasetron. Following is a listing of all adverse reactions reported by >= 2% of patients in these trials (Table 1). Table 1: Adverse Reactions from Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Studies >= 2% in any Treatment Group Event ALOXI 0.25 mg (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg I.V. (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg I.V. (N=194) Headache 60 (9%) 34 (8%) 32 (16%) Constipation 29 (5%) 8 (2%) 12 (6%) Diarrhea 8 (1%) 7 (2%) 4 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 9 (2%) 4 (2%) Fatigue 3 (< 1%) 4 (1%) 4 (2%) Abdominal Pain 1 (< 1%) 2 (< 1%) 3 (2%) Insomnia 1 (< 1%) 3 (1%) 3 (2%) In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron dose of approximately 0.75 mg, three times the recommended dose. One patient received a 10 mcg/kg oral dose in a post-operative nausea and vomiting study and one healthy subject received a 0.75 mg I.V. dose in a pharmacokinetic study. In clinical trials, the following infrequently reported adverse reactions, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following administration of ALOXI to adult patients receiving concomitant cancer chemotherapy: Cardiovascular: 1%: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, < 1%: hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. In many cases, the relationship to ALOXI was unclear. Dermatological: < 1%: allergic dermatitis, rash. Hearing and Vision: < 1%: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia. Gastrointestinal System: 1%: diarrhea, < 1%: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence. General: 1%: weakness, < 1%: fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome. Liver: < 1%: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Metabolic: 1%: hyperkalemia, < 1%: electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia. Musculoskeletal: < 1%: arthralgia. Nervous System: 1%: dizziness, < 1%: somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia. Psychiatric: 1%: anxiety, < 1%: euphoric mood. Urinary System: < 1%: urinary retention. Vascular: < 1%: vein discoloration, vein distention. Pediatrics In a pediatric clinical trial for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 163 cancer patients received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients had a mean age of 8.4 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 46% male; and 93% white. The following adverse reactions were reported for palonosetron: Nervous System: <1%: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: <1%: infusion site pain. Dermatological: <1%: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. In the trial, adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. 6.2 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions cited in Table 2 were reported in >= 2% of adults receiving I.V. ALOXI 0.075 mg immediately before induction of anesthesia in one phase 2 and two phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials. Rates of events between palonosetron and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. Please refer to Section 12.2, thorough QT/QTc study results, for data demonstrating the lack of palonosetron effect on QT/QTc. Table 2: Adverse Reactions from Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies >= 2% in any Treatment Group Event ALOXI 0.075 mg (N=336) Placebo (N=369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 16 (5%) 11 (3%) Bradycardia 13 (4%) 16 (4%) Headache 11 (3%) 14 (4%) Constipation 8 (2%) 11(3%) In these clinical trials, the following infrequently reported adverse reactions, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following administration of ALOXI to adult patients receiving concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications including those associated with anesthesia: Cardiovascular: 1%: electrocardiogram QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, < 1%: blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. Dermatological: 1%: pruritus. Gastrointestinal System: 1%: flatulence, < 1%: dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia. General: < 1%: chills. Liver: 1%: increases in AST and/or ALT, < 1%: hepatic enzyme increased. Metabolic: < 1%: hypokalemia, anorexia. Nervous System: < 1%: dizziness. Respiratory: < 1%: hypoventilation, laryngospasm. Urinary System: 1%: urinary retention. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ALOXI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Very rare cases (<1/10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock and injection site reactions (burning, induration, discomfort and pain) were reported from postmarketing experience of ALOXI 0.25 mg in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5.1) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (5.2) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ALOXI and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ALOXI and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ALOXI is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Substrates: inhibition of CYP3A4 by netupitant can result in increased plasma concentrations of the concomitant drug that can last at least 4 days and may last longer after single dosage administration of AKYNZEO; use with caution (7.1) CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin): decreased plasma concentrations of netupitant; avoid use (7.2) 7.1 Effects of AKYNZEO on Other Drugs Interaction with CYP3A4 Substrates Netupitant, a component of AKYNZEO, is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. AKYNZEO should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant medications that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. The plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates can increase when co-administered with AKYNZEO. The inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 can last for multiple days. Dexamethasone A two-fold increase in the systemic exposure of dexamethasone was observed 4 days after single dose of netupitant. The duration of the effect was not studied beyond 4 days. Administer a reduced dose of dexamethasone with AKYNZEO [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Midazolam When administered with netupitant, the systemic exposure to midazolam was significantly increased. Consider the potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) when administering these drugs with AKYNZEO. Interaction with chemotherapeutic agents The systemic exposure of chemotherapy agents metabolized by CYP3A4 can increase when administered with AKYNZEO. Chemotherapy agents that are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4 include docetaxel, paclitaxel, etoposide, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, imatinib, vinorelbine, vinblastine, and vincristine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution and monitoring for chemotherapeutic related adverse reactions are advised in patients receiving chemotherapy agents metabolized primarily by CYP3A4. Interaction with oral contraceptives Clinically significant effect of AKYNZEO on the efficacy of oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is unlikely. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on AKYNZEO Netupitant, a component of AKYNZEO, is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of AKYNZEO in patients who are chronically using a strong CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin. A strong CYP3A inducer can decrease the efficacy of AKYNZEO by substantially reducing plasma concentrations of the netupitant component [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of AKYNZEO with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole) can significantly increase the systemic exposure to the netupitant component of AKYNZEO. However, no dosage adjustment is necessary for single dose administration of AKYNZEO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=3% and greater than palonosetron) are headache, asthenia, dyspepsia, fatigue, constipation and erythema (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EISAI at 1-888-422-4743 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety of AKYNZEO was evaluated in 1538 cancer patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials. The data described below reflect exposure to AKYNZEO in 1169 cancer patients, receiving at least one cycle of cancer chemotherapy in 3 active-controlled trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ], including 782 exposed to AKYNZEO for at least 4 cycles and 321 exposed for at least 6 cycles, up to a maximum of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. The median age was 55, 79% were female, 83% were White, 13% were Asian, and 4% were Hispanic. All patients received a single oral dose of AKYNZEO 1 hour prior to the start of each chemotherapy cycle. In all studies, dexamethasone was co-administered with AKYNZEO [see Clinical Studies (14), Table 5 and Table 7]. Cisplatin Based Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy In a single-cycle study of patients receiving cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 136 patients were treated with AKYNZEO. Table 1 shows adverse reactions defined as adverse events reported at an incidence of at least 3% and for which the AKYNZEO rate exceeded palonosetron alone. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=3% of Cancer Patients Receiving AKYNZEO and Cisplatin Based Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (Cycle 1) Adverse Reactions AKYNZEO netupitant 300 mg/ palonosetron 0.5 mg (N=136) Palonosetron 0.5 mg (N=136) Dyspepsia 4% 2% Fatigue 4% 2% Constipation 3% 1 Erythema 3% 2% Anthracyclines and Cyclophosphamide Based Chemotherapy In a study of patients receiving anthracycline and cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy, 725 patients were treated with AKYNZEO during Cycle 1, and 635 of these patients continued for up to 8 cycles in a multiple-cycle extension. Table 2 shows adverse reactions defined as adverse events reported at an incidence of at least 3% and for which the AKYNZEO rate exceeded palonosetron alone during Cycle 1. The adverse reaction profile in subsequent cycles was similar to that observed in Cycle 1. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=3% of Cancer Patients Receiving AKYNZEO and Anthracyclines and Cyclophosphamide Based Chemotherapy (Cycle 1) Adverse Reactions AKYNZEO netupitant 300 mg/ palonosetron 0.5 mg (N=725) Palonosetron 0.5 mg (N=725) Headache 9% 7% Asthenia 8% 7% Fatigue 7% 5% In addition to the adverse reactions shown above, there were reports of concomitant elevations of transaminases > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin in both arms of the two trials that compared AKYNZEO to oral palonosetron, and the frequency of these elevations was comparable between treatment groups. See Table 3. Table 3: Liver Function Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory Changes AKYNZEO netupitant 300 mg/ palonosetron 0.5 mg N=861 Palonosetron 0.5 mg N=861 AST > 3 x ULN and/or ALT > 3 x ULN with Total Bilirubin > ULN 3 (0.3%) 5 (0.6%) AST > 10 x ULN and/or ALT > 10 x ULN with Total Bilirubin > ULN - 2 (0.2%) AST > 3 x ULN and/or ALT > 3 x ULN with Total Bilirubin >= 2 x ULN 1 (0.1%) 1 (0.1%) In a multi-cycle safety study of 412 patients, the safety profile of AKYNZEO (n = 308) was comparable to aprepitant and palonosetron (n = 104) in patients undergoing initial and repeat cycles (median 5 cycles, range of 1-14 cycles) of chemotherapy, including carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin regimens. There were no reports of concomitant elevations of transaminases > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin in this study in either arm. In a randomized, clinical non-inferiority study, that compared oral palonosetron 0.5 mg to intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg in cancer patients scheduled to receive highly emetogenic cisplatin (>70 mg/m2) based chemotherapy, there were two patients (0.5%; 2/369) in the intravenous palonosetron arm who had concomitant elevations of transaminases and total bilirubin. Neither experienced transaminase elevations of > 10 x ULN."
