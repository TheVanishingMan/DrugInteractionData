        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with other drugs known to be associated with neutropenia or agranulocytosis; however, if this is not possible, closely monitor the absolute neutrophil count. (7.1) Avoid concomitant use of UGT1A6 inhibitors with FERRIPROX. (7.2) Allow at least a 4-hour interval between FERRIPROX and mineral supplements, and antacids that contain polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, and zinc). (7.3) 7.1 Drugs Associated with Neutropenia or Agranulocytosis Avoid concomitant use of FERRIPROX with other drugs known to be associated with neutropenia or agranulocytosis; however, if this is not possible, monitor the absolute neutrophil count more frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) A clinical study to evaluate the effect of coadministration of UGT1A6 inhibitors with FERRIPROX on the systemic exposure of deferiprone has not been conducted. However, in the presence of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 inhibitor, phenylbutazone, the in vitro glucuronidation of deferiprone is reduced by 78%. Therefore, avoid concomitant use of UGT1A6 inhibitors, (e.g. diclofenac, probenecid, or silymarin (milk thistle)) with FERRIPROX [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Polyvalent Cations Concurrent use of FERRIPROX with foods, mineral supplements, and antacids that contain polyvalent cations has not been studied. However, since deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, and zinc), allow at least a 4-hour interval between FERRIPROX and other medications (e.g., antacids), or supplements containing these polyvalent cations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are (incidence >= 5%) chromaturia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, arthralgia and neutropenia. (5.1, 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ApoPharma Inc. at: Telephone: 1-866-949-0995 Email: medicalsafety@apopharma.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Agranulocytosis/Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver Enzyme Elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Zinc Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for FERRIPROX represents the pooled data collected from 642 patients who participated in single arm or active-controlled clinical trials. The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with FERRIPROX was agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials were chromaturia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, arthralgia and neutropenia. The table below lists the adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with FERRIPROX in clinical trials.

Chromaturia (reddish/brown discoloration of the urine) is a result of the excretion of the iron in the urine. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving FERRIPROX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: thrombocytosis, pancytopenia. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure. Congenital, familial and genetic disorders: hypospadias. Eye disorders: diplopia, papilledema, retinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal disorders: enterocolitis, rectal hemorrhage, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis, parotid gland enlargement. General disorders and administration site conditions: chills, pyrexia, edema peripheral, multi-organ failure. Hepatobiliary disorders: jaundice, hepatomegaly. Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity. Infections and infestations: cryptococcal cutaneous infection, enteroviral encephalitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, sepsis, furuncle, infectious hepatitis, rash pustular, subcutaneous abscess. Investigations: blood bilirubin increased, blood creatinine phosphokinase increased. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: metabolic acidosis, dehydration. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myositis, chondropathy, trismus. Nervous system disorders: cerebellar syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion, gait disturbance, intracranial pressure increased, psychomotor skills impaired, pyramidal tract syndrome, somnolence. Psychiatric disorders: bruxism, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder. Renal disorders: glycosuria, hemoglobinuria.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS If infection occurs while on FERRIPROX, interrupt therapy and monitor the ANC more frequently. (5.1) FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the ptoential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while on this drug. (5.2) 5.1 Agranulocytosis/Neutropenia Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with FERRIPROX use. FERRIPROX can also cause neutropenia, which may foreshadow agranulocytosis. Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting FERRIPROX therapy and monitor the ANC weekly on therapy. Interrupt FERRIPROX therapy if neutropenia develops (ANC < 1.5 x 109/L). Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops, and monitor the ANC frequently. Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection. In pooled clinical trials, the incidence of agranulocytosis was 1.7% of patients. The mechanism of FERRIPROX-associated agranulocytosis is unknown. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of FERRIPROX, but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death. Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis/neutropenia prior to initiating FERRIPROX treatment. For neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 109/L and > 0.5 x 109/L): Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue FERRIPROX and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia. Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count daily until recovery (ANC >= 1.5 x 109/L). For agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L): Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate. Do not resume FERRIPROX in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Do not rechallenge patients who develop neutropenia with FERRIPROX unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. 5.2 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on evidence of genotoxicity and developmental toxicity in animal studies, FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses. If FERRIPROX is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking FERRIPROX, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy when taking FERRIPROX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.3 Liver Enzyme Elevations IIn clinical studies, 7.5% of 642 subjects treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values. Four (0.62%) FERRIPROX-treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.16%) due to an increase in both ALT and AST. Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with FERRIPROX, and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels. 5.4 Zinc Deficiency Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on FERRIPROX therapy. Monitor plasma zinc, and supplement in the event of a deficiency.",

In vitro studies suggest that UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 is primarily responsible for the glucuronidation of deferiprone which can be reduced up to 78% in the presence of the UGT1A6 inhibitor phenylbutazone. However, the clinical significance of coadministration of Ferriprox with a UGT1A6 inhibitor (e.g. diclofenac, probenecid, or silymarin (milk thistle)) on the systemic exposure of deferiprone has not been determined. Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions that may require downward dose titration or interruption when Ferriprox is concomitantly administered with a UGT1A6 inhibitor. 7.3 Polyvalent Cations Concurrent use of Ferriprox with foods, mineral supplements, and antacids that contain polyvalent cations has not been studied. However, since deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, and zinc), allow at least a 4-hour interval between Ferriprox and other medications (e.g., antacids), or supplements containing these polyvalent cations [see Dosage and Administration (2)].",
