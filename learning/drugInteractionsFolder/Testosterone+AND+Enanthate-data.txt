        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 3%) is skin reactions at the application site (16.1%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ENDO at 1-800-462-3636 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In a controlled multicenter, open label, non-comparative 90-day clinical study, 149 hypogonadal patients were treated with FORTESTA [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Adverse reactions occurred in 22.8% (34/149) of patients. The most common adverse reaction reported in this study was skin reactions associated with the site of application (16.1%; 24/149) of which 79% (19/24) were mild, and the remainder were moderate (21%; 5/24) (Table 3). Table 3 - Adverse Reactions Reported in >1% Patients in the US Phase 3 Clinical Trial of FORTESTA Adverse Reaction Number (%) of Patients N = 149 Skin reaction 24 (16.1%) Prostatic specific antigen increased 2 (1.3%) Abnormal dreams 2 (1.3%) During the 90 day trial 5 patients (3.4%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These reactions were: 1 patient with contact dermatitis (considered probably related to FORTESTA application), 1 with application site reaction (considered probably related to FORTESTA application), 1 with gastrointestinal hypomotility (considered possibly related to FORTESTA application), 1 with severe dyspnea (considered not related to FORTESTA application), and 1 with moderate contusion (considered not related to FORTESTA application). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of FORTESTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4). Table 4 - Adverse Drug Reactions from Post approval Experience of FORTESTA by System Organ Class System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders Polycythemia Eye disorders Vitreous detachment Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal symptoms General disorders and administrative site conditions Application site erythema, irritation, pruritus, and swelling; fatigue, influenza like illness, and malaise. Investigations Decreased serum testosterone, increased hematocrit and hemoglobin Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Pain in extremity Nervous system disorders Dizziness, headache, and migraine Reproductive system and breast disorders Erectile dysfunction, and priapism Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Allergic dermatitis, erythema, rash, and papular rash. Vascular disorders Venous thromboembolism Cardiovascular disorders Myocardial infarction, stroke Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to FORTESTA. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. FORTESTA should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) FORTESTA is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patients for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using FORTESTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been Postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as FORTESTA. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with FORTESTA and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use FORTESTA. 5.6 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, FORTESTA is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including FORTESTA, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. FORTESTA is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including FORTESTA, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including FORTESTA, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including FORTESTA, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding globulin Androgens, including FORTESTA, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol based products, including FORTESTA, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid smoking, fire or flame until the FORTESTA gel has dried."

In this clinical trial of Testim(R), six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: vertigo, coronary artery disease, depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection/pneumonia (none of which were considered related to Testim(R) administration), mood swings and hypertension. No Testim(R) patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 gm/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively. In the combined ongoing U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim(R) for at least 6 months. The preliminary results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCETestim(R) contains testosterone, a Schedule III controlled substance as defined by the Anabolic Steroids Control Act. Oral ingestion of Testim(R) will not result in clinically significant serum testosterone concentrations due to extensive first-pass metabolism."

Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%) are acne, application site reaction, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders. (6.1) 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Other less common adverse reactions, reported in fewer than 1% of patients included: amnesia, anxiety, discolored hair, dizziness, dry skin, hirsutism, hostility, impaired urination, paresthesia, penis disorder, peripheral edema, sweating, and vasodilation. In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with Testosterone Gel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of Testosterone Gel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to Testosterone Gel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No Testosterone Gel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with Testosterone Gel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with Testosterone Gel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3.

There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on Testosterone Gel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post- baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Testosterone Gel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4).

Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo) are application site reactions and increased hematocrit. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact UPSHER-SMITH LABORATORIES, INC. at 1-855-899-9180 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Subjects could be counted in both testosterone gel treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels. Adverse reactions reported by >=1% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Incidence of Adverse Reactions (Reported by >=1% of the Testosterone Gel Patients and Greater than Placebo) in the Controlled Clinical Trial Through 90 Days Testosterone Gel 50 mg Testosterone Gel 100 mg Placebo Event (n=103) (n=149) (n=99) Application Site Reactions 2% 4% 3% Blood Pressure Increased 1% 1% 0% Gynecomastia 1% 0% 0% Headache 1% 1% 0% Hematocrit/Hemoglobin Increased 1% 2% 0% Hot Flushes 1% 0% 0% Insomnia 1% 0% 0% Mood Swings 1% 0% 0% Smell Disorder 1% 0% 0% Spontaneous Penile Erection 1% 0% 0% Taste Disorder 1% 1% 0% The following adverse reactions occurred in fewer than 1% of patients but were greater in testosterone gel groups compared to the placebo group: activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, blood creatinine increased, prothrombin time prolonged, appetite increased, sensitive nipples, and acne. In this clinical trial of testosterone gel, six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No testosterone gel patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received testosterone gel for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Cardiovascular Disorders: Myocardial infarction, stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Vascular Disorders: Venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to Vogelxo. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Vogelxo should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.12) Vogelxo is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Men with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using Vogelxo [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as Vogelxo. Evaluate patients who report signs and symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Vogelxo and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Vogelxo. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, Vogelxo is not indicated for use in women. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Vogelxo, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevate blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Vogelxo is not known to produce these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Vogelxo while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including Vogelxo, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after any dose increases. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Vogelxo, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Vogelxo, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including Vogelxo, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the Vogelxo has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 5%) is an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Abbott Laboratories at 1-800-241-1643 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA >4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving AndroGel 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value >4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing. During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by >2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the AndroGel 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the AndroGel 1.62% treated group versus placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients in the 182-Day, Double-Blind Period of AndroGel 1.62% Clinical Trial * PSA increased includes: PSA values that met pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values (an average change from baseline > 0.75 ng/mL and/or an average PSA value >4.0 ng/mL based on two measurements) as well as those reported as adverse events. ** Emotional lability includes: mood swings, affective disorder, impatience, anger, and aggression. *** Contact dermatitis includes: 4 patients with dermatitis at non-application sites.

In the open-label period of the study (N=191), the most commonly reported adverse reaction (experienced by greater than 2% of patients) was increased PSA (n=13; 6.2%) and sinusitis. Other adverse reactions reported by less than or equal to 2% of patients included increased hemoglobin or hematocrit, hypertension, acne, libido decreased, insomnia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, 25 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (10.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 17 patients with PSA increased and 1 report each of: hematocrit increased, blood pressure increased, frequent urination, diarrhea, fatigue, pituitary tumor, dizziness, skin erythema and skin nodule (same patient - neither at application site), vasovagal syncope, and diabetes mellitus. During the 182-day, open-label period, 9 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 6 reports of PSA increased, 2 of hematocrit increased, and 1 each of triglycerides increased and prostate cancer. Application Site Reactions In the 182-day double-blind period of the study, application site reactions were reported in two (2/234; 0.9%) patients receiving AndroGel 1.62%, both of which resolved. Neither of these patients discontinued the study due to application site adverse reactions. In the open-label period of the study, application site reactions were reported in three (3/219; 1.4%) additional patients that were treated with AndroGel 1.62%. None of these subjects were discontinued from the study due to application site reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 5). Table 5: Adverse Reactions from Post Approval Experience of AndroGel 1% by System Organ Class * Impaired urination includes nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream ** Lab test abnormal includes elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, or elevated serum creatinine *** Testis disorder includes atrophy or non-palpable testis, varicocele, testis sensitivity or tenderness System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, polycythemia, anemia Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination* Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests Investigations: Lab test abnormal**, elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium [includes hypokalemia], phosphorus, sodium), impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, HDL, fluctuating testosterone levels, weight increase Neoplasms: Prostate cancer Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, insomnia, sleep apnea Psychiatric disorders: Amnesia, anxiety, depression, hostility, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections), prostate enlargement, BPH, testis disorder*** Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (discolored hair, dry skin, erythema, paresthesia, pruritus, rash), skin dry, pruritus, sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes) Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products.

Table 2: Adverse Reactions Seen With the Use of AXIRON in either the 120 Day Clinical Trial or in the Extension to 180 Days (>4%) Event 120 Days (155 Patients) 180 Days (71 Patients) Application Site Irritation 11 (7%) 6 (8%) Application Site Erythema 8 (5%) 5 (7%) Headache 8 (5%) 4 (6%) Hematocrit Increased 6 (4%) 5 (7%) Diarrhea 4 (3%) 3 (4%) Vomiting 4 (3%) 3 (4%) PSA Increased 2 (1%) 3 (4%) Other less common adverse reactions reported by at least 2 patients in the 120 day trial included: application site edema, application site warmth, increased hemoglobin, hypertension, erythema (general), increased blood glucose, acne, nasopharyngitis, anger and anxiety. Other less common adverse reactions reported in fewer than 1% of patients in the 120 day trial included: asthenia, affect lability, folliculitis, increased lacrimation, breast tenderness, increased blood pressure, increased blood testosterone, neoplasm prostate and elevated red blood cell count. During the 120 day trial one patient discontinued treatment because of affect lability/anger which was considered possibly related to AXIRON administration. During the 120 day clinical trial there was an increase in mean PSA values of 0.13 ± 0.68 ng/mL from baseline. At the end of the 180 day extension clinical trial, there was an overall increase in mean PSA values of 0.1 ± 0.54 ng/mL. Following the 120 day study, seventy-one (71) patients entered a two-month extension study with AXIRON. Two patients (3%) had adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment during the period from Day 120 to Day 180. These reactions were: one patient with application site irritation (considered possibly related to AXIRON application) and one patient with dry skin and erythema, but not at the application site (considered not related to AXIRON administration) and application site erythema (considered possibly related to AXIRON administration). No serious adverse reactions to AXIRON were reported during either the 120 day trial, or the extension to 180 days."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to AXIRON. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. AXIRON should be discontinued until the cause of the virilization is identified (2.2, 5.2) Exogenous administration of testosterone may lead to azoospermia (5.5) Edema with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.7). Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.9) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), liver function, lipid concentrations, hematocrit and hemoglobin periodically (5.1, 5.3, 5.6, 5.10) AXIRON is flammable until dry (5.13) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with Androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating treatment. It would be appropriate to reevaluate patients 3 to 6 months after initiation of treatment, and then in accordance with prostate cancer screening practices. [See Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women have been reported with topical testosterone products applied to the abdomen or upper arms, including cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AXIRON [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone therapy should be promptly discontinued at least until the cause of virilization has been identified. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, AXIRON is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, including AXIRON, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.6 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatitis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatitis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AXIRON is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.7 Edema Androgens, including AXIRON, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.8 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AXIRON, for hypogonadism. 5.9 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity and chronic lung disease. 5.10 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.11 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including AXIRON, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.12 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including AXIRON, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentration and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentration remain unchanged, however there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.13 Flammability Alcohol based products, including AXIRON, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid smoking, fire or flame until the AXIRON dose applied has dried."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with Testim(R) 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received Testim(R) 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Patients with adverse events that were possibly or probably related to study drug and reported by >=1% of the Testim(R) patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 3.

In this clinical trial of Testim(R), six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: vertigo, coronary artery disease, depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection/pneumonia (none of which were considered related to Testim(R) administration), mood swings and hypertension. No Testim(R) patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 gm/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively. In the combined ongoing U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim(R) for at least 6 months. The preliminary results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets (see WARNINGS)."

Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with testosterone gel 1% and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. Table 2: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of Testosterone Gel 1% in the 180-Day Controlled Clinical Trial *Lab test abnormal occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. **Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. ***Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with testosterone gel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of testosterone gel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to testosterone gel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No testosterone gel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with testosterone gel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with testosterone gel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of Testosterone Gel 1% in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on testosterone gel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of testosterone gel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel 1%. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel 1% should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure (CHF), may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9, 6.2) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) Testosterone gel 1% is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age.

Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as testosterone gel 1%. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel 1% and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel 1%. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel 1% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel 1%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Endocrine and Urogenital, Female - The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus. Male - Gynecomastia, and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Cardiovascular Disorders - myocardial infarction, stroke Skin and Appendages - Hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and acne. Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances - Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium (see WARNINGS ), and inorganic phosphates. Gastrointestinal - Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests; rarely, hepatocellular neoplasms, peliosis hepatis (see WARNINGS ). Hematologic - Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X; bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy; polycythemia. Nervous System - Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia. Metabolic - Increased serum cholesterol.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo) are application site reaction and increased hematocrit (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-663-0412 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Subjects could be counted in both testosterone gel treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels. Adverse reactions reported by >=1% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions (Reported by >=1% of the Testosterone Gel Patients and Greater than Placebo) in the Controlled Clinical Trial Through 90 Days Event Testosterone Gel 50 mg (n=103) Testosterone Gel 100 mg (n=149) Placebo (n=99) Application Site Reactions 2% 4% 3% Blood Pressure Increased 1% 1% 0% Gynecomastia 1% 0% 0% Headache 1% 1% 0% Hematocrit/hemoglobin Increased 1% 2% 0% Hot Flushes 1% 0% 0% Insomnia 1% 0% 0% Mood Swings 1% 0% 0% Smell Disorder 1% 0% 0% Spontaneous Penile Erection 1% 0% 0% Taste Disorder 1% 1% 0% The following adverse reactions occurred in fewer than 1% of patients but were greater in testosterone gel groups compared to the placebo group: activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, blood creatinine increased, prothrombin time prolonged, appetite increased, sensitive nipples, and acne. In this clinical trial of testosterone gel, six patients had adverse reactions that led to their discontinuation. These events included: depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No testosterone gel patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse reaction. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined US and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received testosterone gel for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vascular Disorders Venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Cardiovascular Disorders Myocardial infarction, stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9, 6.2) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.11) Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.12) Testosterone gel is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1,8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testosterone gel is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue testosterone gel while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including testosterone gel, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after dose increases. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including testosterone gel, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the testosterone gel has dried."

Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the treatment emergent adverse reactions that were reported by either >4% of 155 patients in a 120 day, Phase 3 study or by >4% of 71 patients who continued to use AXIRON for up to 180 days. These data reflect the experience primarily with a testosterone dose of 60 mg, which was taken by all patients at the start of the study, and was the maintenance dose for 97 patients. However, the doses used varied from 30 mg to 120 mg. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Seen With the Use of AXIRON in either the 120 Day Clinical Trial or in the Extension to 180 Days (>4%) Event 120 Days (155 Patients) 180 Days (71 Patients) Application Site Irritation 11 (7%) 6 (8%) Application Site Erythema 8 (5%) 5 (7%) Headache 8 (5%) 4 (6%) Hematocrit Increased 6 (4%) 5 (7%) Diarrhea 4 (3%) 3 (4%) Vomiting 4 (3%) 3 (4%) PSA Increased 2 (1%) 3 (4%) Other less common adverse reactions reported by at least 2 patients in the 120 day trial included: application site edema, application site warmth, increased hemoglobin, hypertension, erythema (general), increased blood glucose, acne, nasopharyngitis, anger and anxiety. Other less common adverse reactions reported in fewer than 1% of patients in the 120 day trial included: asthenia, affect lability, folliculitis, increased lacrimation, breast tenderness, increased blood pressure, increased blood testosterone, neoplasm prostate and elevated red blood cell count. During the 120 day trial one patient discontinued treatment because of affect lability/anger which was considered possibly related to AXIRON administration. During the 120 day clinical trial there was an increase in mean PSA values of 0.13 ± 0.68 ng/mL from baseline. At the end of the 180 day extension clinical trial, there was an overall increase in mean PSA values of 0.1 ± 0.54 ng/mL. Following the 120 day study, seventy-one (71) patients entered a two-month extension study with AXIRON. Two patients (3%) had adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment during the period from Day 120 to Day 180. These reactions were: one patient with application site irritation (considered possibly related to AXIRON application) and one patient with dry skin and erythema, but not at the application site (considered not related to AXIRON administration) and application site erythema (considered possibly related to AXIRON administration). No serious adverse reactions to AXIRON were reported during either the 120 day trial, or the extension to 180 days. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of AXIRON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Other less common adverse reactions, reported in fewer than 1% of patients included: amnesia, anxiety, discolored hair, dizziness, dry skin, hirsutism, hostility, impaired urination, paresthesia, penis disorder, peripheral edema, sweating, and vasodilation. In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension No AndroGel patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by greater than 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 + Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine.* Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. ** Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as greater than 2X the baseline or any single serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still less than 2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA greater than 6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypogonadal Men Table 4 includes adverse reactions that have been identified postmarketing.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Worsening of BPH and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patient for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Warnings and Precaution (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Increases in serum PSA from baseline values were seen in approximately 18% of individuals in an open label study of 162 hypogonadal men treated with AndroGel for up to 42 months. Most of these increases were seen within the first year of therapy [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Testosterone Transfer to Others Transfer of testosterone to others (including women and children) can occur when vigorous skin-to-skin contact is made with the application site [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The following precautions are recommended to minimize potential transfer of testosterone from AndroGel-treated skin to another person: Patients should wash their hands immediately with soap and water after application of AndroGel. Patients should cover the application site(s) with clothing after the gel has dried (e.g., a shirt). In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which AndroGel has been applied does come in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible. In vitro studies show that residual testosterone is removed from the skin surface by washing with soap and water. Women and children should avoid skin contact with AndroGel application sites in males. Changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization should be brought to the attention of a physician. AndroGel may cause fetal harm in a pregnant woman due to virilization of a female fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.3 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.4 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.5 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel is not known to produce these adverse effects. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term oral therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. 5.6 Edema Drugs in the androgen class may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel, for hypogonadism. 5.8 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk for a thromboembolic event. Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Androgens should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.10 Flammable until Dry Alcohol Based Products including AndroGel are flammable; therefore avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 5%) is an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie Inc. at 1-800-633-9110 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA >4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving AndroGel 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value >4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing. During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by >2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the AndroGel 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the AndroGel 1.62% treated group versus placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients in the 182-Day, Double-Blind Period of AndroGel 1.62% Clinical Trial * PSA increased includes: PSA values that met pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values (an average change from baseline > 0.75 ng/mL and/or an average PSA value >4.0 ng/mL based on two measurements) as well as those reported as adverse events. ** Emotional lability includes: mood swings, affective disorder, impatience, anger, and aggression. *** Contact dermatitis includes: 4 patients with dermatitis at non-application sites. Number (%) of Patients Adverse Reaction AndroGel 1.62% N=234 Placebo N=40 PSA increased* 26 (11.1%) 0% Emotional lability** 6 (2.6%) 0% Hypertension 5 (2.1%) 0% Hematocrit or hemoglobin increased 5 (2.1%) 0% Contact dermatitis*** 5 (2.1%) 0% Other adverse reactions occurring in less than or equal to 2% of AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients and more frequently than placebo included: frequent urination, and hyperlipidemia. In the open-label period of the study (N=191), the most commonly reported adverse reaction (experienced by greater than 2% of patients) was increased PSA (n=13; 6.2%) and sinusitis. Other adverse reactions reported by less than or equal to 2% of patients included increased hemoglobin or hematocrit, hypertension, acne, libido decreased, insomnia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, 25 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (10.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 17 patients with PSA increased and 1 report each of: hematocrit increased, blood pressure increased, frequent urination, diarrhea, fatigue, pituitary tumor, dizziness, skin erythema and skin nodule (same patient - neither at application site), vasovagal syncope, and diabetes mellitus. During the 182-day, open-label period, 9 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 6 reports of PSA increased, 2 of hematocrit increased, and 1 each of triglycerides increased and prostate cancer. Application Site Reactions In the 182-day double-blind period of the study, application site reactions were reported in two (2/234; 0.9%) patients receiving AndroGel 1.62%, both of which resolved. Neither of these patients discontinued the study due to application site adverse reactions. In the open-label period of the study, application site reactions were reported in three (3/219; 1.4%) additional patients that were treated with AndroGel 1.62%. None of these subjects were discontinued from the study due to application site reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 5). Table 5: Adverse Reactions from Post Approval Experience of AndroGel 1% by System Organ Class * Impaired urination includes nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream ** Lab test abnormal includes elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, or elevated serum creatinine *** Testis disorder includes atrophy or non-palpable testis, varicocele, testis sensitivity or tenderness System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, polycythemia, anemia Cardiovascular disorders: Myocardial infarction, stroke Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination* Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests Investigations: Lab test abnormal**, elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium [includes hypokalemia], phosphorus, sodium), impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, HDL, fluctuating testosterone levels, weight increase Neoplasms: Prostate cancer Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, insomnia, sleep apnea Psychiatric disorders: Amnesia, anxiety, depression, hostility, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections), prostate enlargement, BPH, testis disorder*** Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (discolored hair, dry skin, erythema, paresthesia, pruritus, rash), skin dry, pruritus, sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes), venous thromboembolism Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to AndroGel 1.62%. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. AndroGel 1.62% should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) AndroGel 1.62% is flammable until dry (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AndroGel 1.62% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as AndroGel 1.62%. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with AndroGel 1.62% and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use AndroGel 1.62%. 5.6 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel 1.62% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH possibly leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel 1.62% is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including AndroGel 1.62 %, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol based products, including AndroGel 1.62%, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the AndroGel 1.62% has dried."

These events included: depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No Testim patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse reaction. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined US and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Vascular Disorders Venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to Testim. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testim should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.6) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.8, 6.2) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.10) Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.11) Testim is flammable until dry. (5.14) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using Testim [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as Testim. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Testim and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, Testim is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.6 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Testim, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.7 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testim is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Testim while the cause is evaluated. 5.8 Edema Androgens, including Testim, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.9 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.11 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after dose increases. 5.12 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Testim, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.13 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Testim, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.14 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including Testim, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the Testim has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions, occurring in > 1% of patients, are gum or mouth irritation, bitter taste, gum pain, gum tenderness, headache, gum edema and taste perversion. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actient Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-877-663-0412 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug can not be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Twelve Week Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men In the Phase 3, open-label study, 98 patients received Striant for up to 12 weeks. Adverse reactions to Striant reported by >=1% of patients are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Observed With the Use of Striant in >=1% of Patients Adverse Reaction Striant (n=98) Gum or Mouth Irritation 9.2% Taste Bitter 4.1% Gum Pain 3.1% Gum Tenderness 3.1% Headache 3.1% Gum Edema 2.0% Taste Perversion 2.0% Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days [see Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations in Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The following adverse reactions to Striant occurred in 1 patient each: acne, anxiety, breast enlargement, breast pain, buccal mucosal roughening, difficulty in micturition, fatigue, gingivitis, gum blister, gustatory sense diminished, hematocrit increased, lipids serum increased, liver function tests abnormal, nose edema, stinging of lips, and toothache. There was one additional 12-week study in 12 patients. In this study, additional adverse reactions to Striant and reported by 1 patient each included emotional lability and hypertension. Long-Term Extension Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men In two extension trials, a total of 117 and 51 patients received Striant for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Of 117 patients treated for at least 6 months, adverse reactions reported by 1 patient each included: anxiety, buccal inflammation, depression, dry mouth, gum redness, hypertension, infection, medication error, nausea, pruritus, renal function abnormal, stomatitis, taste bitter, taste perversion and toothache. Polycythemia and increased serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were reported in three and two patients, respectively. In these two extension studies, a total of 48 patients received Striant for at least 2 years. In these patients, adverse reactions included: gingival recession, lip ulceration, stomatitis, rash, prostate cancer, increased PSA, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypertension aggravated, headache, nervousness, polycythemia, taste perversion, aggressiveness, hyperlipidemia, peripheral edema, and anxiety. Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations In the open-label study, all reported gum-related adverse events were collected and gum examinations were conducted at Baseline and every month thereafter. A total of 16 patients reported 19 gum-related adverse reactions. Of these, ten patients (10.2%) reported 12 reactions of mild intensity, four patients (4.1%) reported 5 reactions of moderate intensity, and two patients (2.0%) reported 2 reactions of severe intensity. Four patients (4.1%) discontinued treatment with Striant due to gum or mouth-related adverse reactions including two with severe gum irritation, one with mouth irritation, and one with "bad taste in mouth." Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days. Monthly gum examinations were conducted to assess for gingivitis, gum edema, oral lesions, ulcerations or leukoplakia. No cases of ulceration or leukoplakia were observed. No new oral lesions were observed. The incidence of gingivitis and gum edema was not increased during treatment. In the two extension trials, gum examinations were conducted every 3 months while on treatment. In one of these trials, no patient had a gum abnormality, and in the other trial, moderate gingivitis and mild gum edema were reported by 1 patient each. In these two extension studies, patient-reported information on Striant gum adherence was collected every 3 months for 1 year. At each visit, 37% to 52% of patients reported problems with Striant adhering to the gum. Circumstances surrounding Striant detachment included eating, drinking and oral care. Hot foods and hot beverages were more likely to be associated with detachment than cold food and cold beverages. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Striant. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: dry mouth, gingival swelling, lip swelling, mouth ulceration, stomatitis, red blood cell increased, dysgeusia, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gum-related adverse reactions: Instruct patients to regularly inspect their gum region where Striant is applied. (5.1) Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Women and children should not use Striant (5.6) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.2, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) 5.1 Gum-Related Adverse Reactions and Limited Long-Term Information on Oral Safety Gum-related adverse reactions, including severe gum irritation, were reported in clinical trials of Striant. Long-term clinical trial data on gum safety is available in only a limited number of patients (117 patients, 51 patients and 48 patients with at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years of exposure, respectively). It is recommended that patients regularly inspect their own gum region where Striant is applied. Any abnormal finding should be brought promptly to the attention of the patient's physician. In such circumstances, dental consultation may be appropriate. 5.2 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration.

Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Striant and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Striant. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, Striant is not indicated for use in women. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Striant, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice).

Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Striant while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including Striant, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including Striant, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Striant, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria).

Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Testim, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including Testim, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the Testim has dried."

Anticoagulants: C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirements of patients receiving oral anticoagulants. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when androgens are started or stopped. 2. Oxyphenbutazone: Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. 3. Insulin: In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements. 4. ACTH and corticosteroids: Enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Endocrine and Urogenital: Female: The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of external genitalia of the female fetus. Male: Gynecomastia, and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Skin and appendages: Hirsutism, male pattern of baldness, and acne. Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances: Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium, and inorganic phosphates. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests, rarely hepatocellular neoplasms and peliosis hepatis (See WARNINGS). Hematologic: Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X, bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy, and polycythemia. Nervous System: Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia. Metabolic: Increased serum cholesterol. Miscellaneous: Inflammation and pain at the site of intramuscular injection and, rarely, anaphylactoid reactions."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%) are acne, application site reactions, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse reactions with testosterone gel and reported by > 1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. *Abnormal lab tests occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. **Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. ***Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis. Other less common adverse reactions, reported in fewer than 1% of patients included: amnesia, anxiety, discolored hair, dizziness, dry skin, hirsutism, hostility, impaired urination, paresthesia, penis disorder, peripheral edema, sweating, and vasodilation. In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with testosterone gel, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of testosterone gel. These reactions included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion, depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No patients on testosterone gel discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse reactions; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse reactions to testosterone gel and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3: +Abnormal lab tests occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Two patients reported serious adverse reactions considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse reactions in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on testosterone gel in the 3 year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as > 2X the baseline or any single serum PSA > 6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still < 2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA > 6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. Table 2 Table 3 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of testosterone gel. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4): Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarket surveillance. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Table 4"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1). -Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilzation. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified (5.2). -Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4). -Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy (5.5). -Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.7). -Edema, with or without congestive heart failure (CHF), may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic diseases (5.9, 6.2). -Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.11). -Monitor serum testosterone, prostatic specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12). -Testosterone gel is flammable until dry (5.15). 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer -Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. -Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4), Adverse reactions (6.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of testosterone gel. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel; spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testosterone gel is not known to produce these adverse effects. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including testosterone gel, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including testosterone gel, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.12 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel, may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol based products including testosterone gel are flammable; therefore patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the testosterone gel has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence >= 5%) is an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie Inc. at 1-800-633-9110 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AndroGel 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with AndroGel 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA >4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving AndroGel 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value >4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing. During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value > 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported by >2% of patients in the 182-day, double-blind period of the AndroGel 1.62% clinical trial and more frequent in the AndroGel 1.62% treated group versus placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Patients in the 182-Day, Double-Blind Period of AndroGel 1.62% Clinical Trial * PSA increased includes: PSA values that met pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values (an average change from baseline > 0.75 ng/mL and/or an average PSA value >4.0 ng/mL based on two measurements) as well as those reported as adverse events. ** Emotional lability includes: mood swings, affective disorder, impatience, anger, and aggression. *** Contact dermatitis includes: 4 patients with dermatitis at non-application sites.

In the open-label period of the study (N=191), the most commonly reported adverse reaction (experienced by greater than 2% of patients) was increased PSA (n=13; 6.2%) and sinusitis. Other adverse reactions reported by less than or equal to 2% of patients included increased hemoglobin or hematocrit, hypertension, acne, libido decreased, insomnia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, 25 AndroGel 1.62%-treated patients (10.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 17 patients with PSA increased and 1 report each of: hematocrit increased, blood pressure increased, frequent urination, diarrhea, fatigue, pituitary tumor, dizziness, skin erythema and skin nodule (same patient - neither at application site), vasovagal syncope, and diabetes mellitus. During the 182-day, open-label period, 9 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These adverse reactions included 6 reports of PSA increased, 2 of hematocrit increased, and 1 each of triglycerides increased and prostate cancer. Application Site Reactions In the 182-day double-blind period of the study, application site reactions were reported in two (2/234; 0.9%) patients receiving AndroGel 1.62%, both of which resolved. Neither of these patients discontinued the study due to application site adverse reactions. In the open-label period of the study, application site reactions were reported in three (3/219; 1.4%) additional patients that were treated with AndroGel 1.62%. None of these subjects were discontinued from the study due to application site reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 5).

Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.9 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, for hypogonadism. 5.10 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.11 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.12 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including AndroGel 1.62 %, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.13 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including AndroGel 1.62%, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.14 Flammability Alcohol based products, including AndroGel 1.62%, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the AndroGel 1.62% has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo) are application site reactions and increased hematocrit. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact UPSHER-SMITH LABORATORIES, INC. at 1-855-899-9180 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a controlled clinical study, 304 patients were treated with testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days. Two hundred-five (205) patients received testosterone gel 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo. Subjects could be counted in both testosterone gel treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels. Adverse reactions reported by >=1% of the testosterone gel patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Incidence of Adverse Reactions (Reported by >=1% of the Testosterone Gel Patients and Greater than Placebo) in the Controlled Clinical Trial Through 90 Days Event Testosterone Gel 50 mg (n=103) Testosterone Gel 100 mg (n=149) Placebo (n=99) Application Site Reactions 2% 4% 3% Blood Pressure Increased 1% 1% 0% Gynecomastia 1% 0% 0% Headache 1% 1% 0% Hematocrit/Hemoglobin Increased 1% 2% 0% Hot Flushes 1% 0% 0% Insomnia 1% 0% 0% Mood Swings 1% 0% 0% Smell Disorder 1% 0% 0% Spontaneous Penile Erection 1% 0% 0% Taste Disorder 1% 1% 0% The following adverse reactions occurred in fewer than 1% of patients but were greater in testosterone gel groups compared to the placebo group: activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, blood creatinine increased, prothrombin time prolonged, appetite increased, sensitive nipples, and acne. In this clinical trial of testosterone gel, six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection, mood swings and hypertension. No testosterone gel patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 g/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively, compared to 1.0% and 1.5% of patients in the placebo group, respectively. In the combined U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received testosterone gel for at least 6 months. The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or of the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabrics, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Cardiovascular Disorders: Myocardial infarction, stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Vascular Disorders: Venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor prostate specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.12) Testosterone gel is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Men with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report signs and symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevate blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testosterone gel is not known to produce these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue testosterone gel while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including testosterone gel, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after any dose increases. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol-based products, including testosterone gel, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried."

Table 1 shows the adverse reactions that were reported by > 3% of 36 hypogonadal men who were treated with ANDRODERM 2 mg/day, 4 mg/day, or 6 mg/day for 28 days. Of note, all hypogonadal men studied had been stable users of topical testosterone replacement products prior to the study and there was no washout period between therapies. Furthermore, there was only one subject titrated to 6 mg/day and he withdrew from the study prematurely. Table 1.

The overall incidence of application site reactions of any kind was 28% (10 subjects with 13 adverse reactions). No serious adverse reactions to ANDRODERM 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day were reported during the clinical trial. Table 2 shows the adverse reactions that were reported in > 3% of 122 patients in clinical studies with ANDRODERM dosage strengths of 2.5 mg/day, 5 mg/day, and 7.5 mg/day. The most common adverse reactions reported were application site reactions. Transient mild to moderate erythema was observed at the site of application in the majority of patients at some time during treatment. The overall incidence of application site reactions of any kind was 48% (59 subjects with 107 adverse reactions). Table 2. Adverse Reactions Seen With the Use of ANDRODERM 2.5 mg/day, 5 mg/day, or 7.5 mg/day (> 3%) Adverse Reaction Overall N = 122 % Application site pruritus 37 Application site blistering 12 Application site erythema 7 Application site vesicles 6 Prostate abnormalities 5 Headache 4 Contact dermatitis to system 4 Application site burning 3 Application site induration 3 Depression 3 The following reactions occurred in less than 3% of patients: rash, gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, body pain, pelvic pain, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, increased appetite, accelerated growth, anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, paresthesia, thinking abnormalities, vertigo, acne, bullae at application site, mechanical irritation at application site, rash at application site, contamination of application site, prostate carcinoma, dysuria, hematuria, impotence, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, and testicular abnormalities. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ANDRODERM. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to the use of Striant(R) and reported by >/= 1% of patients in Study 1 are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Incidences of Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related Use of Striant(R) in Study 1 Adverse event Striant(R) (n=98) Gum or Mouth Irritation 9.2% Taste Bitter 4.1% Gum Pain 3.1% Gum Tenderness 3.1% Headache 3.1% Gum Edema 2.0% Taste Perversion 2.0% Please see \"Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations\" subsection for further information. The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days. The following adverse events judged possibly, probably or definitely related to the use of Striant(R) occurred in 1 patient each in Study 1: abdominal cramp, acne, anxiety, asthma (acute), breast enlargement, breast pain, buccal mucosal roughening, difficulty in micturition, fatigue, gingivitis, gum blister, gustatory sense diminished, hematocrit increased, lipids serum increased, liver function tests abnormal, nose edema, stinging of lips, and toothache. There was one additional 12-week study in 12 patients. In this study, additional adverse events judged at least possibly related to Striant(R) and reported by 1 patient each included emotional lability and hypertension. Long-Term Extension Trials In two long-term extension trials, a total of 117 and 51 patients received Striant(R) for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Of 117 patients treated for at least 6 months, adverse events judged possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and reported by 1 patient each included: anxiety, buccal inflammation, depression, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disorder, gum redness, hypertension, infection, medication error, nausea, pruritis, renal function abnormal, stomatitis, taste bitter, taste perversion, and toothache. Polycythemia and increased serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were reported in three and two patients, respectively. Adverse events reported in the 51 patients treated for at least one year were similar to those reported after 6 months of treatment and lower in incidence. Gum-related adverse events and gum examinations In the pivotal controlled study (Study 1), all reported gum-related adverse events were collected and gum examinations were conducted at Baseline and every month thereafter. In Study 1, a total of 16 patients reported 19 gum-related adverse events. Of these, ten patients (10.2%) reported 12 events of mild intensity, four patients (4.1%) reported 5 events of moderate intensity, and two patients (2.0%) reported 2 events of severe intensity. Most of these events were judged probably or definitely related to treatment with Striant(R). Four patients (4.1%) discontinued treatment with Striant(R) due to gum or mouth-related adverse events including two with severe gum irritation, one with mouth irritation, and one with \"bad taste in mouth\". The majority of gum-related adverse events were transient. Gum irritation generally resolved in 1 to 8 days. Gum tenderness resolved in 1 to 14 days. In Study 1, monthly gum examinations were conducted to assess for gingivitis, gum edema, oral lesions, ulcerations or leukoplakia. No cases of ulceration or leukoplakia were observed. No new oral lesions were observed. Gingivitis was common at Baseline (32.6%), and was reduced at Week 4 (10.2%), Week 8 (10.2%) and Week 12 (11.2%). Similar findings were seen for gum edema. In the two long-term extension trials, gum examinations were conducted every 3 months while on treatment. In one of these trials, no patient had a gum abnormality, and in the other trial, moderate gingivitis and mild gum edema were reported by 1 patient each."

Oxymetazoline A 2.6% decrease in mean AUC(0-24) and 3.6% decrease in mean Cmax of total testosterone was observed in males with symptomatic seasonal rhinitis when treated with oxymetazoline 30 minutes prior to Natesto compared to when left untreated. Oxymetazoline does not impact the absorption of testosterone when concomitantly administered with Natesto [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Drug interaction potential with other nasally administered drugs other than oxymetazoline has not been studied."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=3%) are: PSA increased, headache, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and nasal scab. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Endo Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-462-3636 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Natesto was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, 90-day clinical study. Patients could continue treatment with Natesto in two, open-label extension periods for an additional 90 and 180 days, respectively. A total of 306 hypogonadal men with morning testosterone concentrations <= 300 ng/dL received Natesto. Of these, 78 received Natesto at a dose of 11 mg three times daily. 90-Day Clinical Study Among the 78 patients who received Natesto three times daily in the 90-day clinical study, the most common adverse reactions were: prostate specific antigen (PSA) increased, headache, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URI), sinusitis, bronchitis and nasal scab. PSA increased was considered an adverse reaction by meeting one of two pre-specified criteria: (1) increase from baseline serum PSA greater than 1.4 ug/L, or (2) serum PSA greater than 4.0 ug/L. Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported by >=3% of patients treated with 11 mg three times daily in the 90-day clinical study.

Among these 18 patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in more than one patient each: nasopharyngitis, parosmia, PSA increased, nasal discomfort, nasal scab and hypertension. The following adverse reactions were reported in one patient each: nausea, nasal excoriation, thyroid stimulating hormone increased, decreased appetite, myalgia, anosmia, testicular atrophy, epistaxis, nasal septum disorder, nasal discomfort, and rhinorrhea. In patients who received Natesto three times daily, mean serum PSA concentrations increased by 0.2 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, and 0.2 ng/mL after 90, 180 and 360 days, respectively. Discontinuations due to Adverse Reactions Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, a total of 6 subjects withdrew from treatment for the following adverse reactions, reported by 1 subject each: nasal discomfort, headache, dysgeusia, PSA increased, allergic reaction (hives, swollen lips and tongue), and 1 patient with myalgia, arthralgia, fever, chills and petechiae. Increased Hematocrit Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, a total of 4 subjects had a hematocrit level > 55%. These 4 patients had baseline hematocrits of 48% and 51%. In no case did hematocrit exceed 58%. Nasal Adverse Reactions Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, the following nasal adverse reactions were reported: nasopharyngitis (8.2%), rhinorrhea (7.8%), epistaxis (6.5%), nasal discomfort (5.9%), parosmia (5.2%), nasal scab (5.2%), upper respiratory infection (4.2%), nasal dryness (4.2%), and nasal congestion (3.9%). 6.2. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Disorders : myocardial infarction, stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. V ascular Disorders : Venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Nasal adverse reactions: Instruct patients to report any nasal symptoms or signs (5.1) Not recommended for use in patients with chronic nasal conditions or alterations in nasal anatomy. (5.2) Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.3) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.5) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.6) Women and children should not use Natesto. (5.7) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.8) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.10) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.12) Monitor prostate-specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.3, 5.4, 5.13) 5.1. Nasal Adverse Reactions and Limited Long-Term Information on Nasal Safety Nasal adverse reactions, including nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort and nasal scabbing, were reported in the clinical trial experience with Natesto. All nasal adverse reactions except one (a single case of upper respiratory infection) were reported as mild or moderate in severity; however, long-term clinical trial data on nasal safety is available in a limited number of subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. Patients should be instructed to report any nasal symptoms or signs to their health care professional. In that circumstance, health care professionals should determine whether further evaluation (e.g., otorhinolaryngology consultation) or discontinuation of Natesto is appropriate. 5.2. Use in Patients with Chronic Nasal Conditions and Alterations in Nasal Anatomy Due to lack of clinical data on the safety or efficacy, Natesto is not recommended for use in the following patients: History of nasal disorders; History of nasal or sinus surgery; History of nasal fracture within the previous 6 months or nasal fracture that caused a deviated anterior nasal septum; Mucosal inflammatory disorders (e.g, Sjogren's syndrome); and Sinus disease. 5.3. Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate patients 3 to 6 months after initiation of treatment and then in accordance with prostate cancer screening practices [see Contraindications (4 )]. 5.4. Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of Natesto . Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.5. Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events , including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as Natesto. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for (DVT) and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Natesto and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2 )]. 5.6 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Natesto. 5.7. Use in Women Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, Natesto is not indicated for use in women. 5.8. Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Natesto, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters, including sperm count. 5.9. Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatitis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatitis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Natesto is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Natesto while the cause is evaluated. 5.10. Edema Androgens, including Natesto, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.11. Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including Natesto, for hypogonadism.[see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. 5.12. Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity and chronic lung disease. 5.13. Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy. Changes in serum lipid profile may require discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.14. Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Natesto, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.15. Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Natesto, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged; however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction."

Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. Table 2: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel 1% in the 180-Day Controlled Clinical Trial *Lab test abnormal occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. **Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. ***Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No AndroGel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel 1% in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness.

Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4). Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions from Postmarketing Experience of AndroGel 1% by MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Elevated Hgb, Hct (polycythemia) Cardiovascular disorders: Myocardial infarction, stroke Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders and administration site reactions: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests (e.g. transaminases, elevated GGTP, bilirubin) Investigations: Elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium), changes in serum lipids (hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, decreased HDL), impaired glucose tolerance, fluctuating testosterone concentrations, weight increase Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (cysts and polyps): Prostate cancer Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, sleep apnea, insomnia Psychiatric disorders: Depression, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness, hostility, amnesia, anxiety Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, prostatic enlargement, testicular atrophy, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections) Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (pruritus, dry skin, erythema, rash, discolored hair, paresthesia), sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes), venous thromboembolism Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarket surveillance. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to AndroGel 1%. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. AndroGel 1% should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema, with or without congestive heart failure (CHF), may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9, 6.2) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests, and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) AndroGel 1% is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AndroGel 1% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as AndroGel 1%. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with AndroGel 1% and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use AndroGel 1%. 5.6 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel 1% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including AndroGel 1%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice).

More frequent monitoring of INR and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking anticoagulants, especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 5%) are acne, application site reaction, abnormal lab tests, and prostatic disorders (6). Cases of testosterone secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported (6.2). Reported signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, premature development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel (5.2, 6.2). In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Abbott Laboratories at 1-800-241-1643 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. Table 2: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel in the 180-Day Controlled Clinical Trial *Lab test abnormal occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. **Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. ***Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No AndroGel patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients. There were two with a non-palpable testis and one with slight right testicular tenderness. Lab Test Abnormal+ 9.3 Skin dry 1.9 Application Site Reaction 5.6 Acne 3.1 Pruritus 1.9 Enlarged Prostate 11.7 Carcinoma of Prostate 1.2 Urinary Symptoms* 3.7 Testis Disorder** 1.9 Gynecomastia 2.5 Anemia 2.5 Two patients reported serious adverse events considered possibly related to treatment: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and prostate disorder requiring a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarket surveillance. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypogonadal Men Table 4 includes adverse reactions that have been identified postmarketing. Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions from Postmarketing Experience of AndroGel by MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Elevated Hgb, Hct (polycythemia) Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders and administration site reactions: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests (e.g. transaminases, elevated GGTP, bilirubin) Investigations: Elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium), changes in serum lipids (hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, decreased HDL), impaired glucose tolerance, fluctuating testosterone levels, weight increase Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (cysts and polyps): Prostate cancer Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, sleep apnea, insomnia Psychiatric disorders: Depression, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness, hostility, amnesia, anxiety Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, prostatic enlargement, testicular atrophy, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections) Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (pruritus, dry skin, erythema, rash, discolored hair, paresthesia), sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.1). Secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women can occur with use of testosterone gel (5.2). Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported (6.2). Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application site(s) in men using testosterone gel. To minimize the potential for transfer to others, patients using AndroGel should apply the product as directed and strictly adhere to the following (5.2): Wash hands with soap and water after application. Cover the application site with clothing after the gel has dried. Wash the application site thoroughly with soap and water prior to any situation where skin-to-skin contact of the application site with another person is anticipated. Signs of virilization in children and women and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should be brought to the attention of the healthcare provider. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of the virilization is identified (5.2). Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women (5.3). Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.4). Edema may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.6, 6.2). Gynecomastia, enlargement of breast, may develop (5.7). Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.8). Monitor serum testosterone, prostatic specific antigen, hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function test, and lipid levels periodically (2.3, 5.1, 5.9). Alcohol-based gels are flammable until dry (5.10). 5.1 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patient for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate. Increases in serum PSA from baseline values were seen in approximately 18% of individuals in an open label study of 162 hypogonadal men treated with AndroGel for up to 42 months. Most of these increases were seen within the first year of therapy [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women can occur with testosterone gel use in men [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of testosterone gel. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. Testosterone may cause fetal harm in a pregnant woman due to virilization of a female fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Strict adherence to the following precautions is advised in order to minimize the potential for secondary exposure to testosterone from AndroGel-treated skin: Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application site(s) of men using testosterone gel. AndroGel should only be applied to the shoulders, upper arms, and/or abdomen (area of application should be limited to the area that will be covered by the patient's short sleeve t-shirt). Patients should wash their hands immediately with soap and water after applying AndroGel. Patients should cover the application site(s) with clothing (e.g., a shirt) after the gel has dried. Prior to any situation in which skin-to-skin contact with the application site is anticipated, patients should wash the application site(s) thoroughly with soap and water to remove any testosterone residue. In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which AndroGel has been applied comes in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible. Studies show that residual testosterone is removed from the skin surface by washing with soap and water. 5.3 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel is not indicated for use in women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.4 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.5 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel is not known to produce these adverse effects. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term oral therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. 5.6 Edema Drugs in the androgen class may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.7 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel, for hypogonadism. 5.8 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.9 Laboratory Tests Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk for a thromboembolic event. Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Androgens should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.10 Flammable Until Dry Alcohol Based Products including AndroGel are flammable; therefore avoid fire, flame or smoking until the gel has dried."

In this clinical trial of Testim(R), six patients had adverse events that led to their discontinuation. These events included: vertigo, coronary artery disease, depression with suicidal ideation, urinary tract infection/pneumonia (none of which were considered related to Testim(R) administration), mood swings and hypertension. No Testim(R) patients discontinued due to skin reaction. In one foreign Phase 3 trial, one subject discontinued due to a skin-related adverse event. In the pivotal U.S. and European Phase 3 trials combined, at the 50 mg dosage strength, the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo. However, in the 100 mg dose group, 2.3% and 2.8% of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin (>= 19 gm/dL) or hematocrit (>= 58%), respectively. In the combined ongoing U.S. and European open label extension studies, approximately 140 patients received Testim(R) for at least 6 months. The preliminary results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the U.S. controlled clinical trial. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone gel products. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and Appendages - Hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and acne. Cardiovascular Disorders - Myocardial infarction, stroke. Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances - Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium (see WARNINGS ), and inorganic phosphates. Gastrointestinal - Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests; rarely, hepatocellular neoplasms, peliosis hepatis (see WARNINGS ). Hematologic - Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X; bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy; polycythemia. Nervous System - Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia. Metabolic - Increased serum cholesterol.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. (5.1) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. (5.2) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.4) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.5) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. (5.7) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. (5.9) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. (5.11) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically. (5.1, 5.3, 5.8, 5.12) Testosterone gel is flammable until dry. (5.15) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patients for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been Postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Testosterone gel is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including testosterone gel, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including testosterone gel, for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.12 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Flammability Alcohol based products, including testosterone gel, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid smoking, fire or flame until the testosterone gel has dried."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=2%) are acne, injection site pain, prostatic specific antigen (PSA) increased, estradiol increased, hypogonadism, fatigue, irritability, hemoglobin increased, insomnia, and mood swings (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Endo Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-462-3636 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Aveed was evaluated in an 84-week clinical study using a dose regimen of 750 mg (3 mL) at initiation, at 4 weeks, and every 10 weeks thereafter in 153 hypogonadal men. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>2%) were: acne (5.2%), injection site pain (4.6%), prostate specific antigen increased (4.6%), hypogonadism (2.6%) and estradiol increased (2.6%). Table 1 presents adverse reactions reported by >=1% of patients in the 84-week clinical study. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 1% of Patients in the 84-Week Clinical Study of Aveed MedDRA Preferred term Number of patients (%) Aveed 750 mg (N=153) Acne 8 (5.2%) Injection site pain 7 (4.6%) Prostatic specific antigen increased* 7 (4.6%) Estradiol increased 4 (2.6%) Hypogonadism 4 (2.6%) Fatigue 3 (2%) Irritability 3 (2%) Hemoglobin increased 3 (2%) Insomnia 3 (2%) Mood swings 3 (2%) Aggression 2 (1.3%) Ejaculation disorder 2 (1.3%) Injection site erythema 2 (1.3%) Hematocrit increased 2 (1.3%) Hyperhidrosis 2 (1.3%) Prostate Cancer 2 (1.3%) Prostate induration 2 (1.3%) Weight increased 2 (1.3%) * Prostate specific antigen increased defined as a serum PSA concentration >4 ng/mL. In the 84-week clinical trial, 7 patients (4.6%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation included: hematocrit increased, estradiol increased, prostatic specific antigen increased, prostate cancer, mood swings, prostatic dysplasia, acne, and deep vein thrombosis. During the 84-week clinical trial, the average serum PSA increased from 1.0 ± 0.8 ng/mL at baseline to 1.5 ±1.3 ng/mL at the end of study. Fourteen patients (10.9%) in whom the baseline PSA was < 4 ng/mL had a post-baseline serum PSA of > 4 ng/mL during the 84-week treatment period. A total of 725 hypogonadal men received intramuscular testosterone undecanoate in a total of 7 controlled clinical trials. In these clinical trials, the dose and dose frequency of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate varied from 750 mg to 1000 mg, and from every 9 weeks to every 14 weeks. Several of these clinical trials incorporated additional doses upon initiation of therapy (e.g., loading doses). In addition to those adverse reactions noted in Table 1, the following adverse events were reported by at least 3% of patients in these trials, irrespective of the investigator's assessment of relationship to study medication: sinusitis, prostatitis, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, back pain, hypertension, diarrhea and headache. Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) and Anaphylaxis in Controlled Clinical Studies Adverse events attributable to pulmonary oil microembolism and anaphylaxis were reported in a small number of patients in controlled clinical trials. In the 84-week clinical trial of Aveed, 1 patient experienced a mild coughing fit lasting 10 minutes after his third injection, which was retrospectively attributed to POME. In another clinical trial of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (1000 mg), a hypogonadal male patient experienced the urge to cough and respiratory distress at 1 minute after his tenth injection, which was also retrospectively attributed to POME. During a review that involved adjudication of all cases meeting specific criteria, 9 POME events in 8 patients and 2 events of anaphylaxis among 3,556 patients treated with intramuscular testosterone undecanoate in 18 clinical trials were judged to have occurred. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Aveed. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) and Anaphylaxis Serious pulmonary oil microembolism (POME) reactions, involving cough, urge to cough, dyspnea, hyperhidrosis, throat tightening, chest pain, dizziness, and syncope, have been reported to occur during or immediately after the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg (4 mL) in post-approval use outside the United States. The majority of these events lasted a few minutes and resolved with supportive measures; however, some lasted up to several hours and some required emergency care and/or hospitalization. In addition to serious POME reactions, episodes of anaphylaxis, including life-threatening reactions, have also been reported to occur following the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate in post-approval use outside of the United States. Both serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis have been reported to occur after any injection of testosterone undecanoate during the course of therapy, including after the first dose. Other Events The following treatment emergent adverse events or adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing clinical trials and during post-approval use outside the United States of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. In most cases, the dose being used was 1000 mg.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH (5.3). Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. (5.5) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. (5.6) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia (5.8). Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease (5.10). Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors (5.12). Monitor prostatic specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lipid concentrations periodically (5.3, 5.4, 5.13). 5.1 Serious Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) Reactions and Anaphylaxis Serious POME reactions, involving cough, urge to cough, dyspnea, hyperhidrosis, throat tightening, chest pain, dizziness, and syncope, have been reported to occur during or immediately after the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg (4 mL). The majority of these events lasted a few minutes and resolved with supportive measures; however, some lasted up to several hours and some required emergency care and/or hospitalization. To minimize the risk of intravascular injection of Aveed, care should be taken to inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the recommended procedure for intramuscular administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In addition to serious POME reactions, episodes of anaphylaxis, including life-threatening reactions, have also been reported to occur following the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. Both serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis can occur after any injection of testosterone undecanoate during the course of therapy, including after the first dose. Patients with suspected hypersensitivity reactions to Aveed should not be re-treated with Aveed. Following each injection of Aveed, observe patients in the healthcare setting for 30 minutes in order to provide appropriate medical treatment in the event of serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis. 5.2 Aveed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program Aveed is available only through a restricted program called the Aveed REMS Program because of the risk of serious POME and anaphylaxis. Notable requirements of the Aveed REMS Program include the following: Healthcare providers who prescribe Aveed must be certified with the REMS Program before ordering or dispensing Aveed. Healthcare settings must be certified with the REMS Program and have healthcare providers who are certified before ordering or dispensing Aveed. Healthcare settings must have on-site access to equipment and personnel trained to manage serious POME and anaphylaxis. Further information is available at www.AveedREMS.com or call 1-855-755-0494. 5.3 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.5 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as Aveed. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Aveed and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.6 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Aveed. 5.7 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, Aveed is not indicated for use in women. 5.8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Aveed, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.9 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Aveed is not known to produce these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Aveed while the cause is evaluated. 5.10 Edema Androgens, including Aveed, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.11 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.12 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone products may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.13 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment of lipid lowering drugs or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.14 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Aveed, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.15 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Aveed, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction."

Clinical Trials in Hypogonadal Men Table 2 shows the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by >1% of patients in a 180 Day, Phase 3 study. Table 2: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel 1% in the 180-Day Controlled Clinical Trial *Lab test abnormal occurred in nine patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, hypokalemia, decreased HDL, elevated glucose, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin. **Prostate disorders included five patients with enlarged prostate, one with BPH, and one with elevated PSA results. ***Testis disorders were reported in two patients: one with left varicocele and one with slight sensitivity of left testis.

In this 180 day clinical trial, skin reactions at the site of application were reported with AndroGel 1%, but none was severe enough to require treatment or discontinuation of drug. Six patients (4%) in this trial had adverse events that led to discontinuation of AndroGel 1%. These events included: cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion (neither of which were considered related to AndroGel 1% administration), depression, sadness, memory loss, elevated prostate specific antigen, and hypertension. No AndroGel 1% patient discontinued due to skin reactions. In a separate uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study of 10 patients, two had adverse events associated with AndroGel 1%; these were asthenia and depression in one patient and increased libido and hyperkinesia in the other. In a 3 year, flexible dose, extension study, the incidence of all adverse events judged by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with AndroGel 1% and reported by > 1% of patients is shown in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Events Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related to Use of AndroGel 1% in the 3 Year, Flexible Dose, Extension Study Adverse Event Percent of Subjects (N = 162) +Lab test abnormal occurred in 15 patients with one or more of the following events reported: elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated testosterone, elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit, elevated cholesterol, elevated cholesterol/LDL ratio, elevated triglycerides, elevated HDL, elevated serum creatinine. *Urinary symptoms included nocturia, urinary hesitancy, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency and weak urinary stream. **Testis disorders included three patients.

Discontinuation for adverse events in this study included: two patients with application site reactions, one with kidney failure, and five with prostate disorders (including increase in serum PSA in 4 patients, and increase in PSA with prostate enlargement in a fifth patient). Increases in Serum PSA Observed in Clinical Trials of Hypogonadal Men During the initial 6-month study, the mean change in PSA values had a statistically significant increase of 0.26 ng/mL. Serum PSA was measured every 6 months thereafter in the 162 hypogonadal men on AndroGel 1% in the 3-year extension study. There was no additional statistically significant increase observed in mean PSA from 6 months through 36 months. However, there were increases in serum PSA observed in approximately 18% of individual patients. The overall mean change from baseline in serum PSA values for the entire group from month 6 to 36 was 0.11 ng/mL. Twenty-nine patients (18%) met the per-protocol criterion for increase in serum PSA, defined as >2X the baseline or any single serum PSA >6 ng/mL. Most of these (25/29) met this criterion by at least doubling of their PSA from baseline. In most cases where PSA at least doubled (22/25), the maximum serum PSA value was still <2 ng/mL. The first occurrence of a pre-specified, post-baseline increase in serum PSA was seen at or prior to Month 12 in most of the patients who met this criterion (23 of 29; 79%). Four patients met this criterion by having a serum PSA >6 ng/mL and in these, maximum serum PSA values were 6.2 ng/mL, 6.6 ng/mL, 6.7 ng/mL, and 10.7 ng/mL. In two of these patients, prostate cancer was detected on biopsy. The first patient's PSA levels were 4.7 ng/mL and 6.2 ng/mL at baseline and at Month 6/Final, respectively. The second patient's PSA levels were 4.2 ng/mL, 5.2 ng/mL, 5.8 ng/mL, and 6.6 ng/mL at baseline, Month 6, Month 12, and Final, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of AndroGel 1%. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4). Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions from Postmarketing Experience of AndroGel 1% by MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Elevated Hgb, Hct (polycythemia) Endocrine disorders: Hirsutism Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea General disorders and administration site reactions: Asthenia, edema, malaise Genitourinary disorders: Impaired urination Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests (e.g. transaminases, elevated GGTP, bilirubin) Investigations: Elevated PSA, electrolyte changes (nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium), changes in serum lipids (hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, decreased HDL), impaired glucose tolerance, fluctuating testosterone concentrations, weight increase Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (cysts and polyps): Prostate cancer Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, sleep apnea, insomnia Psychiatric disorders: Depression, emotional lability, decreased libido, nervousness, hostility, amnesia, anxiety Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, mastodynia, prostatic enlargement, testicular atrophy, oligospermia, priapism (frequent or prolonged erections) Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, alopecia, application site reaction (pruritus, dry skin, erythema, rash, discolored hair, paresthesia), sweating Vascular disorders: Hypertension, vasodilation (hot flushes) Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarket surveillance. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using AndroGel 1% [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, AndroGel 1% is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including AndroGel 1%, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.6 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. AndroGel 1% is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.7 Edema Androgens, including AndroGel 1%, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including AndroGel 1%, for hypogonadism. 5.9 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.10 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.11 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including AndroGel 1%, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.12 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including AndroGel 1%, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.13 Flammability Alcohol based products, including AndroGel 1%, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the AndroGel 1% has dried.",
