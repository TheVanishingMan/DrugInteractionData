"Drug Interactions Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone. The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin; therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before. A subnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy. Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity."$$
