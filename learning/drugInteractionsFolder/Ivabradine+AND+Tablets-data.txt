        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 inhibitors increase Corlanor plasma concentrations and CYP3A4 inducers decrease Corlanor plasma concentrations. (7.1) Negative chronotropes: Increased risk of bradycardia, monitor heart rate. (7.2) Pacemakers: Not recommended for use with demand pacemakers set to rates >= 60 beats per minute. (7.3) 7. 1 Cytochrome P450- Based Interaction s Corlanor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors increases ivabradine plasma concentrations, and use of CYP3A4 inducers decreases them. Increased plasma concentrations may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated [ s ee Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir), and nefazodone. Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors when using Corlanor. Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors include diltiazem, verapamil, and grapefruit juice [ s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers when using Corlanor. Examples of CYP3A4 inducers include St. John's wort, rifampicin, barbiturates, and phenytoin [ s ee Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7. 2 Negative C hronotropes Most patients receiving Corlanor will also be treated with a beta-blocker. The risk of bradycardia increases with concomitant administration of drugs that slow heart rate (e.g., digoxin, amiodarone, beta-blockers). Monitor heart rate in patients taking Corlanor with other negative chronotropes. 7.3 Pacemakers Corlanor dosing is based on heart rate reduction, targeting a heart rate of 50 to 60 beats per minute [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Patients with demand pacemakers set to a rate >= 60 beats per minute cannot achieve a target heart rate < 60 beats per minute, and these patients were excluded from clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The use of Corlanor is not recommended in patients with demand pacemakers set to rates >= 60 beats per minute."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include: Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions occurring in >= 1% of patients are bradycardia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and luminous phenomena (phosphenes). (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Medical Information at 1-800-772-6436 (1-800-77-AMGEN) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I f inhibitor ivabradine Trial (SHIFT), safety was evaluated in 3260 patients treated with Corlanor and 3278 patients given placebo. The median duration of Corlanor exposure was 21.5 months. The most common adverse drug reactions in the SHIFT trial are shown in Table 2 [see also Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) , ( 5.3 ) ]. Table 2. Adverse Drug Reactions with Rates >= 1.0% Higher on Ivabradine than Placebo occurring in > 1% on Ivabradine in SHIFT Ivabradine N=3260 Placebo N=3278 Bradycardia 10% 2.2% Hypertension, blood pressure increased 8.9% 7.8% Atrial fibrillation 8.3% 6.6% Phosphenes, visual brightness 2.8% 0.5% Luminous P henomena (Phosphenes) Phosphenes are phenomena described as a transiently enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field, halos, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), colored bright lights, or multiple images (retinal persistency). Phosphenes are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity. Corlanor can cause phosphenes, thought to be mediated through Corlanor's effects on retinal photoreceptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. Onset is generally within the first 2 months of treatment, after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity and led to treatment discontinuation in < 1% of patients; most resolved during or after treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Corlanor: syncope, hypotension, angioedema, erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, vertigo, diplopia, and visual impairment."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fetal toxicity: Females should use effective contraception. (5.1) Monitor patients for atrial fibrillation. (5.2) Monitor heart rate decreases and bradycardia symptoms during treatment. (5.3) Not recommended in patients with 2nd degree AV block. (5.3) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Corlanor may cause fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings in animal studies. Embryo-fetal toxicity and cardiac teratogenic effects were observed in fetuses of pregnant rats treated during organogenesis at exposures 1 to 3 times the human exposures (AUC0-24hr) at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females to use effective contraception when taking Corlanor [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. 5. 2 A trial F ibrillation Corlanor increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In SHIFT, the rate of atrial fibrillation was 5.0% per patient-year in patients treated with Corlanor and 3.9% per patient-year in patients treated with placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Regularly monitor cardiac rhythm. Discontinue Corlanor if atrial fibrillation develops. 5. 3 Bradycardia and C onduction D isturbances Bradycardia, sinus arrest, and heart block have occurred with Corlanor. The rate of bradycardia was 6.0% per patient-year in patients treated with Corlanor (2.7% symptomatic; 3.4% asymptomatic) and 1.3% per patient-year in patients treated with placebo. Risk factors for bradycardia include sinus node dysfunction, conduction defects (e.g., 1st or 2nd degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block), ventricular dyssynchrony, and use of other negative chronotropes (e.g., digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone). Concurrent use of verapamil or diltiazem will increase Corlanor exposure, may themselves contribute to heart rate lowering, and should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid use of Corlanor in patients with 2nd degree atrioventricular block, unless a functioning demand pacemaker is present [see Contraindications (4) and Dosage and Administration (2) ]."
