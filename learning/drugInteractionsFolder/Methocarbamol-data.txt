"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been reported coincident with the administration of methocarbamol. Some events may have been due to an overly rapid rate of intravenous injection. Body as a Whole: Anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, fever, headache Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, thrombophlebitis In most cases of syncope there was spontaneous recovery. In others, epinephrine, injectable steroids, and/or injectable antihistamines were employed to hasten recovery. Digestive System: Dyspepsia, jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice), nausea and vomiting Hemic and Lymphatic System: Leukopenia Immune System: Hypersensitivity reactions Nervous System: Amnesia, confusion, diplopia, dizziness or light-headedness, drowsiness, insomnia, mild muscular incoordination, nystagmus, sedation, seizures (including grand mal), vertigo The onset of convulsive seizures during intravenous administration of methocarbamol has been reported in patients with seizure disorders. The psychic trauma of the procedure may have been a contributing factor. Although several observers have reported success in terminating epileptiform seizures with methocarbamol injection, its administration to patients with epilepsy is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Skin and Special Senses: Blurred vision, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, metallic taste, pruritus, rash, urticaria Other: Pain and sloughing at the site of injection"$$
