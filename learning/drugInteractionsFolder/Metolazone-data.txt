"ADVERSE REACTIONS Metolazone is usually well tolerated and most reported adverse reactions have been mild and transient. Many metolazone related adverse reactions represent extensions of its expected pharmacologic activity and can be attributed to either its antihypertensive action or its renal/metabolic actions. The following adverse reactions have been reported. Several are single or comparably rare occurrences. Adverse reactions are listed in decreasing order of severity within body systems. Cardiovascular Chest pain/discomfort, orthostatic hypotension, excessive volume depletion, hemoconcentration, venous thrombosis, palpitations. Central and Peripheral Nervous System Syncope, neuropathy, vertigo, paresthesias, psychotic depression, impotence, dizziness/lightheadedness, drowsiness, fatigue, weakness, restlessness (sometimes resulting in insomnia), headache. Dermatologic/Hypersensitivity Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, necrotizing angiitis (cutaneous vasculitis), skin necrosis, purpura, petechiae, dermatitis (photosensitivity), urticaria, pruritus, skin rashes. Gastrointestinal Hepatitis, intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice, pancreatitis, vomiting, nausea, epigastric distress, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain. Hematologic Aplastic/hypoplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. Metabolic Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hypochloremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, increase in serum urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia. Musculoskeletal Joint pain, acute gouty attacks, muscle cramps or spasm. Other Transient blurred vision, chills, dry mouth. In addition, adverse reactions reported with similar antihypertensive-diuretics, but which have not been reported to date for metolazone include: bitter taste, sialadenitis, xanthopsia, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis) and anaphylactic reactions. These reactions should be considered as possible occurrences with clinical usage of metolazone. Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, metolazone dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn."$$

"Drug Interactions Diuretics Furosemide and probably other loop diuretics given concomitantly with metolazone can cause unusually large or prolonged losses of fluid and electrolytes (see WARNINGS). Other Antihypertensives When metolazone tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, care must be taken, especially during initial therapy. Dosage adjustments of other antihypertensives may be necessary. Alcohol, Barbiturates and Narcotics The hypotensive effects of these drugs may be potentiated by the volume contraction that may be associated with metolazone therapy. Digitalis Glycosides Diuretic-induced hypokalemia can increase the sensitivity of the myocardium to digitalis. Serious arrhythmias can result. Corticosteroids or ACTH May increase the risk of hypokalemia and increase salt and water retention. Lithium Serum lithium levels may increase (see WARNINGS). Curariform Drugs Diuretic-induced hypokalemia may enhance neuromuscular blocking effects of curariform drugs (such as tubocurarine) - the most serious effect would be respiratory depression which could proceed to apnea. Accordingly, it may be advisable to discontinue metolazone three days before elective surgery. Salicylates and Other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs May decrease the antihypertensive effects of metolazone tablets. Sympathomimetics Metolazone may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine, but this diminution is not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Agents See Glucose Tolerance under PRECAUTIONS, General. Methenamine Efficacy may be decreased due to urinary alkalizing effect of metolazone. Anticoagulants Metolazone, as well as other thiazide-like diuretics, may affect the hypoprothrombinemic response to anticoagulants; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None reported."$$
