"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1.New or Reactivated Viral Infections: Consider reducing immunosuppression. (5.6) 2.Blood Dyscrasias including Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA): Monitor for neutropenia or anemia; consider treatment interruption or dose reduction. (5.7) 3.Serious GI Tract Complications (gastrointestinal bleeding, perforations and ulcers): Administer with caution to patients with active digestive system disease. (5.8) 4.Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines. (5.9) 5.Patients with Hereditary Deficiency of Hypoxanthine-guanine Phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT): May cause exacerbation of disease symptoms; avoid use. (5.10) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Pregnancy Exposure Prevention and Planning Females of reproductive potential must be aware of the increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and congenital malformations and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. For recommended pregnancy testing and contraception methods [see Use in Specific Populations(8.6)]. 5.3 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning ]. 5.4 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. 5.5 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. 5.6 New or Reactivated Viral Infections Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including the mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended. 5.7 Blood Dyscrasias Including Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with MPA derivatives in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. The mechanism for MPA derivatives induced PRCA is unknown; the relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppressive regimen is also unknown. In some cases PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of therapy with MPA derivatives. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. Changes to mycophenolic acid therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimize the risk of graft rejection. Patients receiving mycophenolic acid should be monitored for blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia). The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolic acid itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these reactions. Complete blood count should be performed weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and the third month of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If blood dyscrasias occur [neutropenia develops (ANC <1.3\\303\\227103/mcL) or anemia], dosing with mycophenolic acid should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate tests performed, and the patient managed accordingly. 5.8 Serious GI Tract Complications Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization), intestinal perforations, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. 5.9 Immunizations The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets; examples include (but not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.10 Rare Hereditary Deficiencies Mycophenolic acid is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (IMPDH Inhibitor). Mycophenolic acid should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch- Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure."$$

The data described below derive from two randomized, comparative, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy trials in prevention of acute rejection in de novo and converted stable kidney transplant patients. In the de novo trial, patients were administered either mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 1.44 grams per day (N=213) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=210) within 48 hours post-transplant for 12 months in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids. Forty-one percent of patients also received antibody therapy as induction treatment. In the conversion trial, renal transplant patients who were at least 6 months post-transplant and receiving 2 grams per day MMF in combination with cyclosporine USP MODIFIED, with or without corticosteroids for at least two weeks prior to entry in the trial were randomized to mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 1.44 grams per day (N=159) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=163) for 12 months. The average age of patients in both studies was 47 years and 48 years (de novo study and conversion study, respectively), ranging from 22 to 75 years. Approximately 66% of patients were male; 82% were white, 12 % were black, and 6% other races. About 40% of patients were from the United States and 60% from other countries. In the de novo trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the mycophenolic acid arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0 to12 month study period was 59% and 60% in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%). The most common adverse reactions (>=20%) associated with the administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia and postoperative pain.

The data described below derive from two randomized, comparative, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy trials in prevention of acute rejection in de novo and converted stable kidney transplant patients. In the de novo trial, patients were administered either Myfortic 1.44 grams per day (N=213) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=210) within 48 hours post-transplant for 12 months in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids. Forty-one percent of patients also received antibody therapy as induction treatment. In the conversion trial, renal transplant patients who were at least 6 months post-transplant and receiving 2 grams per day MMF in combination with cyclosporine USP MODIFIED, with or without corticosteroids for at least two weeks prior to entry in the trial were randomized to Myfortic 1.44 grams per day (N=159) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=163) for 12 months. The average age of patients in both studies was 47 years and 48 years (de novo study and conversion study, respectively), ranging from 22 to 75 years. Approximately 66% of patients were male; 82% were white, 12% were black, and 6% other races. About 40% of patients were from the United States and 60% from other countries. In the de novo trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the Myfortic and MMF arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the Myfortic arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0 to 12 month study period was 59% and 60% in the Myfortic and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the Myfortic arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%). The most common adverse reactions (???20%) associated with the administration of Myfortic were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia, and postoperative pain. The adverse reactions reported in ???10% of patients in the de novo trial are presented in Table 2 below.

(7.3) 4.Sevelamer: May decrease MPA concentrations; concomitant use is not recommended. (7.4) 5.Cyclosporine: May decrease MPA concentrations; exercise caution when switching from cyclosporine to other drugs or from other drugs to cyclosporine. (7.5) 6.Norfloxacin and Metronidazole: May decrease MPA concentrations; concomitant use with both drugs is not recommended. (7.6) 7.Rifampin: May decrease MPA concentrations; concomitant use is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. (7.7) 8.Hormonal Contraceptives: Additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used. (5.2, 7.8) 9.Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, and other drugs that undergo renal tubular secretion: May increase concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and coadministered drug; monitor blood cell counts. (7.9) 7.1 Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Concomitant use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids decreased plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids not be administered simultaneously [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Azathioprine Given that azathioprine and MMF inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or MMF. 7.3 Cholestyramine, Bile Acid Sequestrates, Oral Activated Charcoal and Other Drugs that Interfere with Enterohepatic Recirculation Drugs that interrupt enterohepatic recirculation may decrease MPA plasma concentrations when coadministered with MMF. Therefore, do not administer mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, e.g., bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and therefore, MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are coadministered with cyclosporine. Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential change of MPA plasma concentrations after switching from cyclosporine to other immunosuppressive drugs or from other immunosuppressive drugs to cyclosporine in patients concomitantly receiving mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Norfloxacin and Metronidazole MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when MMF is administrated with norfloxacin and metronidazole. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. Although there will be no effect on MPA plasma concentrations when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole when given separately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Rifampin The concomitant administration of MMF and rifampin may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.8 Hormonal Contraceptives In a drug interaction study, mean levonorgestrel AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with MMF. Although mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives, it is recommended to coadminister mycophenolic acid delayed- release tablets with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.9 Acyclovir (Valacyclovir), Ganciclovir (Valganciclovir), and Other Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion The coadministration of MMF and acyclovir or ganciclovir may increase plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir as their coexistence competes for tubular secretion. Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment. Acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir may be taken with mycophenolic acid; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.10 Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid and Other Drugs that Alter the Gastrointestinal Flora Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora such as ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may interact with MMF by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet is concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet is needed when coadministered with these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.11 Pantoprazole Administration of a pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days to healthy volunteers did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$

(7.6) Rifampin: May decrease MPA concentrations; concomitant use is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk. (7.7) Hormonal Contraceptives: Additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used. (5.2, 7.8) Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, and Other Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion: May increase concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and coadministered drug; monitor blood cell counts. (7.9) 7.1 Antacids with Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides Concomitant use of Myfortic and antacids decreased plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is recommended that Myfortic and antacids not be administered simultaneously [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Azathioprine Given that azathioprine and MMF inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that Myfortic not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or MMF. 7.3 Cholestyramine, Bile Acid Sequestrates, Oral Activated Charcoal and Other Drugs that Interfere with Enterohepatic Recirculation Drugs that interrupt enterohepatic recirculation may decrease MPA plasma concentrations when coadministered with MMF. Therefore, do not administer Myfortic with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, e.g., bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfortic [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Sevelamer Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Sevelamer and other calcium free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with Myfortic [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and therefore, MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when Myfortic is coadministered with cyclosporine. Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential change of MPA plasma concentrations after switching from cyclosporine to other immunosuppressive drugs or from other immunosuppressive drugs to cyclosporine in patients concomitantly receiving Myfortic [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Norfloxacin and Metronidazole MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when MMF is administrated with norfloxacin and metronidazole. Therefore, Myfortic is not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. Although there will be no effect on MPA plasma concentrations when Myfortic is concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole when given separately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Rifampin The concomitant administration of MMF and rifampin may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Therefore, Myfortic is not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.8 Hormonal Contraceptives In a drug interaction study, mean levonorgestrel AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with MMF. Although Myfortic may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives, it is recommended to coadminister Myfortic with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant) with caution, and additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.9 Acyclovir (Valacyclovir), Ganciclovir (Valganciclovir), and Other Drugs that Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion The coadministration of MMF and acyclovir or ganciclovir may increase plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir as their coexistence competes for tubular secretion. Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment. Acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/ valganciclovir may be taken with Myfortic; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.10 Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic Acid and Other Drugs that Alter the Gastrointestinal Flora Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora such as ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may interact with MMF by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when Myfortic is concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of Myfortic is needed when coadministered with these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.11 Pantoprazole Administration of a pantoprazole at a dose of 40 mg twice daily for 4 days to healthy volunteers did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of Myfortic [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."$$
