        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

Cimetidine:A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect Nifedipine (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremors 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestsion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face And Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of nifedipine therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina pectoris (about 10% of the total patient population), dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Effect Nifedipine Extended-Release Tablets (%) (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release tablets patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS ) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect Nifedipine Capsules (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the co-administration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. 1 CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Nifedipine was administered orally to rats for two years and was not shown to be carcinogenic. When given to rats prior to mating, nifedipine caused reduced fertility at a dose approximately 30 times the maximum recommended human dose. There is a literature report of reversible reduction in the ability of human sperm obtained from a limited number of infertile men taking recommended doses of nifedipine to bind to and fertilize an ovum in vitro. In vivo mutagenicity studies were negative. 1 PREGNANCY Pregnancy Category C. In rodents, rabbits and monkeys, nifedipine has been shown to have a variety of embryotoxic, placentotoxic, teratogenic and fetotoxic effects, including stunted fetuses (rats, mice and rabbits), digital anomalies (rats and rabbits), rib deformities (mice), cleft palate (mice), small placentas and underdeveloped chorionic villi (monkeys), embryonic and fetal deaths (rats, mice and rabbits), prolonged pregnancy (rats; not evaluated in other species), and decreased neonatal survival (rats; not evaluated in other species). On a mg/kg or mg/m2 basis, some of the doses associated with these various effects are higher than the maximum recommended human dose and some are lower, but all are within an order of magnitude of it. The digital anomalies seen in nifedipine-exposed rabbit pups are strikingly similar to those seen in pups exposed to phenytoin, and these are in turn similar to the phalangeal deformities that are the most common malformation seen in human children with in utero exposure to phenytoin. From the clinical evidence available, a specific prenatal risk has not been identified. However, an increase in perinatal asphyxia, caesarean delivery, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation have been reported. Careful monitoring of blood pressure must be exercised in pregnant women, when administering nifedipine in combination with IV magnesium sulfate due to the possibility of an excessive fall in blood pressure which could harm the mother and fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3 NURSING MOTHERS Nifedipine is excreted in human milk. Nursing mothers are advised not to breastfeed their babies when taking the drug. 4 PEDIATRIC USE The safety and effectiveness of nifedipine extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 5 GERIATRIC USE Although small pharmacokinetic studies have identified an increased half-life and increased Cmax and AUC (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism), clinical studies of nifedipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Patients with Galactose Intolerance Since this medicinal product contains lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) PLACEBO (%) (n=370) (n=126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder, erectile dysfunction (ED) The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents: (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and since there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine: There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose United States and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face and Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of nifedipine therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences were not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina pectoris (about 10% of the total patient population), dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one-week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of the causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablet was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=707) PLACEBO (%) (n=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in patients given nifedipine extended-release tablets than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experiences) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine.

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) PLACEBO (%) (n=370) (n=126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine.2 Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication.

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (see WARNINGS). Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine:Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 20 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dosedoxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins:There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pretreatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day rifampin p.o. decreased the exposure to oral nifedipine (20mcg/kg) to 13%. The exposure to intravenous nifedipine by the same rifampin treatment was decreased to 70%. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is coadministered with rifampin. Rifapentine: Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when coadministered with rifapentine should be considered. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. When using nifedipine with phenytoin, the clinical response to nifedipine should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine as inducers of CYP3A can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or phenytoin is coadministered. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: Is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if St. John's Wort is coadministered. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related, and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily, and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache Flushing/heat sensation Dizziness Fatigue/asthenia Nausea Constipation 19 4 4 4 2 1 13 0 2 4 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor, and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one-week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of the causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablet was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=707) PLACEBO (%) (n=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in patients given nifedipine extended-release tablets than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experiences) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE Capsule (%) (n=226) PLACEBO (%) (n=235) Dizziness/lightheadedness giddiness 27 15 Flushing/heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral Edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion/sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS). In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine.

Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (see and .) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. INDICATIONS AND USAGE WARNINGS Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease (see WARNINGS ). Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS). In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: (see WARNINGS ) Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. Cardiovascular Drugs: Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the co-administration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 20 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day rifampin p.o. decreased the exposure to oral nifedipine (20 µg/kg) to 13 %. The exposure to intravenous nifedipine by the same rifampin treatment was decreased to 70%. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is co-administered with rifampin. Rifapentine: Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when co-administered with rifapentine should be considered. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored, and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. When using nifedipine with phenytoin, the clinical response to nifedipine should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine as inducers of CYP3A can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if phenobarbitone, carbamazepine, or phenytoin is co-administered. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus, the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: Is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if St. John's Wort is co-administered. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related, and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily, and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache Flushing/heat sensation Dizziness Fatigue/asthenia Nausea Constipation 19 4 4 4 2 1 13 0 2 4 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one-week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-Release Tablets (%) (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Adverse Effect Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release tablets patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS ) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect Nifedipine Capsules (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS ) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1,400 patients with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-Acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 13 patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over 200 patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy."

In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1,000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N = 707) (N = 266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release tablets patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia. Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1,000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine.

Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1,000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release capsules with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release capsules-treated patients.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1,400 patients with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-Acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 13 patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over 200 patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder, erectile dysfunction (ED). The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR(R)* with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine extended-release b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 Inhibitors, Alpha-Methyldopa Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore, nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic Acid Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital and Carbamazepine Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine extended-release administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multicenter placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine extended-release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. NIFEDIPINE IMMEDIATE-RELEASE CAPSULES (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of nifedipine therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS .) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine extended release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed.

If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Other Interactions Grapefruit Juice Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a doubling in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations most likely result from inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Avoid ingestion of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking nifedipine."

These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. NIFEDIPINE IMMEDIATE-RELEASE CAPSULES (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended release. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS .) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (SeeINDICATIONS AND USAGEandWARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg).

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents."

Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin.

Digitalis Digoxin: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day rifampin p.o. decreased the exposure to oral nifedipine (20 μg/kg) to 13%. The exposure to intravenous nifedipine by the same rifampin treatment was decreased to 70%. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is co-administered with rifampin. Rifapentine: Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when co-administered with rifapentine should be considered. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. When using nifedipine with phenytoin, the clinical response to nifedipine should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine as inducers of CYP3A can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or phenytoin is co-administered. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: Is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if St. John's Wort is co-administered. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Nifedipine was administered orally to rats for two years and was not shown to be carcinogenic. When given to rats prior to mating, nifedipine caused reduced fertility at a dose approximately 30 times the maximum recommended human dose. There is a literature report of reversible reduction in the ability of human sperm obtained from a limited number of infertile men taking recommended doses of nifedipine to bind to and fertilize an ovum in vitro. In vivo mutagenicity studies were negative."

However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day rifampin p.o. decreased the exposure to oral nifedipine (20 μg/kg) to 13%. The exposure to intravenous nifedipine by the same rifampin treatment was decreased to 70%. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is co-administered with rifampin. Rifapentine: Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when co-administered with rifapentine should be considered. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. When using nifedipine with phenytoin, the clinicalresponse to nifedipine should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine as inducers of CYP3A can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or phenytoin is co-administered. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: Is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if St. John's Wort is co-administered. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) PLACEBO (%) (n=370) (n=126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy."

The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine.

Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide : There has been too little experience with the co-administration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem : Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan : In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Adalat CC was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol : Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin : Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and Adalat CC, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing Adalat CC to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins : There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel : No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban : Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride : Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin / Dalfopristin : In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmaxand AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir , atanazavir , delavirine , fosamprinavir , indinavir , nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron : In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus : Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus : A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol : No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide : Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose : Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat : In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine : In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES The incidence of adverse events during treatment with Adalat CC in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on Adalat CC and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during Adalat CC therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder, erectile dysfunction (ED). The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS) Experience in over 1400 patients with PROCARDIA capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Other Interactions Grapefruit Juice Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a doubling in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations most likely result from inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Avoid ingestion of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking nifedipine."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with PROCARDIA XL was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Effect PROCARDIA XL (%) (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in PROCARDIA XL patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with PROCARDIA XL, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease (see WARNINGS). Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect PROCARDIA CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with PROCARDIA XL. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving PROCARDIA with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of PROCARDIA-treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS). In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine.2 Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release 60 mg and 29% on nifedipine extended-release 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine.2 Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ).

Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased C max and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding C max values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and C max of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and C max of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and C max of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pre-treatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The C max values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and C max for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced C max and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and C max of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for C max and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C max and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. T max and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and C max values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and C max by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and C max of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED- RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder, erectile dysfunction (ED). The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of Nifedipine capsules and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting nitrates Nifedipine capsules may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and since there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom Nifedipine capsule was administered. However, the relationship to Nifedipine capsules therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose United States and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of Nifedipine capsules. Adverse Effect Nifedipine capsules (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face and Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of Nifedipine capsules therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving Nifedipine capsules with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences were not different from that of the entire group of Nifedipine capsules treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina pectoris (about 10% of the total patient population), dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1,400 patients with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-Acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 13 patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over 200 patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1,000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N = 707) (N = 266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release tablets patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia. Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1,000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine Immediate-release Capsules (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N = 226) (N = 235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2,100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1,000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release capsules with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release capsules-treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in 1 in 8 patients. Hypotension occurred in about 1 in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately 1 patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about 1 patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about 1 patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS). Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Other Interactions Grapefruit Juice Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations are most likely due to inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice is to be avoided."

Avoid coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

Other Interactions: Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a doubling in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations most likely result from inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Avoid ingestion of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking nifedipine."

In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the co-administration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 20 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 600 mg/day rifampin p.o. decreased the exposure to oral nifedipine (20 μg/kg) to 13%. The exposure to intravenous nifedipine by the same rifampin treatment was decreased to 70%. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if nifedipine is co-administered with rifampin. Rifapentine: Rifapentine, as an inducer of CYP3A4, can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. A dose adjustment of nifedipine when co-administered with rifapentine should be considered. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. When using nifedipine with phenytoin, the clinical response to nifedipine should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Phenobarbitone and carbamazepine as inducers of CYP3A can decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if phenobarbitone, carbamazepine or phenytoin is co-administered. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: Is an inducer of CYP3A4 and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Dose adjustment of nifedipine may be necessary if St. John's Wort is co-administered. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication.

        "Drug Interactions: Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased C max and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding C max values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine.

Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and C max of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and C max of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and C max of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The C max values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. 2 Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and C max for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced C max and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and C max of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for C max and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C max and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. T max and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and C max values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and C max by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and C max of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release 30 mg daily and 22% on nifedipine extended-release 60 mg and 29% on nifedipine extended-release 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.

In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents."

Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministraion of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pretreatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored, and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus, the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 × 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related, and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily, and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents: (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and since there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine: There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid coadministration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy. CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose United States and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face and Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of nifedipine therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences were not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina pectoris (about 10% of the total patient population), dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended release was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED RELEASE TABLETS (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended release patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with nifedipine extended release tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. NIFEDIPINE IMMEDIATE-RELEASE CAPSULES (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitations 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended release. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS .) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Other Interactions Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately a doubling in nifedipine AUC and Cmax with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations most likely result from inhibition of CYP 3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Avoid ingestion of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking nifedipine."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1,400 patients with nifedipine immediate-release capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministraion of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pretreatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine bycimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentration of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored, and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus, the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministered of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 × 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related, and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily, and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Adverse Event NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) (n=370) PLACEBO (%) (n=126) Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder, erectile dysfunction (ED). The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor, and urticaria."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of PROCARDIA and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting nitrates PROCARDIA may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and since there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom PROCARDIA was administered. However, the relationship to PROCARDIA therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In multiple-dose United States and foreign controlled studies in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of PROCARDIA. PROCARDIA (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face and Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of PROCARDIA therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving PROCARDIA with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences were not different from that of the entire group of PROCARDIA (nifedipine) treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina pectoris (about 10% of the total patient population), dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache, or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the co-administration of Tambocor with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when co-administering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after co-administration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-blockers Nifedipine extended-release was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are co-administered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg Nifedipine Extended-Release Tablets b.i.d. Co-administration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is co-administered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release to avoid possible over- or under- digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was co-administered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Co-administration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride: Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron: In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus: Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus: A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg Nifedipine Extended-Release Tablets administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol: No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide: Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose: Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat: In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine: In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release 60 mg daily and 29% on nifedipine extended-release 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE (%) PLACEBO (%) (n=370) (n=126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: NIFEDIPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) Placebo (%) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. NIFEDIPINE IMMEDIATE-RELEASE CAPSULES (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=226) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine immediate-release with concomitant beta blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine immediate-release treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions."

        "Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents: (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates: Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and since there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Quinidine: There have been rare reports of an interaction between quinidine and nifedipine (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine). Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine: A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised. Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy."

Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The most common adverse events were: Incidence Approximately 10% Cardiovascular: peripheral edema Central Nervous System: dizziness or lightheadedness Gastrointestinal: nausea Systemic: headache and flushing, weakness Incidence Approximately 5% Cardiovascular: transient hypotension Incidence 2% or Less Cardiovascular: palpitation Respiratory: nasal and chest congestion, shortness of breath Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, constipation, cramps, flatulence Musculoskeletal: inflammation, joint stiffness, muscle cramps Central Nervous System: shakiness, nervousness, jitteriness, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, difficulties in balance Other: dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, fever, sweating, chills, sexual difficulties Incidence Approximately 0.5% Cardiovascular: syncope (mostly with initial dosing and/or an increase in dose), erythromelalgia Incidence Less Than 0.5% Hematologic: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, purpura Gastrointestinal: allergic hepatitis Face and Throat: angioedema (mostly oropharyngeal edema with breathing difficulty in a few patients), gingival hyperplasia CNS: depression, paranoid syndrome Special Senses: transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tinnitus Urogenital: nocturia, polyuria Other: arthritis with ANA (+), exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia Musculoskeletal: myalgia Several of these side effects appear to be dose related. Peripheral edema occurred in about one in 25 patients at doses less than 60 mg per day and in about one patient in eight at 120 mg per day or more. Transient hypotension, generally of mild to moderate severity and seldom requiring discontinuation of therapy, occurred in one of 50 patients at less than 60 mg per day and in one of 20 patients at 120 mg per day or more. Very rarely, introduction of nifedipine therapy was associated with an increase in anginal pain, possibly due to associated hypotension. Transient unilateral loss of vision has also occurred. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%.

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during PROCARDIA XL Extended Release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with PROCARDIA XL was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg).

Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with PROCARDIA XL, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS.) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment.

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, grapefruit, nefazodone, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide There has been too little experience with the coadministration of TAMBOCOR(R) The following is a registered trademark of its manufacturer: TAMBOCOR(R)/Graceway Pharmaceuticals. with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem Pre-treatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablets were well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine extended-release b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine, and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablets, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablets to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidrogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 Inhibitors, Alpha-Methyldopa Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin/Dalfopristin In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore, nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic Acid Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital and Carbamazepine Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine extended-release administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine extended-release increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease the exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events during treatment with nifedipine extended-release tablets in doses up to 90 mg daily were derived from multicenter placebo-controlled clinical trials in 370 hypertensive patients. Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extended-release tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 30 mg daily, 22% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 60 mg daily and 29% on nifedipine extended-release tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) (n = 370) Placebo (%) (n = 126) Adverse Event Headache 19 13 Flushing/heat sensation 4 0 Dizziness 4 2 Fatigue/asthenia 4 4 Nausea 2 1 Constipation 1 0 Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar, causal relationship cannot be established. The following adverse events were reported with an incidence of 3% or less in daily doses up to 90 mg: Body as a Whole/Systemic: chest pain, leg pain Central Nervous System: paresthesia, vertigo Dermatologic: rash Gastrointestinal: constipation Musculoskeletal: leg cramps Respiratory: epistaxis, rhinitis Urogenital: impotence, urinary frequency Other adverse events reported with an incidence of less than 1% were: Body as a Whole/Systemic: allergic reaction, asthenia, cellulitis, substernal chest pain, chills, facial edema, lab test abnormal, malaise, neck pain, pelvic pain, pain, photosensitivity reaction Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, extrasystole, hypotension, migraine, palpitations, phlebitis, postural hypotension, tachycardia, cutaneous angiectases Central Nervous System: anxiety, confusion, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, somnolence Dermatologic: angioedema, petechial rash, pruritus, sweating Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, eructation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, GGT increased, gum disorder, gum hemorrhage, vomiting Hematologic: eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy Metabolic: gout, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, joint disorder, myalgia, myasthenia Respiratory: dyspnea, increased cough, rales, pharyngitis, stridor Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, breast engorgement, polyuria, urogenital disorder The following adverse events have been reported rarely in patients given nifedipine in coat core or other formulations: allergenic hepatitis, alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, anemia, arthritis with ANA (+), depression, erythromelalgia, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, gingival hyperplasia, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, jaundice, leukopenia, mood changes, muscle cramps, nervousness, paranoid syndrome, purpura, shakiness, sleep disturbances, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, taste perversion, thrombocytopenia, toxic epidermal necrolysis, transient blindness at the peak of plasma level, tremor and urticaria."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) Adverse Effect (N=707) (N=266) Headache 15.8 9.8 Fatigue 5.9 4.1 Dizziness 4.1 4.5 Constipation 3.3 2.3 Nausea 3.3 1.9 Of these, only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps, the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia, flushing, pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus, rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific), dyspnea Urogenital: impotence, polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema, fever, hot flashes, malaise, periorbital edema, rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, hypotension, increased angina, tachycardia, syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety, ataxia, decreased libido, depression, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paroniria, tremor, vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia, increased sweating, urticaria, purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation, gastroesophageal reflux, gum hyperplasia, melena, vomiting, weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain, gout, myalgias Respiratory: coughing, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory disorder, sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain, dysuria, hematuria, nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences, reported in less than 1% of patients, occurred under conditions (e.g., open trials, marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery, including the need for bezoar removal, has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended - release Tablets, even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS .) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously, adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. Adverse Effect NIFEDIPINE CAPSULES (%) (N=226) Placebo (%) (N=235) Dizziness, lightheadedness, giddiness 27 15 Flushing, heat sensation 25 8 Headache 23 20 Weakness 12 10 Nausea, heartburn 11 8 Muscle cramps, tremor 8 3 Peripheral edema 7 1 Nervousness, mood changes 7 4 Palpitation 7 5 Dyspnea, cough, wheezing 6 3 Nasal congestion, sore throat 6 8 There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris, and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition, more serious adverse events were observed, not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible, however, that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta-blocker therapy, the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS.) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina, dizziness or lightheadedness, peripheral edema, headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis also has been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in a noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates Nifedipine may be safely coadministered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination. Digitalis Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Coumarin Anticoagulants There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Cimetidine A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after a one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised."

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. and data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. In vitro in vivo CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A . Coadministraion of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased C and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Quinidine: in vitro max There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Flecainide: Calcium Channel Blockers Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding C values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Diltiazem: max Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Verapamil: ACE Inhibitors In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Benazepril: Angiotensin-II Blockers studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Irbesartan: In vitro No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Candesartan: Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Timolol: Central Alpha1-Blockers Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and C of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and C of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Doxazosin: max max Digitalis The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Digoxin: Antithrombotics There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Coumarins: Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Clopidogrel: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Tirofiban: Other Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents. Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and C of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pretreatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or coadministration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Omeprazole: max In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Pantoprazole: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Coadministration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of coadministered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The C values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine bycimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored, and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cimetidine: max Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentration of nifedipine. Cisapride: Antibacterial Drugs drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and C for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon coadministration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: In vitro max Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Antitubercular Drugs Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See ). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced C and AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Rifampin: CONTRAINDICATIONS max Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir, atanazavir, delavirine, fosamprinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs , a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Nefazodone a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored, and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Coadministration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and C of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: max Antiemetic Drugs In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Dolasetron: Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus . Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is coadministered with tacrolimus, the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Tacrolimus: in vitro A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Sirolimus: Glucose Lowering Drugs Coadministration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73 to 0.95) for C and 0.88 (0.80 to 0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Pioglitazone: max Coadministration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Rosiglitazone: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. T and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin: max max No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Miglitol: Coadministration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and C values for both drugs. Repaglinide: max Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is coadministered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Acarbose: Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Orlistat: Dietary Supplements In healthy volunteers, a single dose coadministered of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and C by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 × 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and C of nifedipine by a factor of 2.0. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Grapefruit Juice: max max Herbals St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. St. John's Wort: CYP2D6 Probe Drug In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Debrisoquine: in vivo"

        "Drug Interactions Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions. CYP3A Inhibitors CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications. Strong CYP3A Inducers Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular Drugs Antiarrhythmics Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministraion of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine. Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use. Calcium Channel Blockers Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered. Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. ACE Inhibitors Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril. Angiotensin-II Blockers Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected. Beta-Blockers Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered. Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol. Central Alpha1-Blockers Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Digitalis Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentration of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. Antithrombotics Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine. Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly. Other Diuretics, PDE5 inhibitors, alpha-methyldopa: Nifedipine may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of these concomitantly administered agents."

Non-Cardiovascular Drugs Antifungal Drugs Ketoconazole, itraconazole and fluconazole are CYP3A inhibitors and can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Antisecretory Drugs Omeprazole: In healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine after pretreatment with omeprazole 20 mg q.d. for 8 days were 1.26 and 0.87 times those after pre-treatment with placebo. Pretreatment with or co-administration of omeprazole did not impact the effect of nifedipine on blood pressure or heart rate. The impact of omeprazole on nifedipine is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Pantoprazole: In healthy volunteers the exposure to neither drug was changed significantly in the presence of the other drug. Ranitidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple ranitidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered ranitidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. Co-administration of ranitidine did not have relevant effects on the exposure to nifedipine that affected the blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive or hypertensive subjects. Cimetidine: Five studies in healthy volunteers investigated the impact of multiple cimetidine doses on the single or multiple dose pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Two studies investigated the impact of co-administered cimetidine on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects on nifedipine. In normotensive subjects receiving single doses of 10 mg or multiple doses of up to 20 mg nifedipine t.i.d. alone or together with cimetidine up to 1000 mg/day, the AUC values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were between 1.52 and 2.01 times those in the absence of cimetidine. The Cmax values of nifedipine in the presence of cimetidine were increased by factors ranging between 1.60 and 2.02. The increase in exposure to nifedipine by cimetidine was accompanied by relevant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects receiving 10 mg q.d. nifedipine alone or in combination with cimetidine 1000 mg q.d. also experienced relevant changes in blood pressure when cimetidine was added to nifedipine. The interaction between cimetidine and nifedipine is of clinical relevance and blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Cisapride : Simultaneous administration of cisapride and nifedipine may lead to increased plasma concentrations of nifedipine. Antibacterial Drugs Quinupristin / Dalfopristin : In vitro drug interaction studies have demonstrated that quinupristin/dalfopristin significantly inhibits the CYP3A metabolism of nifedipine. Concomitant administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin and nifedipine (repeated oral dose) in healthy volunteers increased AUC and Cmax for nifedipine by factors of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively, compared to nifedipine monotherapy. Upon co-administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin with nifedipine, blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Erythromycin: Erythromycin, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Antitubercular Drugs Rifampin: Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifapentin, and rifabutin reduce the bioavailability of nifedipine which may reduce the efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (See CONTRAINDICATIONS). The impact of multiple oral doses of 600 mg rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine after a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was evaluated in a clinical study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule on study Day 1. Starting on study Day 2, the subjects received 600 mg rifampin once daily for 14 days. On study Day 15, a second single oral dose of 20 mg nifedipine capsule was administered together with the last dose of rifampin. Compared to study Day 1, 14 days pretreatment with rifampin reduced Cmaxand AUC of concomitantly administered nifedipine on average by 95% and 97%, respectively. Antiviral Drugs Amprenavir , atanazavir , delavirine , fosamprinavir , indinavir , nelfinavir and ritonavir, as CYP3A inhibitors, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients recommended. CNS Drugs Nefazodone, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Fluoxetine, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered. Valproic acid may increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and a dose reduction of nifedipine considered. Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, and Carbamazepine: Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of nifedipine 10 mg capsule and 60 mg nifedipine coat-core tablet with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A, lowered the AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by approximately 70%. Phenobarbital and carbamazepine are also inducers of CYP3A. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients taking phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Antiemetic Drugs Dolasetron : In patients taking dolasetron by the oral or intravenous route and nifedipine, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Immunosuppressive Drugs Tacrolimus : Tacrolimus has been shown to be metabolized via the CYP3A system. Nifedipine has been shown to inhibit the metabolism of tacrolimus in vitro. Transplant patients on tacrolimus and nifedipine required from 26% to 38% smaller doses than patients not receiving nifedipine. Nifedipine can increase the exposure to tacrolimus. When nifedipine is co-administered with tacrolimus the blood concentrations of tacrolimus should be monitored and a reduction of the dose of tacrolimus considered. Sirolimus : A single 60 mg dose of nifedipine and a single 10 mg dose of sirolimus oral solution were administered to 24 healthy volunteers. Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions were not observed. Glucose Lowering Drugs Pioglitazone: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with 30 mg nifedipine ER administered orally q.d. for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for AUC relative to nifedipine monotherapy. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rosiglitazone: Co-administration of rosiglitazone (4 mg b.i.d.) was shown to have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Metformin: A single dose metformin-nifedipine interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount of metformin excreted in urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Miglitol : No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine. Repaglinide : Co-administration of 10 mg nifedipine with a single dose of 2 mg repaglinide (after 4 days nifedipine 10 mg t.i.d. and repaglinide 2 mg t.i.d.) resulted in unchanged AUC and Cmax values for both drugs. Acarbose : Nifedipine tends to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glucose control. If nifedipine is co-administered with acarbose, blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully and a dose adjustment of nifedipine considered. Drugs Interfering with Food Absorption Orlistat : In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 120 mg t.i.d. for 6 days, orlistat did not alter the bioavailability of 60 mg nifedipine (extended release tablets). Dietary Supplements Grapefruit Juice: In healthy volunteers, a single dose co-administration of 250 mL double strength grapefruit juice with 10 mg nifedipine increased AUC and Cmax by factors of 1.35 and 1.13, respectively. Ingestion of repeated doses of grapefruit juice (5 x 200 mL in 12 hours) after administration of 20 mg nifedipine ER increased AUC and Cmax of nifedipine by a factor of 2. Grapefruit juice should be avoided by patients on nifedipine. The intake of grapefruit juice should be stopped at least 3 days prior to initiating patients on nifedipine. Herbals St. John's Wort: St. John's Wort is an inducer of CYP3A and may decrease exposure to nifedipine. Alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in patients in whom St. John's Wort therapy is necessary. CYP2D6 Probe Drug Debrisoquine : In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with nifedipine 20 mg t.i.d. for 5 days did not change the metabolic ratio of hydroxydebrisoquine to debrisoquine measured in urine after a single dose of 10 mg debrisoquine. Thus, it is improbable that nifedipine inhibits in vivo the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6."
