"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroids, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Discontinue if pain or inflammation in a tendon occurs. (5.1, 8.5) Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported. Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, hypokalemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3, 7.4, 8.5). Use caution in patients with proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia. (5.3) Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. (5.4, 5.5) Central nervous system (CNS) events including dizziness, confusion, hallucination, depression, and rarely suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose. Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. (5.6) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.7) Peripheral neuropathy: Discontinue if symptoms occur. (5.8) 5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).] 5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid AVELOX in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.3 QT Prolongation AVELOX has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of AVELOX the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). The drug should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia and patients receiving Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations. Pharmacokinetic studies between AVELOX and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed. An additive effect of AVELOX and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore caution should be exercised when AVELOX is given concurrently with these drugs. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse events was similar in 798 AVELOX and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia, acute myocardial ischemia. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with AVELOX treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 AVELOX tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. Elderly patients using IV AVELOX may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)]. In addition, AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including AVELOX . Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. AVELOX should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, may be administered as indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including AVELOX . These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness Allergic pneumonitis Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.4). 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, may cause central nervous system (CNS) events, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4)]. Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, rarely, suicidal thoughts or acts. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving AVELOX , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold [see Drug Interactions (7.4) Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.7 Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AVELOX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy Rare cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals The oral administration of AVELOX caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species [see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]. 5.10 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolone antibiotics after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. 5.11 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AVELOX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]."$$

(5.8) 5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) and Patient Counseling Information (17) .] 5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid moxifloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.3 QT Prolongation Moxifloxacin has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). The drug should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia and patients receiving Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations. Pharmacokinetic studies between moxifloxacin and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed. An additive effect of moxifloxacin and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore caution should be exercised when moxifloxacin is given concurrently with these drugs. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse events was similar in 798 moxifloxacin and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia, acute myocardial ischemia. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. In addition, moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17) .] 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including moxifloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, may be administered as indicated. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including moxifloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness Allergic pneumonitis Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) and Adverse Reactions( 6.4 )]. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, may cause central nervous system (CNS) events, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia. [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2, 6.4 ).] Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, rarely, suicidal thoughts or acts. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 , 6.4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ).] 5.7 Clostridium Difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including moxifloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin and may be irreversible. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals The oral administration of moxifloxacin caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. [see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2 ).] 5.10 Blood Gluocose Disturbances As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin. In moxifloxacin-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, moxifloxacin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) Patient Counseling Information (17) .] 5.11 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolone antibiotics after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) and Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 ).] 5.12 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing moxifloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture.

Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3, 7.5, 8.5) -Hypersensitivity and other serious reactions: Serious and sometimes fatal reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. (5.4, 5.5) -Central nervous system (CNS) events including dizziness, confusion, hallucination, depression, and suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose. Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. (5.6) - Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.75.7) -Peripheral neuropathy: Discontinue if symptoms occur in order to prevent irreversibility. (5.8) 5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. 5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid AVELOX in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. 5.3 QT Prolongation AVELOX has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of AVELOX the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). Avoid AVELOX in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations: -Known prolongation of the QT interval -Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions -Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia, -Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia -Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents -Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Elderly patients using intravenous AVELOX may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)] In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with AVELOX. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 AVELOX and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with AVELOX treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 AVELOX tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including AVELOX. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Discontinue AVELOX at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] 5.5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX. These reactions may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: -Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) -Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness -Allergic pneumonitis -Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure -Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure -Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities Discontinue AVELOX immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, may cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia. Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX. AVELOX may also cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, suicidal thoughts or acts. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving AVELOX, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, use AVELOX when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. [See Drug Interactions (7.4)] 5.7 Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AVELOX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including AVELOX. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of AVELOX and may be irreversible. AVELOX should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. 5.9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals In immature dogs, oral administration of AVELOX caused lameness. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2).] 5.10 Blood Glucose Disturbances As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with AVELOX. In AVELOX-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, AVELOX should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately. [See Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ).] 5.11 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. AVELOX should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2).] 5.12 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AVELOX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."$$

Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. 5.2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. 5.3 QT Prolongation Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations: Known prolongation of the QT interval Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia, Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Elderly patients using intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)] In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] 5.5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. These reactions may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness Allergic pneumonitis Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, may cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia. Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride may also cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, suicidal thoughts or acts. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin hydrochloride, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, use moxifloxacin hydrochloride when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. [See Drug Interactions (7.4)] 5.7 Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may be irreversible. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. 5.9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals In immature dogs, oral administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride caused lameness. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2).] 5.10 Blood Glucose Disturbances As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin hydrochloride. In moxifloxacin hydrochloride-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately. [See Drug Interactions (7.3).] 5.11 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2).] 5.12 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."$$
"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported. Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3, 7.5, 8.5) Hypersensitivity and other serious reactions: Serious and sometimes fatal reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. (5.4, 5.5) Central nervous system (CNS) events including dizziness, confusion, hallucination, depression, and suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose. Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. (5.6) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.7) Peripheral neuropathy: Discontinue if symptoms occur in order to prevent irreversibility. (5.8) 5.1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported.

Pharmacokinetic studies between moxifloxacin and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed. An additive effect of moxifloxacin and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore caution should be exercised when moxifloxacin is given concurrently with these drugs.

Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Moxifloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical ophthalmic use only. (5.1) Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have been reported with systemic use of moxifloxacin. (5.2) Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. (5.3) Patients should not wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. (5.4) 5.1 Topical Ophthalmic Use Only NOT FOR INJECTION. MOXEZA(R) solution is for topical ophthalmic use only and should not be injected subconjunctivally or introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions In patients receiving systemically administered quinolones, including moxifloxacin, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported, some following the first dose. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. If an allergic reaction to moxifloxacin occurs, discontinue use of the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment.

"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Topical ophthalmic use only. (5.1) Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have been reported with systemic use of moxifloxacin. (5.2) Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. (5.3) Patients should not wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. (5.4) 5.1 Topical Ophthalmic Use Only NOT FOR INJECTION. VIGAMOX(R) solution is for topical ophthalmic use only and should not be injected subconjunctivally or introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reaction In patients receiving systemically administered quinolones, including moxifloxacin, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported, some following the first dose. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. If an allergic reaction to moxifloxacin occurs, discontinue use of the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management should be administered as clinically indicated. 5.3 Growth of Resistant Organisms with Prolonged Use As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.4 Avoidance of Contact Lens Wear Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis."$$

The data described below reflect exposure to moxifloxacin hydrochloride in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II to IV clinical trials in different indications [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (>0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia.

The data described below reflect exposure to moxifloxacin in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II to IV clinical trials in different indications [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was <65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily PO, IV, or sequentially (IV followed by PO). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin due to adverse events occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4.1% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 3.9% with 400 mg IV and 8.2% with sequential therapy 400 mg PO/IV. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg PO doses were nausea (0.8%), diarrhea (0.5%), dizziness (0.5%), and vomiting (0.4%). The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg IV dose was rash (0.5%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg IV/PO sequential dose were diarrhea (0.5%), pyrexia (0.4%).

The data described below reflect exposure to Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II-IV clinical trials in different indications [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Discontinuation of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (>0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to 1% of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride-treated patients, are shown in Tables 2 and Table 3, respectively.

The data described below reflect exposure to moxifloxacin in 14,981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II to IV clinical trials in different indications [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (> 0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of moxifloxacin-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to 1% of moxifloxacin-treated patients, are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (3%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness. Table 2.

The most frequently reported ocular adverse events were conjunctivitis, decreased visual acuity, dry eye, keratitis, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and tearing. These events occurred in approximately 1-6% of patients. Nonocular adverse events reported at a rate of 1-4% were fever, increased cough, infection, otitis media, pharyngitis, rash, and rhinitis."$$
"ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical efficacy trials enrolled over 9,200 moxifloxacin orally and intravenously treated patients, of whom over 8,600 patients received the 400 mg dose. Most adverse events reported in moxifloxacin trials were described as mild to moderate in severity and required no treatment. Moxifloxacin was discontinued due to adverse reactions thought to be drug-related in 2.9% of orally treated patients and 6.3 % of sequentially (intravenous followed by oral) treated patients. The latter studies were conducted in community acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections with, in general, a sicker patient population compared to the tablet studies. Adverse reactions, judged by investigators to be at least possibly drug-related, occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of moxifloxacin treated patients were: nausea (6%), diarrhea (5%), dizziness (2%). Additional clinically relevant uncommon events, judged by investigators to be at least possibly drug-related, that occurred in greater than or equal to 0.1% and less than 2% of moxifloxacin treated patients were: BODY AS A WHOLE: abdominal pain, headache, asthenia, dehydration (secondary to diarrhea or reduced fluid intake), injection site reaction (including phlebitis), malaise, moniliasis, pain, allergic reaction CARDIOVASCULAR: cardiac arrhythmia (not otherwise specified), tachycardia, palpitation, vasodilation, QT interval prolonged DIGESTIVE: vomiting, abnormal liver function test (increased transaminases, increased bilirubin), dyspepsia, dry mouth, flatulence, oral moniliasis, constipation, GGTP increased, anorexia, stomatitis, glossitis HEMIC AND LYMPHATIC: leukopenia, eosinophilia, prothrombin decrease (prothrombin time prolonged/International Normalized Ratio (INR) increased), thrombocythemia METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL: lactic dehydrogenase increased, amylase increased MUSCULOSKELETAL: arthralgia, myalgia NERVOUS SYSTEM: insomnia, nervousness, vertigo, somnolence, anxiety, tremor SKIN/APPENDAGES: rash (maculopapular, purpuric, pustular), pruritus, sweating, urticaria SPECIAL SENSES: taste perversion UROGENITAL: vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis Additional clinically relevant rare events, judged by investigators to be at least possibly drug-related, that occurred in less than 0.1% of moxifloxacin treated patients were: abnormal dreams, abnormal vision (visual disturbances temporally associated with CNS symptoms), agitation, amblyopia, amnesia, anemia, aphasia, arthritis, asthma, atrial fibrillation, back pain, chest pain, confusion, convulsions of various clinical manifestations (including grand mal convulsions), depersonalization, depression (potentially culminating in self-endangering behavior), dysphagia, dyspnea, ECG abnormal, emotional lability, face edema, gastritis, gastrointestinal disorder, hallucinations, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hypertonia, hyperuricemia, hypesthesia, hypotension, incoordination, jaundice (predominantly cholestatic), kidney function abnormal, lab test abnormal (not specified), leg pain, paraesthesia, parosmia, pelvic pain, peripheral edema, photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, pseudomembranous colitis, prothrombin increase (prothrombin time decreased/International Normalized Ratio (INR) decreased), sleep disorders, speech disorders, supraventricular tachycardia, syncope, taste loss, tendon disorder, thinking abnormal, thrombocytopenia, thromboplastin decrease, tinnitus, tongue discoloration, ventricular tachycardia Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports:Additional adverse events have been reported from worldwide post-marketing experience with moxifloxacin. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events, some of them life-threatening, include anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, angioedema (including laryngeal edema), hepatic failure, including fatal cases, hepatitis (predominantly cholestatic), photosensitivity/phototoxicity reaction (see PRECAUTIONS), psychotic reaction (very rarely culminating in self-endangering behavior), renal dysfunction or renal failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, tendon rupture, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including in very rare cases cardiac arrest and torsade de pointes, and usually in patients with concurrent severe underlying proarrhythmic conditions). Cases of altered coordination and abnormal gait as well as exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the warnings and precautions section of the label: -Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] -Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -QT Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] -Central Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] -Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] -Peripheral Neuropathy that may be irreversible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] -Blood Glucose Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] -Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] -Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II-IV clinical trials in different indications [see Indications and Usage (1)]. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Discontinuation of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO, 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (>0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to 1% of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride-treated patients, are shown in Tables 2 and Table 3, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (3%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.

It cannot be determined if any of the above laboratory abnormalities were caused by the drug or the underlying condition being treated. Table 4 below lists adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

"ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported ocular adverse events were conjunctivitis, decreased visual acuity, dry eye, keratitis, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and tearing. These events occurred in approximately 1-6% of patients. Nonocular adverse events reported at a rate of 1-4% were fever, increased cough, infection, otitis media, pharyngitis, rash, and rhinitis."$$
"Drug Interactions: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins: Quinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Oral administration of quinolones with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as VIDEX(R) (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, moxifloxacin should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these agents. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) No clinically significant drug-drug interactions between itraconazole, theophylline, warfarin, digoxin, atenolol, oral contraceptives or glyburide have been observed with moxifloxacin. Itraconazole, theophylline, digoxin, probenecid, morphine, ranitidine, and calcium have been shown not to significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) Warfarin: No significant effect of moxifloxacin on R- and S-warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving 24 healthy volunteers. No significant changes in prothrombin time were noted in the presence of moxifloxacin. Quinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population. In addition, infectious disease and its accompanying inflammatory process, age, and general status of the patient are risk factors for increased anticoagulant activity. Therefore the prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if a quinolone is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives. Drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes: In vitro studies with cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes (e.g. midazolam, cyclosporine, warfarin, theophylline). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions. (See WARNINGS.) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of moxifloxacin have not been performed. Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in 4 bacterial strains (TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537) used in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay. As with other quinolones, the positive response observed with moxifloxacin in strain TA 102 using the same assay may be due to the inhibition of DNA gyrase. Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in the CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell gene mutation assay. An equivocal result was obtained in the same assay when v79 cells were used. Moxifloxacin was clastogenic in the v79 chromosome aberration assay, but it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. There was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in a micronucleus test or a dominant lethal test in mice. Moxifloxacin had no effect on fertility in male and female rats at oral doses as high as 500 mg/kg/day, approximately 12 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m2), or at intravenous doses as high as 45 mg/kg/day, approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m2). At 500 mg/kg orally there were slight effects on sperm morphology (head-tail separation) in male rats and on the estrous cycle in female rats. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C:Moxifloxacin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at oral doses as high as 500 mg/kg/day or 0.24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on systemic exposure (AUC), but decreased fetal body weights and slightly delayed fetal skeletal development (indicative of fetotoxicity) were observed. Intravenous administration of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m2)) to pregnant rats resulted in maternal toxicity and a marginal effect on fetal and placental weights and the appearance of the placenta. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at intravenous doses as high as 80 mg/kg/day. Intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based upon systemic exposure) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and delayed fetal skeletal ossification. When rib and vertebral malformations were combined, there was an increased fetal and litter incidence of these effects. Signs of maternal toxicity in rabbits at this dose included mortality, abortions, marked reduction of food consumption, decreased water intake, body weight loss and hypoactivity. There was no evidence of teratogenicity when pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were given oral doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure). An increased incidence of smaller fetuses was observed at 100 mg/kg/day. In an oral pre- and postnatal development study conducted in rats, effects observed at 500 mg/kg/day included slight increases in duration of pregnancy and prenatal loss, reduced pup birth weight and decreased neonatal survival. Treatment-related maternal mortality occurred during gestation at 500 mg/kg/day in this study. Since there are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women, moxifloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: Moxifloxacin is excreted in the breast milk of rats. Moxifloxacin may also be excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants who are nursing from mothers taking moxifloxacin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established. Moxifloxacin causes arthropathy in juvenile animals. (See WARNINGS .) Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as AVELOX. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing AVELOX to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue AVELOX and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur (See BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS/Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports). In controlled multiple-dose clinical trials, 23% of patients receiving oral moxifloxacin were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral moxifloxacin in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults. In trials of intravenous use, 42% of moxifloxacin patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and 23% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous moxifloxacin in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator-treated patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Therefore, AVELOX should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia)."$$

There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between AVELOX and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Sotalol, a Class III antiarrhythmic, has been shown to further increase the QTc interval when combined with high doses of intravenous (IV) AVELOX in dogs.

"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroids, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Discontinue if pain or inflammation in a tendon occurs. ( 5.1 , 8.5 )-Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported. Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, hypokalemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3 , 7.4 , 8.5 ). Use caution in patients with proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia. ( 5.3 )-Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. ( 5.4 , 5.5 )-Central nervous system (CNS) events including dizziness, confusion, hallucination, depression, and rarely suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose. Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.6 )-Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.7 )-Peripheral neuropathy: Discontinue if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. [ see Adverse Reactions (6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).] Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse events, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid AVELOX in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. AVELOX has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of AVELOX the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). The drug should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia and patients receiving Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations. Pharmacokinetic studies between AVELOX and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed. An additive effect of AVELOX and these drugs cannot be excluded; therefore caution should be exercised when AVELOX is given concurrently with these drugs. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse events was similar in 798 AVELOX and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia, acute myocardial ischemia. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with AVELOX treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 AVELOX tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. Elderly patients using IV AVELOX may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation. [ see Use In Specific Populations, (8.5).] In addition, AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).] Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including AVELOX. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. AVELOX should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, may be administered as indicated. [ see Adverse Reactions (6) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).] Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including AVELOX . These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: -Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)-Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness-Allergic pneumonitis-Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure-Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure-Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.4). Fluoroquinolones, including AVELOX, may cause central nervous system (CNS) events, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4)]. Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, rarely, suicidal thoughts or acts. These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving AVELOX, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, AVELOX should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. [See Drug Interactions (7.4) Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3).] Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including AVELOX, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. Rare cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving quinolones including AVELOX. AVELOX should be discontinued if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy in order to prevent the development of an irreversible condition [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. The oral administration of AVELOX caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. [See Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2).] Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolone antibiotics after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs. [ see Adverse Reactions (6.4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3).] Prescribing AVELOX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]."$$
"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS NOT FOR INJECTION. VIGAMOX(R) solution is for topical ophthalmic use only and should not be injected subconjunctivally or introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. In patients receiving systemically administered quinolones, including moxifloxacin, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported, some following the first dose. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. If an allergic reaction to moxifloxacin occurs, discontinue use of the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management should be administered as clinically indicated. As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis."$$
"WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported. Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3 , 7.5 , 8.5 ) -Hypersensitivity and other serious reactions: Serious and sometimes fatal reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. ( 5.4 , 5.5 )-Central nervous system (CNS) events including dizziness, confusion, hallucination, depression, and suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose. Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.6 )- Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs ( 5.7 ).-Peripheral neuropathy: Discontinue if symptoms occur in order to prevent irreversibility. ( 5.8 ) Fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride the mean (\\302\\261 SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (\\302\\261 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (\\302\\26122) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (\\302\\261 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). Avoid Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations: -Known prolongation of the QT interval-Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions-Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia,-Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia-Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents-Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Elderly patients using intravenous Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)] In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Discontinue Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Other serious and sometimes fatal reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. These reactions may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: -Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)-Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness-Allergic pneumonitis-Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure-Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure-Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities Discontinue Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures. Fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, may cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions, including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares or paranoia. Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride may also cause central nervous system (CNS) reactions including: dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, suicidal thoughts or acts. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. As with all fluoroquinolones, use Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. [See Drug Interactions (7.4)] Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride and may be irreversible. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. In immature dogs, oral administration of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride caused lameness. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2).] As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride. In Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately. [See Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ).] Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2).] Prescribing Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."$$
